[{"content":"            tl;dr The exponential rise in content takedown orders on social media platforms due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998 ( DMCA) infringements in the recent past makes one wonder what the DMCA is and how it works. In this explainer, we provide an insight into how the DMCA came to be, how it affects us as Indian users of the internet and what we can do to peacefully coexist with DMCA.\nBackground On June 25, 2021 Twitter withheld the Twitter accounts of the former Minister of Information and Technology, Mr. R.S. Prasad and the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Technology, Mr. Shashi Tharoor for about an hour on grounds of alleged copyright infringement. Among the content moderation practices of social media accounts, one of the most frequently used reasons for censoring of online content is copyright infringement, specifically, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998 of the United States of America (DMCA). According to Google’s Transparency Report of July 2021, 96.2% takedown complaints related to copyright complaints under the DMCA. Similarly, Twitter users across the country encountered a deluge of account restrictions notices based on copyright violations. According to Twitter’s Transparency Report, between July 2020 and December 2020, it has withheld 684.6k accounts due to copyright breaches.\nMemes and GIFs have become almost an inextricable part of everyday conversations and to be aware of the intellectual property rights of each of these content can prove to be cumbersome. As such, you may have simply shared or forwarded an image or a song on your social media profile, completely oblivious to the copyright of that content but the proactive monitoring of most of the social media accounts is likely to flag that as a copyright infringement and withhold the post, or worse still, your account.\nWhat is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998 and why does it affect us in India? While this expansive sharing of content online has become the driving force of the internet, the need to protect the intellectual property of the creator of online content was felt globally. Thus, the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty (WIPO) of 1996 obligated the member nations and signatories of WIPO to protect within their respective jurisdictions the copyright of any content that may have been created by citizens of a different country. This effectively means that the DMCA will be applicable and be at par with the domestic copyright laws of every member country.\nIn 2018, India became a member of the WIPO Copyright Treaty, thereby granting the same legal enforceability to the DMCA as India’s existing domestic laws. Hence, we as internet users in India are not only governed by the Intellectual Property Laws in India like the Copyrights Act, 1957 or the Patents Act, 1970 but also the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998, as it applies to content originating from the USA.\nMoreover, most of the popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter and even Google are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, any copyright infringements recorded in any of these platforms will attract the wrath of DMCA for any offender, irrespective of their geographical location.\nWhat content can a DMCA notice take down? Since October 1998, the DMCA has acted as the overarching legislation to regulate the ethical use of content over the internet with the objective of preventing the abuse of any intellectual property rights. DMCA empowers users to approach any social media intermediary with verified requests to take down any content which violates their intellectual property rights. Most social media intermediaries maintain rapid response mechanisms to DMCA takedown notices but they also conduct their own due diligence before restricting any account or removing the content from their platforms. Additionally, social media intermediaries regularly deploy proactive monitoring measures through artificial intelligence or through expert oversight to identify potential copyright breaches on the websites and initiate appropriate actions against the alleged violators.\nThe evolving landscape of online content use, with increased automation in content moderation and the rising volume of requests from private users and governments has made DMCA takedowns error prone and susceptible to creating a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression. This must be juxtaposed with the John Doe orders or as they are known in India, Ashok Kumar orders. John Doe orders are injunctions issued preemptively against unknown or anonymous violators to protect the copyright of any digital content, in case the creators apprehend a potential breach of their content. Since 2003, Indian courts have warranted such pre-infringement injunctions but time and again, Courts have cautioned against overbroad and excessive use of the John Doe orders. Narrowing the scope of such orders, the Bombay High Court in Eros International and Anr v BSNL \u0026amp; Others (2016) SCC OnLine Bom 6948 provided strict guidelines for implementing a John Doe order. These principles hold true for DMCA notices too. Social media intermediaries therefore must follow due process before acting on any copyright complaints.\nWhat constitutes a DMCA notice? A DMCA violation notice, while designed to safeguard the intellectual property rights of online creators, also runs the risk of excessively clamping down on the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and expression of the users. Hence, section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA crystallises the processes to legitimise a DMCA complaint. For a DMCA complaint to be deemed proper, it must abide by the following six prerequisites:\n It must be authorised by the signature of the complainant The allegedly infringed copyrighted material must be identified. The allegedly infringing material must be duly identified. Contact information of the complainant must be provided. A statement of good faith belief in support of the complaint must be provided. In case, the complaint is raised by a third party, a statement of accuracy that authorizes the sender of a complaint to act on behalf of the copyright holder must be rendered.  Additionally, every social media intermediary proffers a multi-tiered compliance mechanism for any DMCA complaint. For instance, Twitter states that they do not instantaneously act on a DMCA notice but does so only upon internal review and assessment and after providing due notification to the alleged violator. In India, Twitter did not act on 40 “suspicious” DMCA notices following their independent probe. The guiding principles for social media intermediaries are the international standards of fair use and free speech.\nIn spite of such bulwarks against overbroad censorship, the reality of content moderation practices continue to be egregious. On several occasions, counter notices against DMCA complaints are not issued or are significantly delayed. Further, the grievance redressal processes are often non-committal.\nDo I have the right to appeal against a DMCA complaint? The DMCA provides statutory instructions about appeal against any DMCA takedown notice. This is complemented by the fact that every social media platform also has a provision of counter appeals against any content removal or restrictions pursuant to a DMCA notice through established grievance redressal mechanisms. In India, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 necessitates social media intermediaries to provide a notice to a user before disabling access to their account, as well as an adequate and reasonable opportunity to dispute the decision to disable access.\nHow do I check if my content violates the DMCA? The rising trend of DMCA violations on social media platforms can be attributed to exponential use of automation in content moderation which in turn helps in identifying multiple infringing content, thereby increasing the volume of takedown requests. According to Lumen Database, “​​The DMCA sits at the forefront of algorithmic law due to the potential it offers for automated enforcement of copyright at a large scale.”\nHowever, with the mammoth corpus of content available and circulating online, encounters with copyright barriers are increasing. While the appellate process enables us to fight against unreasonable and unwarranted takedowns, we must take an extra precautionary step to avert any takedown at the very outset.\nWe are listing below some of the industry best practices to make our social media content complaint with the DMCA:\n Check out for the source of the content before forwarding or sharing, including whether it states “all rights reserved” or brandishes a creative commons licence”, thus conferring selective rights to copy, share and reproduce while retaining the copyright. Not all copyrighted content infringe DMCA. Political speeches, newsworthy material or content which have manifest fair use elements in them. If your content falls within these categories, a DMCA notice will not be applicable to them. Prevention is better than cure and more so if we have the tools to prevent it. Google suite products provides a Content Match Tool for Youtube which warns one against any potential intellectual property infringement. Similarly, a quick copy paste on any popular plagiarism checker before posting on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram can save us any unpleasant surprises.  While these steps are not entirely foolproof, they certainly mitigate the chances of any unwanted squabbles with DMCA. Another vital source to take stock of the DMCA takedown notice is the Lumen Database, an online repository that collates and tracks content removal requests to online service providers, including DMCA takedown notices.\nImportant Documents  Shreya Tiwari, ‘Evolution of DMCA Notices: Trends and a Timeline’, Lumen Database, July 2, 2021****__ (link)**** The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/dmca-infringements-much-ado-about-copying/","summary":"In this explainer, we provide an insight into how the Digital Millennium Copyright Act came to be, how it affects us as Indian users of the internet and what we can do to peacefully coexist with DMCA.","title":"DMCA Infringements: Much Ado About Copying?"},{"content":"            tl;dr The e-commerce giant Amazon, a vendor on the platform named ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’, two websites, namely, “Students Database India” \u0026amp; “Students Database”, and shockingly a few government and school management officials have reportedly compromised the personal information of Class X and Class XII students across the country. Concerned about the threat to children\u0026rsquo;s privacy and safety caused by such data breaches, in July 2021, IFF sent thirty-two representations to the State and Union Territory Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights in India and filed three Right to Information (RTI) requests with the Central Board of School Education (CBSE), National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and the Ministry of Education’s Department of School Education and Literacy.\nBackground In June 2021, Ukhrul Times, Nagaland Express, and India Times broke the news of a pan-India personal data breach of Class X and Class XII students. Alarmingly, their names, father’s names, physical addresses, institution names, and even contact details including phone numbers and email addresses were revealed in these databases. The main individuals/entities involved in facilitating the sale of such information are:\nA. Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri and Amazon\nAccording to Ukhrul Times, a trader named ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’ collated the personal data of students to create the ‘Bihar Student Database’, ‘Haryana Student Database’, and ‘Nagaland Student Database’. What’s more concerning is that the e-commerce giant Amazon, which has over 100 million Indian users registered, facilitated ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’ in selling the databases priced at Rs. 299. The Nagaland Express has also reported that Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri claims that the data is “latest and verified”. In addition, the report suggests that Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri and Amazon have not made any effort to inform the students whose privacy has been compromised. Only after several parents raised concerns and reported the item to Amazon, was the link to purchase the student database taken down.\nB. Database and Students Database India\nIn addition to ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’, two websites, namely, “Students Database” and “Students Database India” are also selling the personal data of Indian children. The “Student Database” website presents a “record count” of the number of students whose data has been collated to prepare the database. On calculating the All India Class XII CBSE 2020-21 batch’s record count presented by the website, IFF learned that 13,14,756 children’s personal information has been compromised. In addition to the All India databases, this website has also put up region-specific databases for sale, each of which provides “free samples” of the student data. Further, the website also provides sixteen student databases at no cost. This leaves a whopping 9,04,963 students’ personal data freely available.\nThe database gives purchasers access to extremely sensitive information such as the student’s name, mobile number, gender, email address, and age. While Amazon had taken down the page to purchase the student databases sold by ‘Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri’, the two aforementioned websites are still operating.\nC. Government Departments and School Managements\nThe institutions created to safeguard the data of students are now reported to have partaken in the non-consensual disclosure of personal information themselves. A report published by The New Indian Express on July 21, 2021, claims that the staff and officers in the Tamil Nadu Education Department headquarters and in education departments across the state have been selling the personal information of Class X and Class XII students to colleges. Allegedly, a district education department official charged 2 rupees for each student’s mobile number. Similarly, The Times of India has reported that the administrative staff of schools in Nagpur are now charging anywhere between 2 rupees to 5 rupees per student’s personal data disclosure.\nConcerns on the Data Breach October 25, 2015, FirstPost, in a report, highlighted how sexual predators, on procuring children’s sensitive information such as their names and contact details - which was freely available on a university’s website - began to contact and lure them under the guise of offering career advice. In the current situation, similar possibilities of the critical misuse of examination data to commit such heinous acts cannot be ruled out, as students' personal information has been compromised by the aforementioned websites, vendors and officials. Similarly, in an interview conducted by The New Indian Express, a technology expert highlighted that in instances of such data breaches, there is a possibility of students’ contact numbers being uploaded on pornographic websites.\nFrom a legal perspective, this data breach violates the students’ fundamental right to privacy, as upheld by the Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1. Significantly, the decision highlighted the need to secure children’s right to privacy, bearing in mind that minors lack the legal capacity to give consent. Additionally, the Government of India, in 2005, had accepted two Optional Protocols to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). As a result, India endeavours to protect children from all forms of exploitation and arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. Hence, if necessary measures are not taken to protect the personal information of children, it would stand in violation of the Puttaswamy decision, and UNCRC’s Optional Protocols.\nSection 43A of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, holds bodies accountable if they fail to implement “reasonable security practices and procedures” when handling sensitive personal data. According to Section 72A of the Act, the websites, school managements and individuals involved in the mass student data breach can be imprisoned for a term of up to three years or/and can be fined up to five lakh rupees. However, considering the “Students Database India” website claims that they have been providing “100% genuine” data of students from every state and Union Territory for the past six years, the legal ramifications in place seem inadequate.\nIt is imperative to highlight that the rampant commercialisation of students’ personal information can be attributed to the exponential growth of ed-tech and remote education amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing this in mind, the motives of the database purchasers go unchecked as hackers, stalkers, scammers and unwanted marketers are now just a few clicks away from accessing a vast number of students’ personal information. This can leave several students vulnerable to fraud and identity theft, as individuals do not frequently change their personal information, especially email addresses and phone numbers.\nIFF’s Proactive Measures Concerned about the potential threats the aforementioned databases pose to the children’s safety and their right to privacy, on July 16, we wrote to twenty-eight State Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights and four Union Territory Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights to raise our grievances. We urged the Commissions to initiate an enquiry on the infringing websites (“Students Database”, “Students Database India”), the vendor (Shastri Nagar Charkya Puri) and the e-commerce platform (Amazon) and to also forward the case to the Magistrate having the jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The Commissions were also advised to frame and implement remedial measures and guidelines to prevent the leakage of students’ personal data henceforth.\nOn July 11, 2021, we filed an RTI request with the Ministry of Education’s Department of School Education and Literacy. To our dismay, on July 19, 2021, the Department replied solely to a query on the National Achievement Survey and disposed of our request. The problematic aspects of this reply are twofold. First, this insinuates that the Department has willfully chosen to not disclose the information. Second, even if the non-disclosure of information was not deliberate, it remains concerning as it insinuates that the Department does not have the pertinent information that we sought.\nSimilarly, on July 8, 2021, we filed an RTI request with the CBSE. We sought information related to whether the CBSE categorised and stored the students’ personal data. We also enquired about whether the CBSE makes privacy impact assessment reports or issues any Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) vis-a-vis students’ personal information protection. Lastly, on July 11, 2021, we filed an RTI request with the NCPCR. We inquired if the NCPCR had received any complaints regarding any incidents of students’ personal data breaches. However, we are still awaiting a response from both of the authorities.\nConclusion The elixir to the grave concerns on students’ data would be the creation of watertight legal provisions and policies to prohibit such data breaches. This opinion was shared by UNICEF in its report which highlighted the vulnerability of Indian children vis-a-vis data breaches. UNICEF also urged the government to enact stringent laws to tackle the menace of cybercrimes and secure children’s right to privacy. While the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is a welcome step towards data governance, it still falls short on several accounts. Our piece titled “#PrivacyOfThePeople - Why Student Data should be Students’ Data” offers a deep dive into the issues with the proposed law. In sum, the Bill makes no mention of either non-personal data or sensitive personal data. Considering the ubiquity of Indian student databases in the market, the possibility of students’ non-personal or sensitive personal data disclosure seems inevitable. In addition, unlike the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 1974, the Bill does not discuss data security practices at length.\nFrom a policy perspective, it is essential for Commissions and government bodies to work proactively to combat such data breaches. This includes ensuring data brokers and commercial entities adopt sustainable data security practices. Taking a leaf from the World Privacy Forum report, government agencies also ought to mandate educational institutions to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. Additionally, it is imperative to thwart the corrupt practices of government officials. Hence, governments on both - the state and national levels - must set up mechanisms to ensure accountability and transparency of education departments and school managements. To conclude, in light of students’ privacy and personal data being at stake, there is an imperative need to overhaul both - the legal and policy frameworks - to realise child rights in the digital age.\n    Link to the Representations sent to the State Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights     1.

The Parliament is expected to take up 38 bills that are pending before it including 9 for consideration and passing while 17 others are due for presentation. One of the key highlights of this session of the Parliament is the plausible ubiquity of issues related to digital rights in several of its debates.\nIronically, the first day of the Parliamentary session coincided with a massive controversy regarding alleged government sponsored surveillance of mobile phones of over 300 Indian journalists, politicians, human rights defenders and civilians through the military spyware, Pegasus, licensed by the Israeli firm, NSO Group. This incident reiterates the importance of legislative safeguards to our rights of privacy and digital security. As our dependence on the internet grows, so does our need for robust legislative frameworks that duly protect our personal data and other forms of cyber threats like doxxing, harassment, frauds, misinformation and surveillance.\nThus, we have decided to create a Legislative Brief on digital rights. The aim of this brief is to help legislators help understand the contours of debates about various topics related to digital rights and provide them with key insights into these issues. We also hope to inform larger policy conversations on these subjects. Here, we provide a short summary of our brief.\nKey statistics The number of broadband internet subscribers witnessed substantial increases: the number of broadband subscribers grew by 12.33% compared to February 2021 to 765.09 million. This was a result of a 12.20% increase in wireless broadband subscribers and a 16.73% increase in wireline subscribers.\nThe total number of internet subscribers (broadband + narrowband) also increased to 795.18 million by the end of December 2020, a growth of 2.41% compared to September 2020. Total internet penetration (number of subscribers per 100 population) increased by 2.13% to 58.51 over the same period, with urban and rural internet penetration rates rising to 103.98 (2.20% growth) and 34.6 (1.79%).\nSource: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicator Reports for October - December 2020 \u0026amp; July - September 2020\nWhile the data does show that on the whole access to digital infrastructure is increasing, as we have written earlier, a significant digital divide still remains. These figures highlight the rural-urban divide in terms of access to the internet, with the number of rural subscribers, despite making up a significant majority of the population, being only 63% of the number of urban subscribers. Rural internet density is also at around 33.27% of urban internet density. Clearly, large strides must still be made to reduce rural-urban differentials in internet access.\nPast Performance It may be reasonable to hope that in the upcoming sessions of the 17th Lok Sabha, pertinent questions around privacy will be raised. Within the larger scope of privacy issues, the largest category of the questions asked so far in the 17th Lok Sabha were related to data privacy concerns at 58 and 19 questions about the data legislation policies were raised. An astonishingly low number of questions (a meagre 5 questions) were about surveillance and snooping, while questions on Aadhaar data breaches were even lesser (only 3).\nBetween 2009 and 2021, the most number of questions were related to data privacy at 280 in Lok Sabha and 150 in the Rajya Sabha. While the Lok Sabha dealt with more questions on surveillance and snooping at 96, the Rajya Sabha merely had 17 questions on this issue. On the contrary, whereas Rajya Sabha relatively had more questions on Aadhaar breaches at 29, the Lok Sabha had entertained 43 questions related to it. A significant number of questions about the data protection legislation were raised in the Lok Sabha at 70 while in the Rajya Sabha 26 related questions were raised.\nWith respect to the party wise distribution of questions concerning privacy and data protection in Lok Sabha, the majority party, Bharatiya Janata Party had raised the most number of questions during the 17th Lok Sabha at 39, followed by the Indian National Congress which raised 16 questions on this topic. This was followed by regional parties like Shiv Sena, NCP, DMK, AITC among others, raising between 1 to 10 privacy related questions.\nStanding Committees During the Monsoon Session, 5 of the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committees have discussed issues that pertain to digital rights.\n1.The Standing Committee on Information and Technology : Entrusted with the task of supporting the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, this committee dealt with issues related to India’s preparedness for 5G, safeguarding citizens rights and prevention of misuse of social media/online news media platforms , ethical standards in media coverage , the Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill, 2019 , review of functioning of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), Citizens’ data security and privacy, safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social/online platforms and to hear the views of the representatives of Facebook, Twitter and Google.\n2. The Standing Committee on Home Affairs: This Committee specifically addressed the rising incidence of cybercrime against women and children.\n3. The Standing Committee on Finance: This committee focused on the subjects related to the digital economy. It conducted a meeting with representatives from the Department of Revenue and Economic Affairs and Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade to discuss how to finance the “innovation ecosystem” of India.\n4. The Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution : This Committee largely channelled its focus on the issue of digitisation of public distribution systems, specifically the Integrated Management of Public Distribution System and the One Ration, One Nation Scheme.\n5. The Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change: This Committee presented before the Rajya Sabha a report on the \u0026ldquo;The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019\u0026rdquo;. The report analysed some of the key issues with the bill. However, it failed to address the inherent issues with the bill with regards to the absence of personal data protection legislation, the threat of profiling and surveillance as well as privacy concerns.\nBudget Recap Budgetary allocations for selected items (Rs. cr)\nBack in early February, we had analysed the 2021-2022 Union Budget. As we had noted earlier, on one hand, the budget proposed several praiseworthy allocations, but on the other, several key schemes witnessed low allocations.:\n The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology: The Ministry witnessed a huge boost in allocations, with Rs. 9,720.7 crore being allocated to it in the Budget. This is mostly due to an increase in the allocation to the Digital India Program, which received Rs 6,806.3 crore. This itself stems from an increased focus on domestic manufacturing, as shown by the increased allocation of Rs. 2,631.3 crore towards the Promotion of Electronics and IT HW Manufacturing. However, the allocations for Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA) have significantly decreased, with only Rs. 300 crore being allocated in the Budget Estimates for 2021-21. The Department of Telecommunications: The Department was allocated Rs 58,737 crore in the Budget, a substantial increase of 43% over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates. This is largely due to a large increase in support to Public Sector Undertakings. Both BSNL and MTNL were provided with capital infusions for providing 4G services and grants-in-aid for the payment of GST, with the PSUs receiving Rs. 16,656 crore and 7,428 crore respectively. The Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) also witnessed a considerable increase in allocation: the net allocation increased to 9,000 crore, a 25% increase over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates. However, here it must be noted that a significant corpus of Rs. 58,083.86 crore (49.45% of the aggregate collection of funds) remains available for utilisation. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting: The Ministry witnessed a relatively modest (compared to other bodies in consideration) boost in allocations, with budgetary allocations going from Rs. 3,650.3 crore in the Revised Estimates of 2020-2021 to Rs. 4,071.2 crore in the Budget Estimates of 2021-2022. The growth in allocations originates from a robust 28% increase in Central Establishment Expenditure and a huge increase of 82% in funds allocated to Central schemes.  Issues to be taken up during session The importance of digital rights have grown leaps and bounds in recent times. As such it is anticipated that the parliament will deliberate upon some of the most important concerns related to digital rights. This pans across proposed legislation, rules as well as real time issues.\n The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019: The report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 which is posited as India’s overarching legislation governing data protection practices, was slated to be released during the current session of the Parliament. However, on Jul 22, 2021, this was postponed to the Winter Session of the Parliament. The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019: One of the most crucial issues to be taken up by the Parliament during the Monsoon Session is the **** DNA Technology ( Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019. Centred around the use of DNA technology in the justice delivery system, this bill raises concerns about privacy and surveillance norms and it is imperative that it is considered thoroughly and holistically before being passed. The Cinematograph Act, 1952: The Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill is scheduled to be tabled in the ongoing session of the Parliament. This Bill revolves around proposed amendments like subcategories of certification for films, stringent penal provisions for the menace of privacy as well as the changes to the power of the Central Board of Film Certification. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021: Arguably the most pressing issue of the larger digital rights debates is the new IT Rules, 2021. They have been notified and is expected to be tabled over the course of the current session of the Parliament. The Rules have been mired in controversy ever since they were notified. In its current form, they not only lack any clear rationale but also go beyond the scope of the parent statute. Further, they suffer from imprecise language, impose arbitrary obligations of content regulation, traceability and decryption upon intermediaries which in turn jeopardise the freedom of speech and expression as well as the Right to Privacy of the users. IFF has written to concerned authorities regarding raising a statutory motion in the Parliament in order to duly amend the Rules. The “Pegasus spyware” attack and citizens’ data security and privacy: The most sensational topic in the larger ambit of ‘digital rights’ in recent times has to be the leaked database containing phone numbers of over 300 prominent Indians, allegedly using the ‘Pegasus spyware”. This is a huge blow to the principles of privacy and freedom of speech and expression of the citizens as well as raises doubts about the surveillance practices of the governments. The Parliament must probe into the current data breach and formulate adequate steps to prevent any such leaks in the future. The Standing Committee on Information and Technology has summoned a meeting to discuss this specific issue on July 28. 2021.  Issues for consideration Since 2020, at least 16 consultations about digital technologies and digital rights have been undertaken by the Parliament. The topics under these consultations included data protection legislation, internet access, net neutrality enforcement, and digital infrastructure among others.\nFurther, it is of paramount importance to deliberate upon the broad themes listed below :\n Legislative Framework for Privacy: India is finally on the brink of receiving its first legislation which is formulated to be a comprehensive law on the protection of personal data. However, despite several rounds of consultations, in its current form the bill is wrought with concerns ranging from the collection of data without consent to weakened user rights to government overreach and surveillance. Covid and Technology: Right from the unilateral dependence on the web or mobile applications like CoWin for registrations for vaccination, or the Arogya Setu for undertaking long distance travel to the ubiquity of Aadhar card for accessing almost every essential health service, the enmeshing of technology for access to Covid related services have proven to be ill-timed and a hindrance for a large section of the citizens. Free speech and platform governance : In the last quarter of the year, we saw more stringent legislation regarding platform governance which not only governed social media intermediaries but also extended its applicability to OTT streaming platforms and “digital news media”. Simultaneously, incidents of state censorship of online speech have quadrupled. This calls to question both the efficacy as well as the proportionality of such measures. Internet access, internet shutdown, and net neutrality: Increasing incidents of internet shutdowns in India necessitates that due attention is focused on safeguarding the fundamental rights of the citizens. According to Access Now’s Report on Internet Shutdowns in 2020, out of 155 internet shutdowns reported across the globe, India shut down the internet 109 times. The enforcement of Net Neutrality is yet another disconcerting facet of India’s digital policies. Surveillance and facial recognition technology: In India, the threats of misuse of private information remain rather compelling. Not only the discretion to authorise surveillance lies solely with the executive, the judiciary too has not explicitly countered the use of surveillance technology by admitting evidences procured through such means as long as it is consented to and is relevant to the case; all this while there is no quantifiable proof of accuracy of the evidences derived out of surveillance. Digital technologies, social justice, and public welfare: The Internet has emerged as a medium to exercise the fundamental rights provided by the Constitution of India. Among the other debatable issues, the imposition of future digitalisation in Indian agriculture i.e. the Agristack has emergent ramifications on the data of the farmers. The other issues related to digital technologies and social justice that needs the Parliament’s attention include the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019, the National Digital Health Mission’s Health Data Management Policy and the Draft Code on Social Security, 2020, which makes Aadhaar based registration mandatory for receiving benefits.  This is IFF’s first attempt at drafting a Legislative Brief. The drafting of this brief was informed and indeed inspired by our conversations with various stakeholders and civil society organisations. We ask legislators and politicians, as well as the citizens of India, to provide us with inputs and feedback about how we can improve this brief here.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s Legislative Brief on Digital Rights - Monsoon Session 2021 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/iff-releases-legislative-brief-on-digital-rights-for-the-monsoon-session-of-the-parliament/","summary":"As the Monsoon Session of the Parliament commences, we have prepared our first legislative brief on digital rights to highlight some of the focus areas within the larger issues of data protection and digital rights that call for the extensive deliberation in the houses of the Parliament.","title":"IFF Releases Legislative Brief on Digital Rights for the Monsoon Session of the Parliament"},{"content":"            tl;dr On July 28, 2021, the Standing Committee on Information Technology will be having its sitting on the subject ‘Citizens’ data security and privacy’. In light of the revelations related to the Pegasus spyware that have been made since July 18, 2021, we wrote to the Standing Committee with specific questions for the Ministries of Home Affairs (MHA), Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (MeitY) and Communications (MoC).\nThe Pegasus revelations On July 18, 2021, The Wire, as part of an international collaborative investigation titled “Pegasus Project”, revealed that the Israeli spyware firm NSO targeted “over 300 verified Indian mobile telephone numbers, including those used by ministers, opposition leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, government officials, scientists, rights activists and others” through their spyware, Pegasus. The revelation was made on the basis of a leaked database accessed by Paris-based media nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International, which contains the list of numbers believed to have been targeted by NSO. NSO, according to its own website, sells exclusively to vetted government clients.\nSubsequent reporting by the Wire and the Washington Post revealed that forensic analysis conducted by Amnesty International\u0026rsquo;s Security Lab definitively showed that the Pegasus spyware had been used to target 37 phones, of which 10 belonged to Indians. While the leaked database contained the phone numbers of over 40 Indian journalists, the Security Lab was able to confirm that the Pegasus spyware was used to compromise the phones of former Indian Express journalist Sushant Singh, former EPW editor Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, former Outlook journalist S.N.M. Abdi and The Wire’s two founding editors Siddharth Varadarajan and M.K. Venu. The NSO Group asserted that the leaked database did not represent any list of numbers that were targeted by governments using Pegasus, and alluded that such a database may be accessed by its customers for ‘other purposes’.\nUse of the Pegasus spyware was first reported in India in 2019, however even after repeated requests to investigate its use in India, we did not gain any further insight into this issue. The way the spyware worked in 2019 is by its installation through a missed call on Whatsapp after which complete access to the smartphone could be gained. However, since then, NSO has been able to advance Pegasus’ developments to the extent that now Pegasus spyware infections can be achieved through so-called “zero-click” attacks, which do not require any interaction from the phone’s owner in order to succeed. Once Pegasus has been installed in the mobile device, it can harvest SMS messages, address books, call history, calendars, emails and internet browsing histories as well as gain access to and extract any files on the device.\nWhat did the government say? In response to these allegations, the Hon’ble Minister for Electronics \u0026amp; IT Ashwini Vaishnaw, in a statement made before the Lok Sabha, said that, “In India, there is a well established procedure through which lawful interception of electronic communication is carried out…” and “the time tested processes in our country are well-established to ensure that unauthorised surveillance does not occur.” (Read his entire statement here and our line by line verification of the statement here)\nHowever, the Minister has not explicitly denied whether the Government of India has acquired Pegasus and whether its use was authorised by the Government itself. Here it is important to note that no such power to hack the phones of Indian citizens exists under Indian law, and the pre-existing surveillance powers available under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking mobile devices. Hacking of computer resources, including mobile phones and apps, is in fact a criminal offence under S.66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is tasked with the maintenance of internal security. The current surveillance provisions allow the Central Government to temporarily intercept calls and/or messages in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public orderor for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence. However, if such tools have indeed been deployed, the burden of providing evidence to show that such thresholds are met lies with the government. If such aggressive and powerful tools for hacking have been deployed by the Government of India, then a question arises as to the legal framework under which these tools are being deployed. However, if such tools have been deployed by an external actor, then this too is a matter of grave concern. Important public figures are reported to have been affected by this attack, including current Cabinet Ministers and opposition politicians, and so this would constitute a grave assault on the privacy of the citizens of India as well as the digital safety.\nSimilarly, the Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (MeitY) is responsible for ensuring a safe and secure cyberspace for India. The Ministry of Communications (MoC) is responsible for ensuring secure telecommunications facilities to all the citizens of India. If the alleged attack has indeed taken place, this would constitute a significant lapse of duty.\nSection 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 allows the government to intercept, monitor or decrypt information. However, certain limitations are imposed on the exercise of such powers. These powers may be only exercised in case it is expedient to do so in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India and it is incumbent upon the government to provide the evidence to demonstrate that such a situation does indeed persist. Additionally, requests for interception can only take place on the basis of an order from the competent authority, which must then be reviewed by an appropriately constituted Review Committee. Orders for interception must also specify a specific timeframe (up to sixty days) for which such orders may be extended, but the total period for which the order for interception may be in force cannot exceed 180 days. The intermediary hosting the information in question must also be notified, and must send an acknowledgement of the receipt of the order to intercept information.\nIn case the alleged attack was conducted by an external actor, it must be questioned why such a heinous attack on the cyber security of India citizens was allowed to take place. The matter must be investigated by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) with extreme prejudice.\nWe sent our questions for the Government to the Standing Committee in Information Technology The Standing Committee on Information Technology will be having a sitting on the subject of “Citizens’ data security and privacy” on July 28, 2021. This is an extremely timely intervention into the entire Pegasus revelations and mindful of the importance of this sitting, we have sent a letter to the Committee with certain questions for the MHA and MeitY \u0026amp; MoC.\nTherefore, we pose the following questions for the MHA:\n Has the MHA or any agency under the Ministry procured the Pegasus software? What were the financial considerations? Has the MHA deployed the Pegasus tool? Since hacking is a criminal offense as per Indian law, how is the use of Pegasus being authorised in India? If such tools have indeed been used, were these surveillance requests issued and reviewed by competent authorities? If orders for interception and monitoring have been issued, what is the time period for such orders were in force? To which intermediaries have such orders been sent? Is the MHA contemplating conducting an investigation into possible origins of the alleged attack? What are the steps that are being taken to ensure that such violations of the fundamental rights of an Indian citizen are not repeated and that the digital safety \u0026amp; security of Indian citizens are not compromised? Has the MHA sent any questionnaire to the NSO Group and sought specific disclosure from them?  Additionally, we posed the following questions for the MeitY and the MoC:\n Were the MeitY and/or MoC or any agency under the ministries involved in the procurement of Pegasus by the MHA and/or any other agency/authority of the Government of India? Has the MeitY and/or MoC deployed the Pegasus tool? Since hacking is a criminal offense as per Indian law, how is the use of Pegasus being authorised in India? If such tools have indeed been used, were these surveillance requests issued and reviewed by competent authorities? If orders for interception and monitoring have been issued, what is the time period for which such orders were in force? To which intermediaries have such orders been sent? Is the CERT-IN contemplating conducting an investigation into possible origins of the alleged attack? What are the steps that are being taken to ensure that such violations of the fundamental rights of an Indian citizen are not repeated and that the digital safety \u0026amp; security of Indian citizens are not compromised? Has the MHA sent any questionnaire to the NSO Group and sought specific disclosure from them?  IFF will continue to fight for your privacy! The Pegasus revelations have shocked the country by demonstrating how developments in technology are failing to keep up with the democratic ideals of the past. In our initial statement on the issue, we asked the Government to stand by democratic commitments and reject the use of spyware in their pursuit of social objectives of policing and security as well as to introduce legislative measures in Parliament to uphold the Right to Privacy decision of the Supreme Court of India recognising privacy as a fundamental right. We will continue to fight for your rights and keep you updated on the further developments on this issue.\nImportant Documents  Letter to IT Standing Committee on Pegasus Attacks dated July 22, 2021 (link) IFF’s Statement on Hacking Revelations made by the Pegasus Project dated July 19, 2021 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/dear-standing-committee-we-have-some-questions-on-pegasus/","summary":"We wrote to the Standing Committee on IT with questions for the MHA, MeitY and MoC related to the Pegasus revelations.","title":"Dear Standing Committee, We Have Some Questions on Pegasus"},{"content":"            Tl;dr In the continuation of our weekly series #PrivacyOfThePeople, we look at the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on different sections of society, from farmers to patients. In this post, we examine the growing interest in students’ data and what the Bill has to say when it comes to student data. We explore the need to secure such data as well as why current regulations inadequately protect student data.\nBackground Last week, in the fourth post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we looked at healthcare data under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. We took a deep dive into the merits and demerits of the Bill when it comes to protecting the medical records of patients. In the past, we have also covered the impacts of the Bill on workers, farmers, and social media users.\nThis post continues to discuss how different groups of people are affected by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. This week, we’re taking a look at why there is an increasing interest in student data and whether the Bill adequately protects such data. Specifically, student data largely entails the data of students and their guardians, which is collected and processed by schools, colleges, governmental organisations, and ed-tech companies.\nThe issue According to a Comparitech report, US schools and colleges have leaked 24.5 million student records in 1,327 data breaches since the year 2005. This is now a global issue that has become much more relevant in India, even more so with the increased digitization of student records due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From admission right up to graduation, educational institutions constantly collect, store, process, and generate huge amounts of data. This data can intentionally or unintentionally end up in someone else’s hands. In a 2018 data breach, the information of 250,000 students who appeared for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) was being publicly sold, without the consent or knowledge of the students. The personal data had been obtained by merely requesting schools and offering free NEET mock tests. Just this year, staff and education officers in Coimbatore had been allegedly selling student data using the Education Information Management System (EMIS) portal.\nAt the time of admission, schools may typically ask for names, ages, addresses, photographs, sex, religion, Aadhaar numbers, birth certificates, details of siblings, parents’ names, parents’ qualifications, family income, telephone numbers, email addresses, etc. Once admitted, financial data such as bank account details, and health data such as blood group, allergies, weight, height, immunizations, regular medication (if any), dental check-ups, eye check-ups, etc. are also usually added. Additionally, most schools maintain progress reports, participation details, and disciplinary records of students. Schools thus regularly collect and process large amounts of personal data of not only students but also their guardians. The question then arises - “What happens to this student data?”\nUnlike other kinds of data, student data is a lot more comprehensive - it is several fields of a student’s and guardian’s personal data. This makes it of much greater interest to data broker companies that buy and sell information about consumers from a wide variety of sources. This student data can end up anywhere. It generally ends up with companies providing services such as coaching facilities, educational loans, insurance, or regular advertising. Colleges too may be interested in obtaining data from schools. While there have been cases where schools themselves have played a role in selling student data, most of the time, this is done without the management’s knowledge. Apart from this data profiting others, it even risks the possibilities of phishing, extortion, and ending up on pornographic websites.\nThis issue isn’t limited to schools alone, but also extends to universities, ed-tech companies, governmental and private boards and organizations that manage curriculums and conduct various examinations. The College Board is notorious when it comes to selling student data. The American organisation popularly known for conducting exams such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), was reported to be selling test-takers’ information to elite universities for 47 cents per name. These universities use this data to boost their image of exclusivity (by inviting students they don’t intend on accepting to apply and pay a good application fee), in an attempt to help boost their national rankings.\nThe PDP Bill and Student Data\nSchools, universities, educational organisations, and ed-tech companies, all classify as “data fiduciaries” (data collectors) for the purposes of the PDP Bill. As such, they are required to fulfill all obligations under Chapter II, that is, Sections 4 to 11, particularly those dealing with purpose limitation, the requirement of consent, etc., as well as the accountability and transparency measures specified in Chapter VI. Since these groups inevitably process large volumes of personal data of children, they will also be regulated as guardian data fiduciaries for the purpose of Chapter IV of the Bill and the regulations made under them. Yet, since the Bill only protects personal data, non-personal student data is still at risk. As we have written extensively earlier, in today’s world anonymised data means very little.\nConsidering the volume and sensitivity of personal data processed, the Data Protection Authority (DPA) may also seek to regulate schools as Significant Data Fiduciaries under Section 26 of the Bill. Government-run schools may also be regulated differently if they are classified as a “service provided by a government” under Section 12(a)(i) of the Bill.\nFurthermore, the Bill fails to adequately safeguard data of any sort in the case of data breaches. Clause 25 which deals with the breach of personal data states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary must inform the Data Protection Authority, not the principal themself. Moreover, there are no penalties imposed on the data fiduciaries in the event of a data breach.\nSolution To remedy some of these problems, here are a few of our recommendations:\n Schools, colleges, organisations, and ed-tech companies to process data responsibly: This is to be done in compliance with the PDP Bill. If any sort of data processors are hired, they will need to be monitored to ensure compliance. Such data processors may only be appointed vide a contract and are bound by the instructions of the Data Fiduciary and must treat data as confidential as per Section 31 of the Bill. Student Rights must be upheld: As stakeholders of their data, explicit consent should be taken before processing any data. If data is being monetized, students and their guardians must be made aware of this. Under Section 9 of the Bill, students, as data principals, have the right to ask for the erasure of their data at any given time. Processing of student data must not be done in a way that profits others when it violates basic privacy rights. Protect Non-Personal Data: Allow non-personal and anonymized data to be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for non-personal data.

However, in a bid to create a more robust compliance mechanism, the rules run the risk of creating greater fault lines in India’s e-commerce industry through increased compliance burdens and broad gauge definitions. Read our submission to the Department of Consumer Affairs on on the proposed amendments to Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020.\nBackground For the last couple of years, e-commerce and online shopping have increasingly become a key part of the consumer experience. These trends were provided a further flip by the COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown, as an increasing number of people were forced to shop online. This resulted in a 46% growth in sales volume year-on-year for Q4 of 2020, which translated to a 43% growth in value! What’s more, this growth was not just limited to urban metropolises: 90% of the incremental growth came from tier 2 and tier 3 cities.\nHowever, as might be expected, this growth has brought with it an increase in both e-commerce fraud and consumer manipulation. The number of cases of e-commerce fraud has jumped nearly six times from 977 cases in FY17 to 5,620 cases in FY20 till November 2019. Meanwhile, the number of e-commerce complaints raised through the national consumer helpline during FY2020 stood at 1,54,122, compared to 1,03,364 during FY2019, a rise of almost 50%. Between April 2020, and February 2021, this figure increased further to 1,88,262 complaints. Clearly, there is a dire need to protect the interests of consumers online, especially in the digital age where the larger e-commerce entities can deploy various methods to dupe consumers without technically resorting to fraud.\nOn June 21, 2021, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs put out proposed amendments to the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020. The government stated that “Prevalence of such unfortunate incidents has negatively impacted the consumer and business sentiment in the market, causing immense distress and anguish to many. It was observed that there was an evident lack of regulatory oversight in e-commerce which required some urgent action. Moreover, the rapid growth of e-commerce platforms has also brought into the purview the unfair trade practices of the marketplace e-commerce entities engaging in manipulating search result to promote certain sellers, preferential treatment to some sellers, indirectly operating the sellers on their platform, impinging the free choice of consumers, selling goods close to expiration etc.”\nThus, to address such issues, they had proposed the aforementioned amendments. While we support some of the changes proposed, we believe certain problems emerge from the new framework, while certain provisions need further clarification.\nIssues with the amendments While we appreciate the intent of these Rules to bolster platform neutrality and empower consumers against malpractices and price manipulation, we are concerned that it fails to provide definitive structure to the proposed changes and evokes fears regarding implementation. In our submission on the proposed amendments, we highlighted our caveats to the changes under seven broad categories:\n Need for clarity in the definition of ‘flash sale’: The ubiquity and rising popularity of flash sales is one of the most characteristic features of the e-commerce industry. However, allegations of marked up and predatory pricing in the guise of these sales have brought several e-commerce giants like Amazon and Flipkart under scrutiny. Regulation of flash sales is indeed a much needed provision. However, it breeds major confusion since Rule 3(b) fails to adequately distinguish between flash sales by e-commerce entities and “conventional” flash sales by third party sellers. Blanket prohibition on predictive pricing might do more harm than good: Rise in e-commerce market has also generated increased incidents of fraud. Such malpractices sometimes assume a more sinister form by deploying dark patterns which are user interface design choices that manipulate the individual into carrying out these reluctant behaviours. Additionally, companies deploy ‘sludge’, which includes practices such as making it difficult to change privacy settings or cancel subscriptions, as well as deliberately hiding key terms and conditions. In that regard, the Rule 14(3) provides the much needed safeguards against breach of consumer rights. However, when done within ethical limits, predicted search results help consumers make their purchasing choices more easily. Therefore an overarching limitation is likely to disable the benefits that intuitive tech like predicted search results bring. Overbroad definition of ‘e-commerce entity’: Rule 3(1)(b) broadens the definition of ‘e-commerce entity’ to include any subsidiaries as well as “related parties” of the e-commerce entity. This entails any entity associated with the e-commerce entities in any commercial capacity will also incur liabilities under the said Rules. These may include offline vendors, delivery partners et al. This creates a major hurdle because such related parties would now have to undertake the obligation to appoint a Chief Compliance Officer, a Resident Grievance Officer and a Nodal Officer [Rule 5(5)] along with other obligations mentioned in the rules, merely because they work with an e-commerce entity. Such overbroad definitions will dissuade ancillary partners of e-commerce entities from working in the e-commerce industry. Disproportionate burden of compliance placed upon e-commerce entities: Commendably, the new rule 5(1), expands the scope and applicability of the rules from only registered companies but also to limited liability partnerships. However, this broadened definition also falls short of being comprehensive since it leaves out smaller entities under the Shops and Establishment Act, 1953 who may choose to undertake sale online. Accordingly, the confusion regarding regulatory obligations of appointing a nodal officer persists. Moreover, it places upon them the additional burden of appointing a nodal officer which not only will be superfluous to domestic entities but especially be a hassle for the foreign entities and increase the cost implications of the e-commerce entities. The absence of clear thresholds further forged a conflict between the obligations under the Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) regulations, 2018 and the current rules. One size fits all approach for appointment of officers: The proposed amendments further places upon all e-commerce entities, irrespective of its size and value, the onerous responsibility of appointing a chief compliance officer, a nodal officer and a grievance officer This one size fits all approach will adversely impact small scale e-commerce entity. Rules prohibit what is already not permitted: The proposed Rule 5(17) prohibits e-commerce entities from abusing dominant position in any market. However under section 19 of the Competition Act, 2002, an entity stands to be penalised for engaging in a dominant position. It therefore ends up being redundant. Micromanagement by government, enhancing the risk of over-compliance: If redundancy in grievance mechanisms weren’t enough, the rules also include provisions for overbroad state interference under rule 5(18). This necessitates e-commerce entities to comply with any request for information under section 69 of the Information Technology Act within 72 hours. Here, not only is the type of “information” not clarified but also the overarching timeline creates the tendency of e-commerce entities to overcomply without actually resolving the issue.  Recommendations In light of the above issues, we believe the following changes must be made:\n Stricter definition of ‘flash sale’: The definition of ‘flash sale’ should be modified to address the lack of clarity. To this extent, the phrase ‘ordinary course of business’ must be adequately defined (as may be found in this press release). Keep tools to reduce manipulation but allow voluntary predicted searches: We welcome the addition of clauses 14 to guard against consumer manipulation, as these will help to limit the possibility of such frauds and protect the rights of consumers online. However, we believe there is a need for clarification on the provision regarding search indexes. A proviso should be added to the Rule that allows consumers to voluntarily opt-in to receiving expected search results. Size based classification for e-commerce entities: The Ministry should not consider all entities which are engaged to fulfil orders as e-commerce entities. However, in light of the investigations into Amazon, there is also a need to protect against anti-competitive practices. Thus a classification based on the size of the entity should be used to categorise companies as e-commerce entities. Overbroad scope of compliance: The government must issue the necessary clarifications regarding the existing conflict between the FDI regulations and the liabilities enforced by the rules at the earliest. Reduce human capacity requirements for compliance: The cost implications and resource impact of the appointment of three separate officers to deal with compliance and grievances must be reconsidered. We suggest that the Ministry does not adopt such a one-size-fit-all approach and instead impose the obligation of Rule 5(5) only on those entities which have specified turn-over or large number of active users. Allow competent bodies to take action: The proposed rules will legally enable individuals to engage in forum shopping, a practice which courts have repeatedly frowned upon. While already established entities may be able to defend themselves in multiple proceedings, newly established businesses will find it difficult. Authorities under the rules may also be unable to properly determine if an entity has abused dominant position. Thus, only competent bodies should be allowed to \u0026hellip; Relax timelines for compliance: Compliance requirements should be on the best efforts basis, gleaned through the lens of legality, proportionality and necessity and seconded by orders of a competent court of law.

In this post, we outline the steps we have taken to ensure and promote women’s safety and security on the internet in light of this incident.\nWhat happened? On July 4, 2021, multiple Twitter accounts posted the screengrab from an application hosted on GitHub titled, “Sulli Deals”. The application shared the photographs and social media handles of more than 80 women belonging to the Muslim community in India. The application showcased the information of the women in a way that the user could “claim a ‘sulli”, which is a derogatory term used by right-wing trolls in India for Muslim women, as the “deal of the day”. The aim of the application was to objectify and demean the targeted women by allowing them to be auctioned for sale to the users of the application.\nAs a result of the public outcry against the application, GitHub removed the application. The National Commission for Women took suo motu cognisance of the incident and asked the Delhi Police to file FIRs against the perpetrators as well as to submit an action taken report within ten days. Additionally, the Delhi Commission for Women also issued notice to the Delhi Police on the incident and asked for a detailed action taken report. Subsequently, the Cyber Cell of Delhi Police registered FIRs under S. 354-A of the Indian Penal Code which relates to sexual harassment. Additionally, one of the targeted women, Pilot Hana Khan, also filed a FIR with the Delhi Police under S. 509 of the IPC which relates to acts intended to insult the modesty of a woman and S. 66 \u0026amp; 67 of the Information Technology Act which relates to hacking and publishing of obscene information in electronic form respectively.\nHowever, according to an update posted on Twitter, there is a new domain which has been registered, but not yet hosted, on GoDaddy.com titled, “sullidealing.co.in”.\nThe relevant authorities have failed to identify the actual issue While indeed these are relevant provisions, we feel they fail to adequately address the nature of the crime in the current incident. The application categorically targeted women belonging to the Muslim community and therefore, this is not only an act of gender based harassment but also an instance of targeting on the basis of religion. The application targeted these women specifically because of their religious identity as the aim of the application was not just to sexually harass women but to also demean Muslim women and their community by objectifying them and reducing them to “auction items”. This is evident from the fact that the application title itself contains a derogatory slang term used to denote Muslim women specifically and not just women in general. Therefore, we are of the view that while the provisions related to sexual harassment, insult to the modesty of a woman and publication of obscene information are relevant here, this investigation is incomplete unless and until the Delhi Police as well as the NCW \u0026amp; the DCW take cognisance of the fact that this incident was religiously motivated.\nAccordingly, we feel it is exigent that the concerned investigative agencies charge the accused(s) under the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned provisions:\n Section 153 A of the IPC which punishes any “persons who indulge in wanton vilification or attacks upon the religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc of any particular group or class or upon the founders and prophets of a religion.” Section 295 A of the IPC which penalises “deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs”. Section 298 of the IPC which punishes anyone who “with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places, any object in the sight of that person.”  Our concerns We are concerned that such incidents will adversely impact the constitutional rights and personal safety of the internet users who might continue to be subjected to harassment through the similar websites \u0026amp; applications and inflict serious threats to the privacy and safety of those targeted on the basis of their religion and gender.\n Displaying sensitive information without consent to intimidate and/or harass women is violative of Art. 21 of the Indian Constitution: The application conducted a “auction” of the targeted Muslim women for over 20 days, by using sensitive information like the photographs and social media handles of the women. Needless to say, these “deals” elicited lewd, perverse and horrifying comments from a vast number of users. While there was no actual auction of any human being, the main goal of this application was to dehumanise and intimidate women who were targeted. This has affected the personal safety and security of those targeted, thus violating their constitutional right to life, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and has undermined their right to privacy, deemed an integral component of the “right to life” by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1. Doxxing and online harassment of women infringes upon the freedom of speech and expression of women: Social media platforms are the town halls of our modern times. Yet, the persistent incidents of sexual harassment and doxxing have made these platforms highly unsafe and toxic for women, ultimately leading them to disengage from social media altogether after facing harassment. According to a study conducted by Plan International, one in every five young women have opted out of social media after being targeted or harassed. The abuses are further aggravated in cases of women who voice their opinions as well as those women who belong to minority communities on social media platforms and in turn, dissuade them from expressing themselves without any fear or inhibitions. This squarely violates the women’s right to freedom of speech and expression enshrined in Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution. Delayed response to curb the spread of such vitriolic information undermines the digital security of women online: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, your terms of service lack the obligation to protect the data collected or govern the sharing of such sensitive information, within the purview of purpose limitation and exacerbates the privacy and security threats. Further, in the absence of any narrowly defined safeguards against data breach, practices of doxxing and online sexual harassment can continue with impunity. Moreover, the failure of the law enforcement bodies to initiate any prompt action is likely to cause a loss of deterrence for similar miscreants. Instances of online harassment has vitiated the experience of internet use for women all across the world: According to a survey of more than 8,000 respondents undertaken by the Web Foundation, “half of young women and girls in the global survey have experienced online abuse, including threatening messages, sexual harassment and the sharing of private photos and videos without permission”.

The revelation was made on the basis of a leaked database accessed by Paris-based media nonprofit Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International, which contains the list of numbers believed to have been targeted by NSO. NSO, according to its own website, sells exclusively to vetted government clients.\nSubsequent reporting by the Wire and the Washington Post revealed that forensic analysis conducted by Amnesty International\u0026rsquo;s Security Lab definitively showed that the Pegasus spyware had been used to target 37 phones, of which 10 belonged to Indians. While the leaked database contained the phone numbers of over 40 Indian journalists, the Security Lab was able to confirm that the Pegasus spyware was used to compromise the phones of former Indian Express journalist Sushant Singh, former EPW editor Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, former Outlook journalist S.N.M. Abdi and The Wire’s two founding editors Siddharth Varadarajan and M.K. Venu. The NSO Group asserted that the leaked database did not represent any list of numbers that were targeted by governments using Pegasus, and alluded that such a database may be accessed by its customers for ‘other purposes’.\nAccording to ANI, the Government of India, in response to a questionnaire sent by the Pegasus Project stated that, “the allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever”. The response also mentioned that in India there is a well established procedure for lawful interception of electronic communications under S.5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and S.69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which ensures any interception, monitoring or decryption carried out is done as per the due process of law. Read the GOI’s full response here.\nHere, we would like to emphasise that this response by the Government is insufficient and fails to respond conclusively to the detailed reporting by the Pegasus Project. Further, no such power to hack the phones of Indian citizens exists under Indian law, and the pre-existing surveillance powers available under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking mobile devices. Hacking of computer resources, including mobile phones and apps, is in fact a criminal offence under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and it is only through such hacking that the Pegasus spyware can be used against a person.\nThis revelation reveals a need for urgent surveillance reform to protect citizens against the use of such invasive technologies which hamper their fundamental right to privacy and threatens the democratic ideals of our country. Use of such surveillance technology on journalists leads to a chilling effect as it precludes them from working and reporting on sensitive matters, some of which may also be against the ruling government, without jeopardising themselves and the personal safety of their sources. It also stops human rights defenders from working with vulnerable people, some of whom may have been victimised by their own government, without opening them up to further abuse.\nWe call on the Government to stand by democratic commitments and reject the use of spyware in their pursuit of social objectives of policing and security. Legislative measures must be introduced in Parliament to uphold the Right to Privacy decision of the Supreme Court of India recognising privacy as a fundamental right. The use of legal or technical means to access data and intercept communications in India must be authorised only in emergency situations, under judicial control and oversight, and with other protections to safeguard our citizens.\nOver the next few weeks, we at IFF will attempt to reach out to any victims of illegal surveillance in India and we will make every attempt to ensure that they can access the legal system to seek redress. We will also examine avenues for further engagement with all branches of government - legislative, executive and judicial- to advance our ongoing work on surveillance reform. This would also involve furthering our work on data protection legislation, including advocating for comprehensive data protection frameworks such as a private member’s bill by Dr. Ravikumar titled the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019, which if enacted may help prevent such a recurrence, as well as our surveillance reform PIL which was filed in the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 2019. Further, in December 2020, IFF, along with eight other civil society organisations had also filed an amici brief before the ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals in California to oppose the NSO Group’s attempt to evade responsibility for the Pegasus Hack. In addition to seeking transparency through full disclosure under the Right to Information Act as well as other avenues, we hope to work towards solutions to ensure that something like this never happens again.\nImportant Documents  Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 introduced in Parliament (link) IFF’s Surveillance Reform PIL (W.P.

And India\u0026#39;s Incoming Data Laws need your urgent attention.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;          Tl;dr The report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is to be submitted next week. Here, we look at the possible ways forward for the Bill, highlight some of the issues that may emerge, and provide recommendations for addressing them.\nBackground Last year, several media reports indicated that the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 would submit its report to the Parliament during the Budget session. However, as we know, that did not happen. In fact, on March 25, 2021 a motion was moved to extend the time for the presentation of the report and was adopted the very same day. Thus, the report of the Committee is now scheduled to be presented in the first week of the upcoming Monsoon Session i.e. the week starting 19th July. The speaker of the Lok Sabha has also explicitly stated that no further extension will be granted to the committee.\nIn recent time, we have written extensively on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 through:\n Our #StartFromScratch series, which was a short introduction to the Bill which included some historical and legislative context, a summary of the Bill, an overview of the issues with the Bill, and possible alternative paradigms for data protection. Next, through our #DataProtectionTop10 series, wherein we analysed the top 10 issues with the Bill in detail. Currently, through our #PrivacyOfThePeople series which is looking at how the Bill will impact our daily lives by focusing on its impact on different sections of society  However, now that Session is almost here, we thought it would be helpful to look at the potential ways forward for the JPC, and indeed answer the question: what will happen to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 now?\nThe Report of the Committee Once the Committee submits its report under Rule 77 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha (‘Lok Sabha Rules’), there are several options available for moving forward:\n The Bill along with the modifications proposed by the JPC can be taken up for consideration. The Bill can once again be given back to the JPC (this could be the same committee or even a newly constituted committee). The Bill can be circulated amongst the members of the Lok Sabha to elicit further opinion thereon.  If option 1 is chosen i.e. if the modified Bill is taken up for consideration, then Members of Parliament retain the option of moving a motion asking for the Bill to be sent back to the JPC or that it be circulated among MPs for deliberation.\nIn the case of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, it is likely that option 1 will be taken, as discussions on the Bill have been going on since 2018 and MPs will be hesitant to send the Bill back to the JPC again. Thus, it would seem that everything is now done and dusted: the report will be tabled, the Government will introduce a new version of the Bill, and, given the numbers, the Bill will most probably pass.\nPotential Issues However, the picture isn’t over yet. For starters, Rule 331D of the Lok Sabha Rules clearly states that a Minister cannot be appointed as a member of the Committee. Now, during the recent cabinet reshuffle, 5 members of the Committee - Meenakshi Lekhi, Ajay Bhatt, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Bhupender Yadav, and Ashwini Vaishnaw - were appointed as Ministers. This means that, immediately, there are now 5 vacancies in the JPC. In fact, MP Meenakshi Lekhi was the chairperson of the JPC, so as of now the JPC is also sans chairperson!\nAnother is that, as multiple sources have suggested, the report may substantially expand the scope of the Bill to include non-personal data. Currently, clause 91 of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 allows the government to frame policies for regulating non-personal data. The Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework had released the second draft of its report for the proposed governance framework on December 16th, 2020. However, the framework proposed by the committee may be unconstitutional. Four major concerns emerge form the framework:\n Overbroad definitions: The report provides an extremely broad definition of non-personal data by defining it in opposition to personal data as defined in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Issues arise in the context of both implementation and jurisprudence when trying to ascertain whether a given piece of data is ‘personal’ or ‘non-personal’. The proposed relationship between the Bill and the framework may also not adequately address concerns about privacy and data security. Risk of de-anonymisation: As the report itself has noted, the threat of de-anonymization is a grave one against which adequate barriers must be maintained. Given that a large portion of non-personal data will consist of anonymised personal data, it is vital that such issues be dealt with. The relative ease of de-anonymization has already been highlighted in various contexts (see here and here), while the situation in India is worsened by the lack of adequate data protection legislation. Over-extraction of data and a race to the bottom: The proposed version of the governance framework may enable data maximisation, wherein there is overreach in data collection by various entities. Besides the natural issues related to consent, the economic rationale given to bolster the claim that a profusion of data generation and conclusion may not hold up, and may instead lead to the exploitation of citizens. Any engagement with data monopolies and market failure in the realm of data has been cursory at best and here domains of competition law remain underutilized in India.  Should such provisions for regulating non-personal data be included within the Bill, then these would constitute a significant change in the ambit of the Bill, and so, under the pre legislative consultation policy, require a further round of consultation.\nLastly, in a democratic country, the government must be held accountable. Currently, it is possible that the Government accepts the report of the Committee and then proceeds to wholly disregard its suggestions. This may not be in accordance with a democratic ethos, and so it is imperative that when the government finally presents the modified Bill, it also provides its rationale for either accepting or rejecting each of the recommendations of the JPC.\nSuggestions In light of these issues, we have the following suggestions;\n Fill vacancies: It is within the power of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to appoint a chairperson, given the urgency of the matter. This must happen immediately, so that the process is not held up due to administrative difficulties. Fresh round of consultation if substantial changes are present: The non-personal data governance framework proposed by the government has several issues. If such a framework is to be enshrined through the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, this is a grave worry, and so conducting new consultations would be essential. Provide rationale for decision: A democratic government must be accountable for its actions, and so it is of paramount importance that, before presenting the final version of the Bill, the government provides its reasons for accepting or rejecting each suggestion of the JPC.

Here are some staggering details we found from the first round of IT Rules reports.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;          tl;dr Google, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter have released their transparency reports in compliance with Rule 4(1)(d) of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the 2021 IT Rules). The reports highlight some interesting facts and figures, e.g. WhatsApp banned over 2 million Indian user accounts in one month; and 98.4% of Google’s nearly 60,000 removal actions related to copyright claims.\nBackground The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (2021 IT rules) were issued in February, 2021 and came into effect with respect to significant social media intermediaries in May, 2021. The 2021 IT Rules have triggered numerous debates about its applicability and legality ever since it was notified. We have written extensively about the Rules and are likely to be taken up for discussion at the monsoon session of the seventeenth Lok Sabha, However, while they remain in force, social media platforms are obligated to comply with its provisions. One such provision of the 2021 IT Rules (Rule 4(1)(d)) requires social media platforms to publish monthly compliance reports.\nIn these reports, they are required to mention the details of complaints received and action taken thereon, and the number of specific communication links or parts of information that the social media platform has removed or disabled access to by proactive monitoring.\nSome of the big social media companies have released their first compliance reports recently. We examined them to glean some of the most important information for you.\nTwitter still has not complied with this requirement First things first, Twitter has not complied properly with this requirement. Twitter has earlier been in the news for its continued non-compliance with various parts of the Rules, including non-appointment of grievance officers. Twitter’s reports relate to the period between July and December, 2020, whereas to be in compliance with the 2021 IT Rules, Twitter is required to release a monthly report for each month. Which means that Twitter was required to release a report disclosing their May/June 2021 activities.\nNonetheless, Twitter reports that it received 12,435 legal demands for content removal, of which only 67 were Court orders. This means that 12,368 removal demands were received by Twitter from the Government. No other country in the world issued as many removal demands to Twitter. Interestingly, Twitter reported a 0.6% compliance rate for information requests, and 9% for removal requests.\nThe Facebook group of platforms see millions of takedown actions monthly Facebook and Instagram released a combined compliance report, which did not disclose the number of complaints received through the grievance officer route, nor the action taken on it. The report primarily focused on the proactive monitoring undertaken by Facebook and Instagram.\nFacebook proactively removed 25 million items of spam, 2.5 million items of violent content, 1.8 million items relating to nudity and sexual activity and almost 600,000 items related to suicide and self-harm just in the one month between May 15 and June 15, 2021. Facebook’s proactive removal rate for these items was 99%, but only 37% for bullying and harassment, where it only proactively removed 118,000 items of content.\nInstagram on the other hand proactively removed almost 700,000 items relating to self-harm, 670,000 items of violent content, 490,000 items relating to nudity and sexual activity. Similar to Facebook, Instagram’s proactive removal rate for these items was 99%, but only 43% for bullying and harassment, where it only proactively removed 108,000 items of content.\nFacebook’s voluntary disclosures revealed that the Indian government issued 40,300 orders for information or takedown, relating to 62,754 Indian user accounts, during the period between July and December 2020. That’s an average of approximately 1000 orders per month. Facebook states that it provided some data to the government in at least half such orders.\nWhatsApp declared that it received a total of 345 complaints through its Grievance Officer, and that it only took action in 63 of such complaints. However, the abuse tackling part of the report, which states that it operates at three stages of an account’s lifestyle, i.e. (a) at registration; (b) during messaging; and (c) in response to negative feedback from other users, revealed that WhatsApp banned over 2 million accounts in one month! WhatsApp did not provide any information about legal demands from the Government, in relation to information or removals.\nGoogle’s mandatory compliance report reveals most of its user-related takedowns are for copyright, but the voluntary report reveals many police requests Google’s report provided information about complaints received and action taken in respect of its significant social media intermediaries operating in India. Since Google has argued before the Delhi High Court that Google.com is a search engine, and not a social media intermediary, the report likely primarily relates to YouTube. The report makes it clear that this is report only for compliance with the 2021 IT Rules, which requires the reporting of action taken on user complaints through the Grievance Officers. As a result, the report does not contain any information on government demands for removal. Google, does, however, publish a separate report in this regard.\nGoogle’s compliance report discloses that it received 27,762 removal requests from users in April 2021, of which 27,064 (97.5%) related to intellectual property rights, i.e. copyright and trademark. However, 99.99% of the content Google removed in response related to the copyright and trademark complaints, i.e. 59,322 out of 59,350). Google explains that more items were removed than complaints received, since a single complaint could include multiple items within it. There is no explanation, however, for why there are negligible statistics for complaints relating to YouTube’s content, harassment, impersonation, sexual violence etc.\nGoogle’s report regarding government demands reveals that it received almost 1000 removal orders from the government between July and December, 2020, relating to a total of nearly 7000 items of content. A breakdown of these requests showed that nearly 3/4ths of such orders came from the police. 95% of the content items ordered for removal were by the police and the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY). While the most number of complaints related to defamation (313 out of 990), the most content items flagged were for reasons of “national security” (2256 out of 7023).\nGoogle has taken the conservative, but misplaced view that Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 prohibits Google from disclosing any details about takedown requests from the Government. However, this is not correct, as there is no confidentiality requirement under S69A. The confidentiality requirement instead comes from Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules, 2009. However, that only applies to the complaint received by the appropriate government agency in respect of which it can order Google to take content down. Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules, 2009 does not apply to any takedown orders issued to Google by MeitY or the police. In fact, the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India in 2015 had held that where the originator of any information can be identified, they must be provided an opportunity to be heard before their content is removed.\nWhat can Big Tech include in the report to truly advance transparency? To be clear, strict compliance with the 2021 IT Rules only requires a numerical disclosure of the number of user complaints received and the action taken thereon. It requires no details of the complaints, no breakups relating to the categories of complaints received and action taken, and no disclosures regarding the source of these complaints. Most importantly, the 2021 IT Rules do not require a disclosure of how many content removals were ordered by the Government.\nHowever, in order to truly advance transparency in the digital life of Indians, it is absolutely crucial that Big Tech discloses Government censorship action on their platforms. While there is no specific provision of law which requires them to publish these reports, there is also no provision of law which stops them from doing this.\nSome companies already voluntarily publish such reports. Other Big Tech companies ought to follow suit. Facebook and Twitter may consider publishing breakdowns of the requests by requester (police/MeitY/other) and reasons (defamation/copyright/national security etc.) the way Google does. Google, on the other hand, may reconsider its interpretation of the confidentiality requirement under S.69A of the IT Act, and disclose more specifics of government requests.\nAll Big Tech companies must publicly disclose the government orders for takedown/information to truly champion transparency for the Indian users of the internet.\nImportant Documents  WhatsApp’s IT Rules compliance report (link) Google’s IT Rules compliance report (link) Facebook’s and Instagram’s IT Rules compliance report (link) Google’s government request report (link) Twitter’s transparency report (link) Facebook’s government request report (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/big-tech-releases-its-transparency-reports-in-compliance-with-the-it-rules-heres-what-we-found/","summary":"Google, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter have released their transparency reports in compliance with Rule 4(1)(d) of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the 2021 IT Rules).","title":"Big Tech releases its transparency reports in compliance with the IT Rules: Here’s what we found"},{"content":"            tl;dr The Ministry of Home Affairs, on July 14, 2021 issued a notification directing all law enforcement authorities to stop registering new cases under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and to immediately withdraw all pending cases. This was prompted and made possible by the application filed by PUCL - where IFF assisted. We hope that this will lay the zombie section to rest once and for all.\nMHA’s Notification On July 14, 2021, in a notification marked “Most Immediate: Supreme Court Matter”, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) directed Chief Secretaries and Director-Generals of Police of all states and union territories to direct all the police stations not to register cases under the repealed Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (S66A). The notification further directs that any cases that have already been registered must be immediately withdrawn.\n    The Notification also referred to our application before the Supreme Court which brought this issue to the MHA\u0026rsquo;s notice, and said that the “Hon’ble Supreme Court has taken a very serious view on the matter.”\nThe full notification can be accessed here.\n    PUCL’s application that led to the notification PUCL filed a Miscellaneous Application before the Hon’ble Supreme Court seeking additional directions to ensure compliance with the decision in Shreya Singhal v Union of India, which struck down S66A as unconstitutional (summary of the decision is here). IFF provided legal assistance to PUCL in drafting, filing and arguing the Application. In the Application, PUCL has referred to the findings on the Zombie Tracker and brought to the notice of the Supreme Court the ongoing cases where individuals are being tried under S.66A.\nWhile the sheer magnitude of the problem revealed by the data is shocking, some of the individual cases of prosecution are equally frightening. This includes the case of State v. Shekhar Rahul Nikam, RCC No. 1119/2018, pending before a Judicial Magistrate in Nashik. In this case, on 28.02.2020, charges were framed against the accused solely under S. 66A of the IT Act based on “offensive messages” sent in 2010.\nThere is also the even more shocking case of State v. Mohd. Sakir, Cr. Case No. 296349/2016 pending before a Magistrate at Tis Hazari Court, Delhi. In Mohd. Sakir, the FIR against the accused, is registered solely under S.66A, and at one of the hearings, the prosecutor even informed the Court that S.66A had been struck down by the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal. Yet, the magistrate issued a non-bailable warrant against the accused!\nAlmost 800 cases are currently pending - approximately 200 cases are added every year IFF, along with our friends at Civic Data Lab, developed the Zombie Tracker to track the extent of S.66A across the country. Since the data gathering was an exercise requiring high intensity of time, energy, labour and costs, it was restricted to 11 states of India. And even in these 11 states, the data that was found was staggering.\nA total of 1307 cases have been registered in the six years after the Supreme Court struck the section down. A fact that is even more shocking considering only 681 cases had been registered in the six years that S66A was on the statute books. This means that almost twice as many cases have been registered under S66A after it was declared illegal.\nAlmost 800 cases are presently pending under S66A. If the MHA’s Notification is strictly and effectively followed, then it will mean the closure of almost 800 cases that should never have been instituted in the first place. It will also mean the average of 200 new cases per year that are currently being instituted in these 11 states will be stopped.\nIt is also worth noting that the data is only available for 11 states, the true numbers are likely to be much greater than what we have available.

This will finally help implement the decision of the Supreme Court after six long years, and it will also bring much needed relief to the hundreds of Indians that are currently being harassed by an undead provision of law.\nWhile the MHA notification is one step towards that direction, PUCL in its application has also asked the court to:\n Direct Union of India through National Crime Records Bureau to collect data of cases where Section 66A has been invoked Direct Supreme Court registry to communicate to District Courts across the country to take cognizance of the judgment in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India in all proceedings where Section 66A has been invoked Direct Supreme Court registry to communicate to High Courts to collect data information from all the District Courts within its jurisdiction regarding pendency of cases under Section 66A at different stages and issue directions for due compliance of judgment in Shreya Singhal. Direct Union of India to publish in leading news papers informing the general public that Section 66A has been struck down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court  The next date of hearing in the Application filed by PUCL that led to this notification is on August 2, and we will be present before the Supreme Court to assist the bench in fully and effectively implementing its 2015 decision in Shreya Singhal.\nWe thank our legal team led by Senior Advocate Sanjay Parikh, Aparna Bhat (AoR), Karishma Maria, Sanjana Srikumar, Abhinav Sekhri, Vrinda Bhandari, Tanmay Singh, and Krishnesh Bapat.\nImportant Documents  MHA’s notification dated July 14, 2021 directing the closure of S.66A prosecutions (link) Previous blogpost dated July 5, 2021 titled “PUCL approaches Supreme Court seeking directions against continued prosecutions under the unconstitutional Section 66A” (link) Application filed by PUCL (link) Zombie Tracker (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/spooked-by-the-zombie-ministry-of-home-affairs-issues-notification-directing-all-s-66a-cases-to-stop/","summary":"Prompted by our application, the Ministry of Home Affairs, on July 14, 2021 issued a notification directing all law enforcement authorities to stop registering new cases under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and to immediately withdraw all pending cases.","title":"Spooked by the Zombie?

In this second post on our paper, we look at some of the key issues that plague the Health Data Management Policy, such as concerns about consent and confidentiality, data privacy and security, exclusion, and private sector access to health data.\nBackground Last month, we released our paper ‘Analysing the NDHM Health Data Management Policy’, that we had jointly written with the Centre for Health Equity, Law, and Policy. In our previous blogpost, we provided some context to the National Digital Health Mission’s (NDHM’s) Health Data Management Policy (HDMP), summarised our previous submissions on the policy, assessed India’s existing infrastructure in terms of the prerequisites needed for the implementation of a digital health records system, and looked at the governance framework laid down by the Policy.As we have pointed out earlier, it is welcome that the policy lays down privacy-by-design as its guiding principles. However, when one takes a more granular perspective, significant issues emerge with respect to the implementation of such ideals. In this blogpost, we will look at some of these issues.\nConsent and confidentiality The HDMP lays out a consent framework to govern the collecting, storing, processing and sharing of individual health data, with the objective that users “should at all times have control and decision-making power over the manner in which personal data associated with them is collected and processed further.” It also lays out the process for obtaining consent for collecting and processing of data, including in cases of children, mentally ill or incapacitated individuals, and medical emergencies. Lastly, the policy accords certain rights to users in relation to their medical data, including the right to confirmation and access, correction and erasure, restricting or objecting to disclosure, and data portability.\nFor the purpose of collecting and processing personal data, data processors are obligated to furnish a privacy notice and obtain the express consent of users. The consent must be:\n Freely and clearly given; Informed as to the scope of the consent; Specific as to the purposes of collecting or processing the data; Capable of being withdrawn at any time.  In the case of sensitive personal data, the data processor must also inform the user of any harms that may be involved in the processing of such data. Finally, the consent may be obtained on a physical paper or electronically, either directly from the user or through an electronic consent manager.\nThe NDHM-HDMP rightly centres user autonomy as its guiding principle. However, certain concerns remain. First, the mandatory requirement of taking informed consent is limited to the collection and processing of personal data, and the same requirement is not explicitly extended to the creation of a Universal health ID (UHID). Reportedly (see here and here), the central government is automatically generating UHID numbers for all individuals who choose to get COVID-19 vaccines by presenting their Aadhaar number, without the consent or knowledge of those individuals. This is at odds with the guiding principle of the HDMP’s consent framework.\nSecondly, the consent is required to be specific only as to the purpose for collecting and processing personal data. In effect, the health data companies can secure one-time consent of the users for collecting and processing personal data for one or more broad purposes. This is evident from the fact that companies are required to collect fresh consent only in the event of any change in its privacy policy or in relation to any previously unidentified purpose. Such a policy precludes the user from giving or refusing consent on specific lines.\nFor example, the user will not be able to withhold consent to digitise specific information or even refuse consent to share specific digitised information, such as abortion, substance use/dependence, HIV/STI status, suicide attempt and other mental illnesses. In order to address this, a broad consent in the beginning must be accompanied with specific consent taken at each instance of data processing and sharing. The specific consent must include the entity with whom information is to be shared, the specific purpose for sharing, and the information that is necessary to facilitate the purpose. To facilitate controlled sharing of personal data, data processors must be required to put in place systems and processes for ‘masking’ of data.\nThirdly, the NDHM Personal Data Processing Model Consent Form leaves out crucial information. The form must explicitly mentions that the collection of data is voluntary and refusal will not entail denial of services or care that one is entitled to or imposition of any additional cost. The exact duration of retention of the data must also be specified.\nFourthly, the consent framework can be further bolstered to empower users. For example, the broad consent form should be accompanied with an information sheet explaining the rights to confirmation and access, correction and erasure, restricting or objecting to disclosure and data portability, as well as the process for grievance redress, in an easy to understand language. Further, the consent should not be limited to a pre-printed form with blank spaces for limited handwritten entries and signatures, and should ideally be accompanied with online or in-person counselling.\nFinally, low digital literacy levels may impede the ability of users to exercise consent in an informed and meaningful manner. For example, a 2017-18 NSO survey found that only 18.4% of persons aged 15 and above were able to operate a computer, while only 22.9% were able to use the internet. Unfortunately, existing schemes for digital literacy have witnessed slow progress. For example, under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), as of March 2021, only around 4.54 crore candidates were enrolled for digital literacy training and 2.71 crore candidates were certified.\nA 2019 independent impact assessment of PMGDISHA indicated that:\n Only 50.53% of the respondents felt that their training had led to an increased confidence in the use of digital technology and a subsequent increase in earning capacity Only 37.63% of the respondents stated that they used digital technologies for daily office/school work; Only 30% of the respondents said that they were using the internet to access government services; Only 24.75% of respondents affirmed that they were able to teach digital skills to their family members after attending the program.  Additionally, many digital literacy programmes in India focus on the usage of computers, even though most of the country accesses the internet through mobile devices. In light of this, we recommend that the NDHM should facilitate and scale up digital literacy programmes in order to address problems associated with widespread digital illiteracy, which may impede the ability of data principals to choose and consent in an informed manner.\nData privacy and security\nThe HDMP states that its guiding principle is ‘Security and privacy by design’, and lays down a framework for realising the stated goal:\n Health data companies are bound by the principles of accountability, transparency, consent driven sharing, purpose limitation, collection, usage and storage limitation, and the adoption of reasonable security practices. Data minimisation must also be implemented. Companies must publish a ‘privacy by design’ policy. Additionally, they must conduct a data protection impact assessment, maintain reliable records, and submit to data audits.  While adopting ‘privacy by design’ as a principle is a step in the right direction, the overarching concern of large scale processing of health data in the absence of a data protection legislation remains. Without statutory backing, effective data protection would be difficult to enforce, especially since the HDMP does not contain adequate penalties for non-compliance as a deterrent. Additionally, concerns about surveillance remain unanswered.\nBesides, the policy itself does not imply a strong data protection regime. For example, the HDMP allows the processing of data till the purpose for which data was collected is no longer necessary, providing companies with the discretion to decide this. Additionally, the policy allows the blocking or restriction of personal data in case of impairment of the legitimate interests of either the user or the health data collector, which may allow the latter to store and/or process the user’s health data beyond the consented time-period and for longer than is necessary. Lastly, the HDMP allows for prohibitions against portability in case doing so would lead to the revealing of trade secrets. Now, compare this to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation: the right to data portability guaranteed under Article 20 of the GDPR does not impose such restrictions.\nThe HDMP also does not envisage a strong accountability mechanism to enforce privacy. For example, in case of breach of security, only notifying the NDHM has been mandated, whereas notifying the user has not been made compulsory! Meanwhile, the carte blanche given for the processing and usage of anonymised personal data as ‘non-personal’ data ignores several attendant security hazards. By contrast, the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research imposes strict conditions in order to prevent unauthorised access to data, including maintaining a list of authorised individuals with access to the data repository.\nThe policy also provides the NDHM with the discretionary power to specify acceptable purposes for collecting or processing health data, which may further contribute to excessive data collection. Such issues are further aggravated by the lack of adequate transparency and accountability measures that allow users the power to directly hold health data processors to account. Again, this can be addressed through strict access control requirements. As has been argued elsewhere, conflating privacy with security may lead to significant problems.\nTo combat these issues, robust access control mechanisms must be implemented:\n Both the regulator and the data processor can log all instances of access requests and approvals; Secure authorisation tokens are generated and authenticated for each approval; Regular cross-verification of access logs between regulators and processors occurs. Finally, only aggregated data should be stored at the cloud level, with individual electronic health records remaining at the facility level.  Inclusion Prima facie, the HDMP does address issues of exclusion: the policy explicitly lays down a regime of non-exclusion, with respect to both the possession of a health ID and Aadhaar-based verification. It mandates that participation in the National Digital Health Ecosystem shall take place on a voluntary basis, and that no individual can be denied access to any health service for lack of a Health ID. Additionally, Aadhaar will not be mandatory for registering for a Health ID, while each data principal shall have the right to opt out of the programme at any time and ask for the de-linking and deletion of their data.\nHowever, whether deliberate or not, the potential for both exclusion and coercion based inclusion still exists. India has already faced several issues with Aadhaar based authentication. The efficacy of Aadhaar based registration for schemes has been studied in various contexts. One study for Aadhaar based verification in PDS shops found that the system is “rife with technical issues such as incomplete seeding of cardholder information, biometric failure and administrative gaps such as inadequate failure reporting and back-up systems”.\nIndeed, the CEO of UIDAI had noted that in 2018, authentication failure for government services was as high as 12%. For a crucial sector such as health, such errors may end up having significant ramifications for public health outcomes. Such concerns have already been voiced before: for example, with regards to the Mother and Child Tracking System launched in 2009, activists have pointed out the threat of the extraction of data becoming a precondition for the delivery of health services. The mandatory use of Aadhaar for creating Health IDs is also contrary to the Aadhaar Act post the Puttaswamy judgement of the Supreme Court, which states that Aadhaar can only be made mandatory for government benefits and schemes.\nFurthermore, it is unclear whether the proposed framework will be able to accommodate user consent in practice. Experts have stated that the registration for the health ID may be similar to Aadhaar based registration, in that it would be “‘voluntary’ on paper, but made mandatory by certain institutions, both government-owned and private”. Multiple media reports (see here and here) have mentioned cases in which the health ID has been made mandatory. More recently, as mentioned earlier, multiple media reports have mentioned that citizens who have enrolled in the COVID-19 vaccination programme have had their Health IDs created without their consent. This is done on the basis of the data entered by citizens and is linked to their Aadhaar, despite several clarifications from the government stating that Aadhaar is not mandatory for receiving a vaccine.\nConcerns about ‘coercion-based inclusion’ also persist. Multiple reports have highlighted the effectively coercive nature of Aadhaar, in which citizens are coerced into registering through the Aadhaar framework for the provision of services. This can also take the form of financial compulsions, especially in the context of healthcare, as can be seen in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). At AIIMS, if a patient provides their Aadhaar ID they can get the registration charges of Rs. 100 waived off. Such patients are then subsequently issued a Health ID. Thus, the health ID framework must be revisited. Even if the framework is to be retained, Aadhaar-based verification should be removed so as to ensure that issues related to privacy are at the very least partially addressed.\nPrivate sector access to healthcare data The HDMP allows health data companies to share health data with entities for purposes of research, which also include insurance and pharmaceutical companies. Research must not use personal health data in individual patient care and the authorization for granting access must not be vested in individual data processors. This is all the more important as a lot of “research” could actually be data mining for improving marketing strategies, sales and development of products; purposes far removed from the purposes for which individuals trusted providers with their sensitive health data.\nApart from aforementioned risks to privacy and data security, the use of aggregated health data by private commercial entities have a range of legal and ethical implications, including the potential for market abuse, unfair competition and lack of a level playing field. Digital health records may also be used by private entities to further their own commercial or private interest at the cost of the individuals and public interest. For example:\n An insurance company may use digital health records to profile and score individuals and offer individualised insurance contracts (as opposed to risk pooling) and premiums that could lead to denial of coverage for high risk individuals and volatility in premium amounts for others depending on their health data. Profiling and individualisation may raise social concerns, in particular if the risk is correlated with low income and low wealth. This would undermine fairness and result in exclusions and discirmianiton against individuals or groups that would need insurance coverage the most. Pharmaceutical companies may use digital health records for targeted marketing to doctors and patients for their products, which may violate regulations on direct drug promotion. In jurisdictions where digitization of health records has been operational for years, the pharmaceutical companies have been using electronic health records as marketing tools with the physicians at the point of care. This has a huge impact on patient choice and safety and expenditure on drugs. In fact, some pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic centres may even be forming EHR vendor relationships and even investing in EHR softwares to push for their products. Data dredging is another very common occurrence that takes place in the pharmaceutical industry. It involves conducting multiple analyses till one arrives at the result “so hoped for” and the same is reported without truthfully conveying the analytical course undertaken.  Thus, the NDHM-HDMP should clearly specify that the purposes for sharing health data should be limited to medical and public health research purposes, as well as expressly prohibit sharing of such data for insurance and other commercial purposes. As a reminder, the Digital Information Security in Healthcare Bill, 2018 that had been placed in the public domain some time ago had specifically barred monetisation of health data and sharing of identifiable or anonymised health data with insurance companies (save for settling insurance claims), pharmaceutical companies, employers and human resource consultants. The technical processes and anonymisation protocols to be used for anonymisation should also be formulated and approved prior to implementation of the HDMP.\nImportant Documents  The National Digital Health Mission’s Health Data Management Policy (link) IFF and C-HELP Working Paper: ‘Analysing the NDHM Health Data Management Policy’ (link) Previous blogpost dated June 17, 2021 titled “Analysing the NDHM’s Health Data Management Policy: Part 1” (link)  We would like to once again thank the Centre for Health Equity, Law, and Policy for all their help and support on this paper.

In the past, we’ve covered the effects of the Bill on worker surveillance and agricultural data. In this post, we examine the Bill in relation to healthcare data. We explore the need to secure such data as well as why private companies and foreign hackers are interested in the data of senior citizens.\nBackground Last week, in the third post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we looked at social media user rights under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. We took a deep dive into the merits and demerits of the Bill when it comes to the common person and data fiduciaries. Users of any social media platform who are direct stakeholders of their own data must have greater say and better protection in this increasingly digital world.\nThis post continues to discuss how different groups of people are affected by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.This week, we’re taking a look at why there is an increasing interest in healthcare data and medical records and whether the Bill adequately protects such data. In the past, we have discussed privacy-related concerns in healthcare through our explainer on the Unique Health Identifier Rules and our analysis of the National Digital Health Mission’s health Data Management Policy.\nThe issue In a world where everything is becoming increasingly digital, each industry is facing a unique set of challenges that come with digitization. As such, in the health sector, digital technologies are being deployed for overcoming inefficiencies, ensuring better utilization of available resources, delivering certain services and follow-up, etc, for faster data collection. In a country with more than one billion people, any sort of data is bound to be scattered, even more so when it comes to healthcare data. As these records and databases transition to an online setting, healthcare organizations face an uphill challenge to protect this data. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, between 2009 and 2020, 3,705 healthcare data breaches of 500 or more records have been reported.\nTo understand why there is an increased interest in healthcare data, we must first understand what exactly is healthcare data? As per the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), health data can be classified into the following categories:\n Personal health data – data related to an individual containing detailed information of various health conditions and treatments. It includes any data with personally identifiable information of various stakeholders, such as healthcare professionals; and Non-personal health data – includes aggregate health data and anonymised health data where all personally identifiable information has been removed.  Why is it then, that the value of medical records on the web surpasses that of social security and credit card numbers? According to Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer of Carbon Black, “Health information is a treasure trove for criminals. By compromising it, by stealing it, by having it sold, you have 7 to 10 personal identifying characteristics of an individual.” A lot of healthcare data is sensitive personal data. Not only is this data sensitive, but it is also of great value to brokers who sell this data to private agencies and researchers. This is clearly evidenced by one of the largest Indian healthcare data breaches in 2019 when cyber criminals had stolen 68 lakh records of patient and doctor information. This breach contained Personally Identifiable Information (PII). According to another report, over 41.4 million patient records were breached worldwide in 2020 alone. This has alarming consequences.\nA number of things can happen with stolen healthcare data. Traditional criminals may resort to coercion and extortion by using your information. Others may commit identity theft. One of the most common places your data may eventually end up, however, is at insurance companies. In fact, hospitals in the US regularly sell medical information to data mining companies who then aggregate the data and resell it to private practitioners, insurance companies, etc. While both secondary use and sale of medical data are anonymised beforehand, several reports have revealed the possibility of identifying people even based on such disparate information. Such practices can result in an increase in insurance premiums and targeted advertising, leaving very little control over such sensitive information with the patient themselves.\nIn the absence of stringent data protection regulations, your parents’ and grandparents’ data can end up with foreign researchers or helping insurance companies profit.\nThe PDP Bill and Health Data Under section 3(21) of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB), ‘health data’ is the ‘data related to the state of physical or mental health of the data principal and includes records regarding the past, present or future state of the health of such data principal, data collected in the course of registration for, or provision of health services, data associating the data principal to the provision of specific health services’. Further, under section 3(36) of PDP 2019, ‘sensitive personal data’ refers to personal data that may reveal, be related to, or constitute health data, among others. At present, the Bill is silent on non-personal and anonymized data. As we have written extensively earlier, protecting personal data alone solves only half of the problem - non-personal data needs to be thoroughly regulated as well. In today’s world, it is nearly impossible for everyday users of the internet to achieve true anonymity. Indeed, many studies have already shown how anonymised data can be de-anonymised and used to identify individuals (see here and here).\nFurthermore, the Bill fails to adequately safeguard data of any sort in the case of data breaches. Clause 25 which deals with the breach of personal data states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary must inform the Data Protection Authority. However, the clause does not require the data fiduciary to inform the data principal (in this case, users whose healthcare data is now public). It is instead left to the Authority to decide: a) whether the data fiduciary must inform the data principal, b) the remedial action the data fiduciary must undertake, and c) the details of the data breach that can be made public. Moreover, there are no penalties imposed on the data fiduciaries in the event of a data breach. Given that the systems the digital healthcare industry rely on are already severely vulnerable to cyber attacks, the lack of penalties disincentivises enterprises from adopting more robust security standards..\nSolution To remedy some of the aforementioned issues, here are our recommendations:\n Clearly identifying the need, purpose, and safeguards for healthcare data: It has been argued that since the medical community is still divided over the impact of digital health records on clinical outcomes, there is a need to comprehensively study the same in the context of efficacy and privacy concerns. Lessons from studies from other countries may also be beneficial. For example, a survey of general physicians in Australia found that they accessed only a tiny fraction of all the reports uploaded onto the database. To this extent, the government must also hold consultations with diverse stakeholders to calibrate this framework towards a focus on improving medical outcomes (rather than on data collection). Hence, a transparent, consultative approach with public health groups, independent academics, and experts, digital rights organisations needs to be conducted on priority. Protect Non-Personal Data: Allow non-personal and anonymized data to be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for non-personal data. Strengthen the security framework: Companies must provide users with explanation of security practices and safeguards that their data will be subject to. Additionally, in case of a breach or hack, users must be informed about the incident and give details about the extent to which their data has been affected.

The bench has made important observations of powers of legislatures, parliamentary privileges, and the power Facebook wields in India.\nContext In February, 2020 Delhi witnessed widespread communal riots. On 2nd March, 2020, in the wake of these riots, the Legislative Assembly of Delhi constituted a Committee on Peace and Harmony (“the Peace and Harmony Committee/the Committee”) under the chairmanship of Mr Raghav Chadha. One of the objectives of the Peace and Harmony Committee is to understand the factors which caused riots and provide recommendations to ensure such riots do not happen again. After the Peace and Harmony Committee’s constitution, it received complaints which suggested that the Facebook platform had been used to endanger communal harmony. Thereafter, on 14th August, 2020 an article published in Wall Street Journal titled “Facebook’s Hate Speech Rules Collide with Indian Politics” presented a journalistic investigation into the role of officials at Facebook India who applied content moderation policies in a partisan manner enabling hate speech.\nIn this context, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology (“Parliamentary Committee”) and the Peace and Harmony Committee issued separate summons requesting Mr Ajit Mohan, Vice President and Managing Director of Facebook India Online Services Private Limited, to appear before them. While Mr Mohan appeared before the Parliamentary Committee, he refused to appear before the Peace and Harmony Committee on the ground that the regulation of intermediaries like Facebook squarely fell within the legislative domain of the Parliament (as opposed to Delhi Assembly). Upon the refusal, the Peace and Harmony Committee replied with another summon asking Mr Mohan to appear before them and stated that his refusal was inconsistent with the law of privileges of all legislatures. The law of privileges of a legislature, which is stated in the constitution (Articles 105 and 194), enables legislative assemblies and the parliament to initiate proceedings against those who hinder their functioning.\nIn response, Mr Ajit Mohan filed a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution before the Supreme Court of India. In the petition, Mr Mohan asked the Court to set aside the summons issued by the Peace and Harmony Committee. While the proceedings before the Court were pending, the Peace and Harmony Committee issued another summon, this time addressed to Facebook India. In the summons, the Committee requested that a competent senior representative of Facebook India appear before them. This summons was issued in supersession of the two summons issued to Mr Mohan and it substituted those summons as the subject matter of the proceedings before the Supreme Court.\nBroadly, there were two issues before the Supreme Court.\n Whether the Peace and Harmony Committee established by the Delhi Assembly could summon a non-member and threaten them with breach of privilege even though they had not intruded on the functioning of the Assembly? Whether the Peace and Harmony Committee established by the Delhi Assembly could compel executives of Facebook to appear as a witness even though the Assembly may lack competence to enact laws on regulating intermediaries such as Facebook?  The Judgment On 8th July, 2021 Supreme Court’s bench consisting of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari, and Hrishikesh Roy pronounced their judgment on the writ petition filed by Mr Mohan. The Court rejected Mr Mohan’s (and Facebook India’s) contentions that the Peace and Harmony Committee could not summon a non-member and investigate an issue on which it lacked the power to enact laws. The premise of the Court’s decision was that the function of a legislature is not restricted to enacting laws. The Court noted Walter Bagehot’s seminal work “the English Constitution” where he elucidated five significant functions of the legislature - elective, expressive, teaching, informing and finally, legislative. Thus, the court held that the function of the Delhi Assembly and thereby, the Committee is wider than enacting laws, hence, they could conduct an inquisition into the events leading to the Delhi riots. To that end, the Peace and Harmony Committee was justified in summoning executives of Facebook.\nMr Rahul Narayan has made a similar argument here where he has stated that:\n “politically, the Assembly is the voice of the people of a State and their discussions are an expression of popular will. Atomic energy is the exclusive preserve of the Union. Does that mean a State Assembly cannot inquire into the possible ecological implications of a nuclear waste site within the State?”\n The Court also noted that the concerns of Mr Mohan and Facebook India were premature since Peace and Harmony the Committee had only summoned them and had not even asked them to show cause for breach of privilege.\nAt the same time, the Court also held that the Peace and Harmony Committee could not recommend actions against persons against whom incriminating evidence is found because it wasn’t within the powers of the Assembly. The Court noted that recommending actions against persons was akin to ‘policing’ which was within the remit of the Union Government in National Capital Territory of Delhi. Thus, representatives of Facebook can refuse to answer questions posed by the Committee which are strictly within the domain of the Central Government.\nObservations on Facebook The judgment is noteworthy for chronicling the powers of the legislature. But the judgment also makes several crucial observations on how Facebook functions and the power Facebook wields in India. The Court noted that:\n “while Facebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and means to escape state censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices and ideologies.” (Paragraph 2)\n The Court questioned whether Facebook is merely an intermediary when it stated it is “difficult to accept the simplistic approach adopted by Facebook - that it is merely a platform posting third party information and has no role in generating, controlling or modulating that information” (Paragraph 4). The Court used the same line of reasoning in rejecting Facebook’s contention that its non-appearance would not disrupt the functioning of the Committee, and thus will not constitute breach of privilege. The Court observed that the:\n “petitioners, more so with their expanded role as an intermediary, can hardly contend that they have some exceptional privilege to abstain from appearing before a committee duly constituted by the Assembly.” (Paragraph 167).\n Apart from this, the Court was also critical of Facebook’s conduct in other countries. The Court stated that:\n “internationally, Facebook has had to recognise its role in failing to prevent division and incitement of offline violence in the context of the stated ethnic cleansing in Myanmar where a crescendo of misinformation and posts, somehow missed by Facebook employees, helped fuel the violence. The platform similarly apologised for its lack of serious response to evident signs of abuse of the platform in Sri Lanka, which again is stated to have stoked widespread violence in 2018 in the country and had to acknowledge its need to be regulated though the exact method is still unclear and a prerogative of law making authority.” (Paragraph 7)\n Conclusion The decision of the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court is welcome. In 2020, the Committee began a much-needed inquiry into the events that led to the Delhi riots. The Court’s decision allows the Committee to continue working in that direction. Importantly, the Committee is not restricted from evaluating the role of Facebook in the riots. The findings reported in the earlier mentioned Wall Street Journal article necessitated an inquiry into whether Facebook intentionally enabled the spread of hate speech on its platform. Previously, on 17th August 2020 IFF had sent a representation to the Parliamentary Committee asking them to summon Facebook’s senior management. As mentioned earlier, the Parliamentary Committee did summon Mr Mohan who duly appeared. We are glad that the Delhi Assembly can also conduct a similar exercise.\nImportant Documents  Judgment of the Supreme Court in Ajit Mohan \u0026amp; Ors. vs Legislative Assembly National Capital Territory of Delhi \u0026amp; Ors.

We are frequently approached by users of various social media platforms, asking what can be done if one’s account is blocked. We have prepared a step by step explainer to navigate situations of arbitrary account blockings and to gear you up in the fight to protect our freedom of speech and expression.\nBackground Free Speech is a constitutional guarantee we all are entitled to as citizens of a democratic state. However, this is not an absolute right. While Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution recognizes that freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right for every Indian citizen, Article 19(2) limits this right to “reasonable restrictions”. It is this vague verbiage that has often fuelled overbroad state interferences on free speech and arbitrary gag orders in the pretext of safeguarding “national interest.” In recent times, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp have emerged as the most common portal for mobilising the opinions and views of a diverse demography all over the world. Yet, we are witnessing an unprecedented scale of clampdowns on social media where arbitrary censorship of online speech is increasingly being directed against any voice of dissent. Twitter officials state that they have observed a steep rise in the orders passed by the government directing them to block specific accounts on their platform over the past year. From an estimated 3600 in all of 2019 to 9800 in 2020 to almost 6000 within the first six months of 2021, the government takedown orders to Twitter have more than doubled in the recent past with orders being largely arbitrary and discriminatory.\nIn March 2021, in response to an RTI application filed by Internet Freedom Foundation, the Department of Telecommunications informed us that “94 blocking orders were issued by DoT during 2020 \u0026amp; 2021 pursuant to orders of different Hon\u0026rsquo;ble courts and 3725 website/URL blocked or access disabled pursuant to these orders.” This is extremely worrying since social media platforms have penetrated almost every facet of our lives. Excessive and arbitrary restrictions on online speech under the garb of combating the spread of “fake news” and misinformation ends up causing a “chilling effect” on free speech which then undermines the values upheld by the Supreme Court of India in Shreya Singhal V. Union of India (2015) __ 5 SCC 1.\nFurther, even social media platforms are guilty of arbitrary account blockings purportedly as per the standards set out in their respective policies and guidelines but they largely lack accountability and transparency as upheld by the Santa Clara Principles.\nWhen can your accounts be blocked? Online content may be abridged or access disabled according to the legal provisions and internal policies of social media platforms as discussed below:\n Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 allows the Central Government to issue directions to any network provider to block public access to any content online when it is satisfied with the necessity of such an order. Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking For Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 delineate the process and powers of the Central Government to direct social media platforms to block specific online content. Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 obligates social media platforms to remove within thirty six hours any given information from their “computer resources” upon receiving such directions from any government agencies or orders from any competent court. On account of non-compliance, social media platforms stand to lose their “safety harbour” against criminal liability that section 79 of the Information Technology Act confers upon them. Privacy policies and Community Guidelines of the respective social media platforms list down specific instances wherein they disable access to accounts or remove content if any violation is reported. While the particular instances may differ for different social media platforms, the broad categories revolve around potential harms to the human rights of the users.  What can you do if your account is blocked? Twitter: If your account is blocked or you receive a warning notice regarding any blocking orders, you can write to Twitter’s designated officer indicating your grievance. Under the IT Rules, 2021 Twitter is bound to acknowledge your grievance within 24 hours, and take action on it in 15 days. In the event that no such communication has been corresponded to you, you may raise your grievance by filling out this form.\nFacebook: Facebook’s policies reveal that they preserve some of the user information for the purposes of compliance with requests and orders from law enforcement bodies as per their standard protocols. This becomes difficult to trace as not always are notices issued to the user. However, Facebook enables users to directly get in touch with the grievance redressal team to report or resolve an issue through its help centre. You may also raise your grievance directly with the resident grievance officer in India.\nInstagram: Instagram enables you to raise a complaint through an in-app redressal centre, in the event of your account being blocked or content restricted. If no action is initiated upon your complaint within the stipulated time under the IT Rules 2021, you may raise your grievance with the resident grievance officer in India.\nYoutube: Youtube facilitates users to raise a complaint with the reporting and intelligence desk through these webforms. You may also raise your grievance with Google, Youtube’s parent company’s resident team in India.\nWhat legal recourse should you take in case your grievances are not resolved by the social media platform? The IT Rules 2021 mandates that platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube et al. must respond to any grievance that you raise within 24 hours of receiving a complaint and resolve the issue within 15 days. However, on the account of the vague and arbitrary grounds for account blockings, the process of grievance redressal does get delayed. In that case, you may also file a RTI application with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting through the online portal, seeking information regarding why your account has been restricted. You may also choose to send a legal notice to the platforms challenging the blocking and demanding your account be restored without delay.\nWith the mission to safeguard your digital freedom, IFF supports users to resolve issues of account blocking in a twofold manner:\n Public transparency capacity: We assist in filing RTI applications, drafting and sending legal notices and representations to the concerned authorities to probe into the nature of account blocking and advocate for safeguarding the digital rights of our community. Strategic Litigation: IFF through its team of lawyers and pro-bono counsels provide direct litigation support to litigants challenging arbitrary blocking and censorship of free speech in various courts in India.

However, it is far removed from the modern technological realities and necessitates a reboot to reassess the social impacts of digitisation and to make sure that the governance framework is based on rule of law and protects the fundamental rights of the people. We wrote to the Parliamentary Standing Committee urging them to include the revision of the IT Act in its agenda for the upcoming parliamentary session.\nBackground Conceived as a legislation to regulate the paradigm shift in the IT ecosystem, the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) oversees almost every facet of online activities. Yet, the rapid transformation of the digital space in recent times has rendered even this legislation inadequate and inappropriate on several counts. In January 2021, we came across reports which highlighted the Government’s plans to update the IT Act. On February 3rd an answer to a Lok Sabha question stated that “MeitY has initiated work on amendment to the Information Technology Act, 2000 which, inter alia, includes strengthening the provisions for intermediaries for making them more responsive and accountable to Indian users.” Furthermore, in response to our RTI application, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) informed us that discussions with relevant stakeholders have begun regarding revamping the Act. On this basis, we wrote to MEITY on 16th February, emphasizing how the overarching framework of the Act required significant updating in light of several policy and legal developments that have taken place since its enactment and recommended that extensive public consultations be held to usher in the necessary changes.\nSince then, this issue seems to have gone under the radar. However, as Parliament returns to session and Parliamentary committees return to full functioning, We believe this is an apt time to once again consider potential pathways for the future of the IT Act. 21 years ago, the Act was promulgated to govern e-commerce in India, and define penalties therein. However, in the milieu of burgeoning social media platforms, and in light of the dynamic complications that come with the exponential growth in technology, the current regulatory framework falls short. Such complications include the collection of personal data, the right to privacy of users, freedom of speech and expression, and surveillance of citizens.\nHence, while the Act is currently the primary facilitator in terms of the law on e-commerce and e-governance, tailoring the Act to also address human rights issues with technology is welcomed. With the absence of applying a rights-friendly approach to the IT Act, neither is it possible to successfully achieve the distant dream of reasonable e-governance nor does it create an effective legal mechanism to safeguard the fundamental rights of citizens in the digital age.\nThus, this may be an opportune time for the Parliamentary Standing Committee to take up the task of considering updates to the IT Act in order to enable the Act to be an effective enactment in the contemporary context. Since the Act was last amended in 2008, the ubiquity and intricacies of technology have grown exponentially. Subsequent amendments and corresponding Rules have largely failed to respond to such changes appropriately, resulting in either excessive restrictions on free speech and mass surveillance or inadequate regulations against cybercrimes like data breaches, disinformation or malware attacks.\nHere, we highlight some of the main issues with the Act and draw attention to some of the key areas that require a ‘reboot’.\nOutdated provisions which fail to safeguard the right to privacy of the people The ever-expanding scope of technology with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has made it expedient for the regulatory framework to be more specific and effective which a 21-year-old legislation is unable to adequately capture. Not only do the provisions lack a defined data storage policy but also the metric for data retention do not adhere to the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation.\nFurther, section 76 facilitates confiscation of an impugned computer resource by the authorities without delineating safeguards against any potential loss or tampering of data, further enhancing the risks of data breach and false implications. Even the penal framework defined under sections 65 and 66 are limited to the tampering of “computer source code” and prove to be inadequate defences against AI fuelled attacks as was evident in the 2019 Pegasus software attack. Further, This magnifies the threat to the right to privacy as envisioned by the honourable Supreme Court in the KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1 judgment.\nVague and arbitrary provisions which lead to a chilling effect on free speech The regulatory framework of the IT Act suffers from vagueness and is susceptible to engendering excessive restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression. In the context of the emergent and expansive uses of social media platforms, arbitrary regulations can assert a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression. Be it the power to retain the information or intercept the data to trace the originator under section 7 or the obligation to provide access to computer data to the authorities under section 29, ambiguous vocabulary like “reasonable cause” or “satisfaction of the controller” creates an overreach of state censorship and promotes mass surveillance.\nMoreover, sections 69 and 69A empower the authorities to intercept computer resources and issue blocking orders to network providers in the “interest of sovereignty and integrity of India”. These categories are overbroad and fail to strike a proper balance between the freedom of speech and proportional social control. Similarly, under section 79, network providers stand to lose their ‘safe harbour’ on failing to conduct “due diligence” or to remove “unlawful” content”. Here again, the provisions preclude a conclusive understanding of such requirements and fostered unwarranted restrictions on the fundamental rights as is evident from the recent bans on social media accounts. This largely defies the observations of the honourable Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015) 5 SCC 1 and undermines the Santa Clara Principles.\nInadequate measures for data breaches Another significant concern is the increasing number of data breaches that have plagued the country. The average data breach in India in 2020 cost Rs 14 crore an increase of 9.4% from 2019. The per-unit data cost increased by 10% to Rs 5,522. The report also noted that the average time to both detect and contain a breach went up from 221 days to 230 days and from 77 to 83 days respectively. This indicates a significant amount of information and data loss for users.\nExisting mechanisms under the IT Act may be inadequate. For example, section 43A of the Act only provides compensation to users for negligent handling of sensitive personal data (and so not in the case of a breach of personal data). The use of such a narrow metric precludes any compensation for the vast amounts of data (such as a home address, passport details, etc) that have been leaked. Furthermore, no proactive measures for ensuring the security of data have been specified.\nRecommendations The IT Act serves as the de facto framework for digital governance in India. However, the fact of the matter is that it was enacted in 2000. For context, only 0.5% of the population (around 55 lakh people at that time) actually used the internet in 2000. BSNL was also incorporated 4 months after the passing of the Act. Clearly, there is a dire need to update the Act to reflect policy and legal developments as well as modern technological realities.\nIn addition, it is necessary to provide statutory measures for data security through the IT Act, 2000. A framework for determining liability and penalties with respect to data breaches and statutory measures for data security is recommended. This may be complemented by strengthening the powers of the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team to ensure proactive action against data breaches.\nAs we have detailed above, such an endeavour is of paramount importance and requires great scrutiny. It would involve examining the Act from multifarious perspectives and with respect to various issues, while ensuring that any forthcoming governance framework is constituted within the rule of law and duly safeguards the fundamental rights of the people. Given that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has expertise in the matters of digital technology (especially its governance), we believe it is important that the Committee take up this issue for consideration and add it to its agenda (the present list of subjects does not include a discussion on the IT Act).\nImportant Documents  IFF’s letter to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology regarding ‘Updating the Information Technology Act, 2000 as a probable issue for consideration’ (link) Previous blogpost ‘The Times Are A-Changing: Ensuring IT Act amendments are progressive’ dated 16th February, 2021 (link) IFF’s Letter to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology regarding , ‘Potential amendments to the Information Technology Act, 2000’ (link) Response to RTI request to MeitY, dated February 4th, 2021 (link)  We were assisted in the drafting of this blogpost by Deepika Nandagudi Srinivasa who is a fourth-year law student at the National Law University and Judicial Academy, Assam.\n      ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/update-the-it-act-2000-india-needs-a-reboot/","summary":"The Information Technology Act, 2000 is the the de facto framework for digital governance in India.

This included new ministers for MEITY, MOC, and MIB. We wrote to the new ministers, welcoming them to their new role and highlighting key areas that need to be addressed.\nBackground On Wednesday, 7th July, the Union Cabinet witnessed a reshuffle, with numerous new Ministers being initiated into the Cabinet and various portfolios being reallocated. Amidst all this churning, two appointments stand out for us:\n Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology \u0026amp; Ministry of Communications: Ravi Shankar Prasad was replaced as the Minister for both these Ministries by Ashwini Vaishnaw. Ministry of Information and Broadcasting: Prakash Javadekar was replaced as the Minister of Information and Broadcasting by Anurag Thakur.  We welcome the new ministers. Digital technologies play a key part in the lives of everyday Indians, and so ensuring that the use of such technologies is geared towards the needs of citizens is an important task. This makes the job of the Ministry even more important.\nHowever, while the ministers may have changed, the underlying demands haven’t. Thus, we view this reshuffle more as a ‘refresh’. Now, if we look at the meaning of the word ‘refresh’ in the technical sense, then we see that what happens is that the system clears up completed and pending tasks, and updates itself to receive the latest information. We hope that with the introduction of the new ministers, something similar will happen in the functioning of the Ministries, especially with respect to the protection of digital rights and in addressing the current challenges.\nThus, we have written to the new ministers, offering our assistance on such matters and helping advance India’s digital revolution in a manner that enshrines fundamental constitutional rights at its core. Below, we delineate some of the core concerns and issues we believe the Ministries must pick up.\nThe Ministry of Communications The most pressing issues facing the new Minister for Communications are:\n Inadequate digital Infrastructure: While India’s internet penetration is improving, evidence from government reports suggests that the country has a long way to go before attaining universal internet penetration. For example, TRAI’s ‘The Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators October – December, 2020’ report states that India has 795.18 million internet subscribers, which indicates an internet penetration rate of only 58.51%. Rural-urban disparities prevail, as indicated the rural penetration rate of 34.69%, with 308.17 million rural internet subscribers, is not even one third of the urban penetration rate of 103.98%, with 487.01 million urban internet subscribers. Furthermore, given that around 37,439 villages in India are still not covered by telecom service providers, it is clear India’s digital infrastructure requires further expansion. Such measures must especially focus on under-serviced areas, for which better usage of the Universal Service Obligation Funds is imperative. Low digital literacy: Existing schemes for digital literacy have also witnessed slow progress. For example, the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMDISHA) has identified 4.54 crore target candidates, a low number for a country with a population like that of India. Out of these, only 2.71 crore candidates had been certified as of 17th March 2021. Thus, there is an urgent need to address the digital divide not only by expanding India’s digital infrastructure but also by focusing on comprehensive digital literacy. Routine Internet shutdowns by governments: Another significant issue is the prevalence of internet shutdowns. Between 2012 and 2019, the Indian government has shut down the internet in various parts of the country approximately 374 times, with 2019 and 2020 witnessing an estimated 106 and 129 shutdowns respectively - causing $2.4 billion in losses. India accounts for 70% of total global losses caused by internet shutdowns. This indicates that internet shutdowns are not being used as a last resort, and are instead deployed aggressively. Compliance with the honourable Supreme Court’s judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India is also low, as several internet shutdowns have been imposed without publishing the underlying orders and have even refused to provide this information in response to RTI application. The amendments to the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 also fail to promote active compliance. Thus, we urge the Ministry to enforce greater transparency and accountability in the blocking process, beginning by ensuring that shutdown orders are proactively published. Need to effectively implement net neutrality: Lastly, the regulation and enforcement of net neutrality is also in need of improvement. A recent study has shown that that the website blocklists of licensed internet service providers across India are widely inconsistent with one another, suggesting that a larger pattern wherein internet providers are either a) not complying with blocking orders under section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 or b) arbitrarily blocking websites without legal orders. Here too, compliance with the decision of the honourable Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin is low, as blocking orders issued under section 69A are not easily accessible. This is compounded by the lack of implementation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI’s) recommendations regarding ‘Traffic Management Practices and Multistakeholder Body for Net Neutrality’, leading to further regulatory confusion. Thus, it is important to address issues of net neutrality in line with the goals of the Secure India mission by operationalizing the recommendations of the TRAI.  The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology The most pressing issues facing the new Minister of Electronics and Information Technology are:\n Intermediary liability and the IT Rules: The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 have faced significant criticism on several grounds. While we understand the need for robust regulations and acknowledge the inclusion of certain progressive provisions, on the whole, the IT Rules are undemocratic, unconstitutional, and regressive. Thus, the IT Rules must be withdrawn. Till a broader and more comprehensive digital governance framework is implemented, intermediary liability can be regulated by the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011. Updating the IT Act: When the Information Technology Act, 2000 was originally passed, the aim of the Act was to govern e-commerce in India. However, the legislation does not address the dynamic complications that come with the exponential growth in technology. Thus, there is a need to draw up a comprehensive new framework for digital governance in India that takes into account the technological, policy, and legal developments that have taken place in the last few years. Thus, a process for updating the Information Technology Act, 2000 must be made public This would involve conducting large scale consultations with various stakeholders as well setting out a position paper on the future of the Act on the basis of inputs by technical and legal experts. Greater transparency with respect to content blocking: One of the key issues that the new framework must address is the lack of transparency with regards to content blocking orders issued under section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Often, orders are not made publicly available. In many cases even the originators of the content in question do not receive such a notice. By securing greater accountability in all such cases, the honourable Ministry can ensure a fuller expression of citizen’s fundamental right to the freedom of expression, and also foster greater public trust in the commitment of the Ministry to balance this freedom with the safety of Indians online. Curb data breaches: Another significant concern is the increasing number of data breaches that have plagued the country. The average data breach in India in 2020 cost Rs 14 crore an increase of 9.4% from 2019. The per-unit data cost increased by 10% to Rs 5,522. The report also noted that the average time to both detect and contain a breach went up from 221 days to 230 days and from 77 to 83 days respectively. This indicates a significant amount of information and data loss for users. Meanwhile, existing mechanisms under the IT Act may be inadequate, while no proactive measures for ensuring the security of data have been specified. Thus, it is necessary to provide statutory measures for data security and strengthen the powers of the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team to ensure proactive action against data breaches.  The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting The most pressing issues facing the new Minister of Information and Broadcasting are:\n Digital news media, OTT content, and the IT Rules: The IT Rules also grant administrative powers to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting have faced significant criticism. Currently, the Ministry is regulating such content under Part III of the IT Rules, which have been issued under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). However, the IT Rules in this regard are ultra vires their parent legislation, since the IT Act never contemplated digital news media platforms and over-the-top video streaming platforms at all, nor does it grant any powers to the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting.We urge that due to the injury to creativity, artistic freedom and the ability for the production of new age content the Ministry may consider withdrawing the IT Rules. As a second step, you may further consider commencing a broader exercise of public consultation within the purview of appropriate legislation. Press freedom: Recent media reports have spoken about rising attacks and threats on members of the press fraternity in response to their reportage, particularly in the online sphere. Such threats also include prosecutions under criminal law, including using archaic provisions of law such as sedition. Human Rights Watch in its 2021 report has noted that several journalists faced criminal cases for reporting on Covid-19, while PEN Canada’s Report on The Use of India’s Laws to Suppress Free Speech identified overbroad censorship law and oppressive prosecution procedures as some of the key issues. As a result, India has been facing a sharp downward curve in its press freedom rankings in recent years, and is currently Rank 142 in 2021. Thus, we have asked the Ministry to consider the possibility of enacting a law to protect journalists and engage with criminal law reforms presently being led.

Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from Government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information (RTI) Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from, the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of June , we have up till now filed 21 RTI requests, 2 First Appeal and 1 Second Appeal electronically with authorities at the Central level, concerning the various issues on which we engage with the Government.\nNote: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month\u0026rsquo;s report may be included in the present report.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 10 RTI requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:\n The Department of Military Affairs on use of Face Recognition Biometric Attendance System at the Dibrugarh office of the Department of Military Affairs. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences **** on the use of Face Recognition Biometric Attendance System at the AIIMS, New Delhi. The Indian Oil Corporation Limited on use of Face Recognition Biometric Attendance System at the Tirunelveli office of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited. The Ministry of Labour \u0026amp; Employment on the use of Face Recognition Biometric Attendance System at the Chandigarh office of the Ministry of Labour \u0026amp; Employment. The Department of Defence on the use of Face Recognition Biometric Attendance System by the Department Of Defence, Research \u0026amp; Development.  For more information on the use of facial recognition technology and how it increases mass surveillance, visit IFF’s Project Panoptic.\nAdditionally, we also filed requests with:\n The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare on the different MOUs signed between the GOI and Patanjali Organic Research Institute, Amazon Web Services (AWS), ESRI India Pvt. Ltd., Agribazar India Pvt. Ltd. The Central Board of Secondary Education **** regarding the breach of the data of students enrolled under CBSE as per reports titled New Scam?

The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology and Air India on IFF’s representation IFF/2021/030 dated June 11, 2021.  We also filed 1 second appeal with:\n The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre **** against their reply to our request regarding theiruse of Face Recognition Technology System.  Further, pursuant to the CIC order passed on May 17, 2021 in our second appeal regarding our RTI requests asking for information about surveillance orders that the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued in 2018, the First Appellate Authority held a telephonic hearing on June 24, 2021. We are awaiting a copy of the First Appellate Authority’s decision. IFF will consistently and incrementally be pushing for greater transparency and trust for interception and surveillance reforms. You can read more about the hearing and the CIC’s order here.\nNet Neutrality Through the SaveTheInternet campaign, we were able to secure a massive public victory for net neutrality in India. This resulted in legal rules which now require internet service providers and telecoms companies to treat all data equally. Protecting net neutrality in India is one of our most important campaigns. For this, we filed requests with:\n The Department of Electronics and Information Technology on our representation bearing reference no. IFF/2021/026 dated May 22, 2021.  Free Speech and Censorship Another focus of our work is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the last month, we have filed 10 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Department of Electronics and Information Technology, the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Home Affairs regarding the restriction of the Twitter account of Polis Project Inc. on April 22, April 29, May 4, May 13 and May 15, 2021. The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology, the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Home Affairs regarding the restriction of the account of Mr. Manjul Kishore on June 4, 2021.

In the past, we’ve covered the effects of the Bill on worker surveillance and agricultural data. In this post, we discuss whether the Bill actually protects user data - specifically when it comes to social media platforms. We examine the need for stronger data protection regulation in a world where data generation is increasing exponentially. We also cover why protecting personal data alone achieves little.\nBackground Last week, in the second post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we looked at agricultural data and farmers’ rights under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Specifically, we also discussed the Consultation Paper on IDEA by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation, and Family Welfare. In the lack of adequate consultation, consent, or representation, the proposed Agristack seemed to benefit the government and private corporations more than the farmers. Farmers who are direct stakeholders of their own data must have greater say and better protection.\nThis post continues to discuss how different groups of people are affected by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and so, for this week, we decided to look at social media users under the Bill. In the past, we have discussed user rights through our blog posts on user rights and voluntary social media verification. We have also detailed some essential features a rights-respecting data protection regulation must have. In this post, we will be taking a closer look at the extent to which the Personal Data Protection Bill protects user data in the content of social media platforms.\nThe issue In today’s world, our increased dependence on technology has fuelled data creation exponentially. Google now processes 40,000 search queries every second. According to DOMO’s ‘Data Never Sleeps’, every minute of the day - WhatsApp users share over 41 million messages, Instagram users post 300,000 stories, and LinkedIn users apply for over 69,000 jobs. The fact of the matter is that there’s an enormously high amount of data being generated every second merely by engaging with such platforms. While most companies collect user data for the purposes of targeted advertising or website management, the amount of personal and non-personal data they collect varies. In the absence of any data protection regulation, your data may most likely end up with anyone from a researcher to an advertiser to a foreign intelligence agency.\nThe Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 - soon to be India’s first data protection law is definitely a step in the right direction. The Bill intends to regulate the collection, usage, storage, and transmission of personal data of individuals (data principals) by the government and private companies (data fiduciaries). We’ve previously written about some of the essential features a rights-respecting data protection regulation must have.\nIn a data protection regime that claims to be rights-based, it is imperative that the users are given certain rights against the data fiduciaries. These rights are essential for the users to exercise control over their personal data. As detailed in our explainer on the Bill, Chapter V of the Bill grants users the Right to confirmation and access, the Right to correction and erasure, the Right to data portability, and the Right to be forgotten. Yet data fiduciaries can reject all of these requests if they choose to, and there are no mechanisms in place to contest their decision.\nHow well does the Bill really protect us when it comes to using social media platforms? Let us take a look at what the PDP Bill has to say about user data that is collected by data fiduciaries, who owns this data, and how it is shared.\nThe PDP Bill and Social Media Under the PDP Bill, a data fiduciary (including social media intermediaries) is required to obtain consent for collecting data under Section 7, and consent for processing under Section 11. While seeking consent (by providing notice to a data principal at the time of collection of personal data) under Section 7, a data fiduciary must state the purposes for which the personal data is to be processed under Section 7(1)(a), and inform a data principal about the individuals or entities including other data fiduciaries or data processors with whom such personal data may be shared under Section 7(1)(g). In this context, under Section 11(3), explicit consent is required for processing any sensitive personal data. Furthermore, a data principal must be made aware of the sharing of any personal/sensitive personal data with a third party through a notice under Section 7(1)(g). Thus, the Bill does a fair job at protecting users’ personal data.\nYet, the Bill could be greatly improved in the following regards:\n Ownership not clearly defined: The Bill is extremely vague in the ownership of user data. A model example is Brazil’s General Data Protection Law, 2018, which explicitly states “every natural person is assured ownership of his/her personal data”. The ambiguity in our Bill, however, creates great potential for misuse. Even if you have “nothing to hide”, your data may end up in the wrong hands without your knowledge. Non-personal and anonymized data is ignored: While the Bill largely applies to personal data, non-personal and anonymous data are exempted from the provisions meant to protect user data. The Central government can use Section 91 of the Bill to direct entities to share anonymized and non-personal data with it. In today’s world, it is nearly impossible for everyday users of the internet to achieve true anonymity. One of the landmark cases in deanonymization is this report on a 2008 Netflix dataset of users and their movie ratings - with just 8 movie ratings, 99% of records were uniquely identified in the dataset. Government access to data: Section 91 provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymized or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. The government is exempted from providing an objective for data collection and processing. The state-authorized data should be addressed in a more transparent and accountable way so that the class of persons getting affected from such processing could be given a reason or justification for the need for processing. We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data. Inadequate user rights: Lastly, the current Bill creates impediments to exercise the rights that the users do have. Data fiduciaries can reject user requests for “correction, completion, updation, or erasure” if they disagree with your requests, even though it involves your data. Furthermore, there is no means in place to contest the decision made by data fiduciaries if they reject your requests.  Solution To remedy the aforementioned issues, here are some of our recommendations:\n Renew User Rights: According to the first principle of the Indian Privacy Code, individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection. Therefore, the rights of users under the Bill have to be reviewed to ensure that the right to privacy of users gets primacy and the interests of data fiduciaries are addressed through limited exceptions. Inclusion and treatment of Social Media Intermediaries: The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people\u0026rsquo;s government-issued identity documents. This can lead to the aggregation of demographic information across companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. Protect Non-Personal Data: Allow non-personal and anonymized data to be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for non-personal data. Advocate for Data Minimisation: Data fiduciaries should not collect more data than they need. There needs to be a greater discussion on the kind of data companies require and their goals cannot compromise the basic privacy of people.  This is the third post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series on how the Personal Data Protection Bill will impact different facets of our life; you can read part 1 on worker surveillance here and part 2 on the Agristack here.

Our core suggestion is that all implementation with regards to the Agristack be halted till extensive consultations with farmers have been carried out. Beyond this, we have addressed issues of data localisation, federalism, data protection, user rights, the need for public investment, and the necessity of robust data standards.\nBackground On 4th December last year, we released an explainer on the project colloquially known as the Agristack. Since then, we have continued to engage with the issue:\n We have written a joint letter with 55 other organizations to the Ministry of Agriculture highlighting our concerns with the project. We have also analyzed the various MoUs signed by the Ministry with companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Patanjali regarding a pilot for the Agristack (see here and here). Last week, in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we looked at how the Personal Data protection Bill, 2019 would impact digital agriculture. Along with other organisations, we have jointly organised a public webinar on the Agristack.  The project has also begun to receive a significant amount of public attention, as several media organisations have begun to highlight the issues at hand:\n The lack of consultations with farmers and farmers’ organisations has been criticised. The potential threat of the erosion of privacy and data exploitation has been highlighted. Several reports (see here, here, and here) have discussed the fear of a ‘corporate takeover’ of agriculture. The danger of land grabs and exclusion (see here and here) that emerges from the linking of land records with Agristack has been pointed out. The lack of provisions for data protection and consent (see here and here) in the MoUs (that would provide private companies such as Microsoft and Amazon with unfettered access to farmers’ data) has been discussed. The larger political economy of this vision of ‘agri-digitisation’ has also been spoken about.  Now, in an answer to a Lok Sabha question on 9th March, 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture and farmers’ Welfare had stated that a task force has been constituted to develop the IndEA (India Enterprise Architecture) Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture (i.e. the Agristack), on the basis of which a Unified Farmers Service Platform will be prepared. On 1st June, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation \u0026amp; Farmers Welfare finally uploaded a consultation paper on the ‘India Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture’ (IDEA).\nWe have endorsed a submission by 90 other organisations (including several farmers’ organisations), highlighting several issues with the proposed framework for implementation of the Agristack. To complement this, we have also provided our own submission on the consultation paper. Here, we will explain our suggestions and comments on the consultation paper, as well as why we feel all progress on the Agristack must be halted till thorough consultations with farmers have been held.\nOur Suggestions All through the IDEA process, farmers have been left out of the policymaking process. When news emerged about the Agristack, farmers were not consulted. The composition of the Task Force for the development of a Centralised Farmers’ Database and creation of framework for Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture and the various Working Groups for the implementation of IDEA reflect the lack of farmer representation.\nEven the consultation paper has simply been uploaded onto the Ministry’s website. The paper itself is in English, and in very technical English at that. How can the vast swathes of farmers, who belong to rural areas and may not be able to understand English, be expected to effectively engage with the proposals contained therein? Furthermore, a period of only 30 days was provided to respond to the paper.\nThus, our core recommendation is that the implementation of IDEA be halted until large-scale consultations have been held with farmers and farmers’ organisations on both the vision and implementation of IDEA. The consultation paper should also be made available in vernacular languages as well, and the period for consultation must be extended. Additionally, academics, technologists, civil society and digital rights organisations must engage with the development of IDEA both as a policy framework and its execution proceeding from the concerns and experiences of farmers. This will require long term study and constant engagement through vernacular modes and implementation frameworks to assist better understanding emerging from farmers groups across the country.\nOur specific recommendations are the following:\n Need for Digital infrastructure and digital literacy programs: India is facing a significant digital divide. While India’s internet penetration is improving, evidence from government reports suggests that the country has a long way to go before attaining universal internet penetration. For example, TRAI data states that India has 795.18 million internet subscribers, which indicates an internet penetration rate of only 58.51%. Rural-urban disparities prevail, as indicated the rural penetration rate of 34.69%, with 308.17 million rural internet subscribers, is not even one third of the urban penetration rate of 103.98%, with 487.01 million urban internet subscribers. In such a context, given the massive rural-urban differences, farmers may not fully make use of the Agristack platform. Additionally, farmers may not understand the functioning of data collection processes, and so may be exploited into providing their data without their effective consent or without compensation. Thus, we recommend that the creation of digital infrastructure be ramped up on a mission mode basis. Additionally, the scale of digital literacy schemes must also be increased, while the quality of the training imparted must be improved. Localisation and federalism: A truly federated framework for IDEA should include key roles for district and block level entities. This would serve two key purposes. Firstly, given the asymmetries of power, information, and resources, the farmers, who may not be able to adequately access their data if stored in a central database elsewhere, would be truly able to engage and gain access to the data that has been collected from them. Secondly, this would also provide a significant economic base, as the demand for both manufacturing and human capacity for database processing and handling in rural areas Thus, we recommend that the paper incorporate data localisation as a central principle of the IDEA project and provide a significant role of local district level entities in the implementation of IDEA. Additionally, central assistance in agriculture must not be made conditional on the implementation of IDEA, and that large scale discussions be held with states to arrive at a consensus regarding the vision and implementation of IDEA. Robust data protection standards and the protection of user rights: The approach proposed by the paper does not seem to adequately address privacy concerns. For example, the framework may allow a certain amount of arbitrariness and laxity with respect to data protection standards among entities, resulting in an overall loss of security within the system. This is even more important given that IDEA may be implemented in the absence of robust data protection legislation (the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is yet to be passed). However, even once sufficient security standards have been prescribed, it is important that their locus and applicability is established. Thus, it is vital that stringent data standards are imposed upon all participating entities, and that a proactive approach to ensuring data protection is followed. Moreover, all agricultural data must be categorised as personal data, and it should be regulated as such. Lastly, standards of fair and true interoperability must be adopted, and service providers must not be given the option to deny portability requests. ****Need for public sector involvement: **** Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been touted a lot in recent years, but the success of the model is yet to be comprehensively demonstrated. Often, the private firms involved in PPPs have been unable to bear the regulatory burden and have led to long delays. The issue is that PPPs, despite what its proponents have said, have not been found to reduce costs or increase inefficiencies. In fact, it has been the opposite, as the cost of capital has been higher, delays have been more, and project failures needing failures are more frequent. Private interests also begin to dominate projects, and rent seeking behaviour increases leading to higher costs for the public exchequer and higher prices for consumers. Meanwhile, agriculture has seen a significant decline in public investment and resources. This has, as might have been expected, had a significant impact on Indian agriculture: the share of indebted cultivator households increased from 25.9% in 1992 to 45.9 in 2013. Alongside this, debt-asset ratios for rural households increased from 1.78 to 3.23 in the same period - an increase of more than 80%! Clearly, public investment is important for agriculture. In fact, public investment in agriculture is generally a spur for even higher private investment and also results in improved returns for private investment.Thus, we recommend that the implementation of IDEA be undertaken by the public sector. The government can then sell the right to operate in the IDEA ecosystem to potential private partners as license. This would also allow the government to effectively regulate the actions of the participating private entities and hold them accountable. Strong regulation for Agri Data Exchange: India’s agricultural datasets are plagued by incompleteness and inconsistencies, and so, to this extent, an Agricultural Data Exchange (ADEx) would help to clean up and organise this data. However, the reasons for the same need to be understood. For example, with respect to land records, these problems are due to fundamental issues in land record keeping, from centre - state disparities to the nature of land disputes to a lack of land titles. Resolving such problems in an adequate manner may involve time and patience, and so, as an example, the government should not speed up the land records digitisation process arbitrarily, as this may lead to dispossession and land grabs. Thus, we recommend that the ADEx be implemented with robust provisions to ensure the protection of user rights over data. However, in the rush to implement the ADEx, community concerns about the ownership of data must not be ignored. Currently, while valuable data is often aggregated, group, or anonymized data, the communities from whom the data is collected or to whom the data belongs are either not recognised as the community owners of that data or are not adequately compensated for the use of this data. Thus, public ownership of data is an issue of economic justice. Additionally, we recommend that farmers and farmer organisations be recognised as the owners of their data. This would imply that when participating entities use the farmer’s data, they must a) take the farmers’ explicit consent for the use of data and b) they must provide the farmers with compensation for the use of their data. When data is being collected from the farmers, data minimisation must be followed, and only that data which is necessary for the purpose it is being processed for must be collected. Lastly, the principle of data localisation must be adopted. Participating entities can then use this data, but they can only carry with them the insights gleaned from the processing of the data - the original data must stay with the local data centres. Regulatory sandbox must help facilitate compliance and not evade it: Given the large-scale changes that would result as a result of implementing IDEA, a regulatory sandbox may be helpful in testing services in a new environment. However, the approach must be one that allows potential entities to test whether they can provide services within the IDEA environment (with no laxity of standards) and allow them to gain insight as to potential challenges. Regulatory sandboxes have also been criticized for their use as an avenue to avoid compliance burdens. Consumer groups have raised questions about regulatory sandboxes, including the lack of public and consumer input, exemptions from liability for unfair or deceptive practices, and the lack of protection for consumers and users. In this context, it is important that potential participating entities be made to experience the IDEA environment as it would be implemented, so that any obstacles to compliance can be addressed, and entities get a better understanding of how the environment would operate, from both a consumer dynamics and a regulatory perspective. Thus, we recommend that the I-Box be implemented along the lines of the actual IDEA environment, and not as a tool of regulatory evasion.

PUCL has approached the Supreme Court seeking directions to ensure that individuals are not prosecuted under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, which the Supreme Court struck down in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India \u0026amp; Ors., (2015) 5 SCC 1. IFF provided legal assistance to PUCL in its application.\nBackground S. 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) criminalised “offensive speech” over the internet. This provision was used to suppress dissent across the political spectrum. In March 2015, the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India \u0026amp; Ors., (2015) 5 SCC 1 __ (Shreya Singhal) declared that the provision was void ab initio, i.e. was deemed never to have existed on the statute books as it violated Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution (summary).\nAs a result of this judgment, all pending cases should have been dismissed, and no new cases should have been instituted under S. 66A. However, in 2018 a research paper by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta demonstrated that Section 66A was being used to prosecute individuals all over the country.\nIn January 2019, taking note of the research paper, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), one of the original petitioners in Shreya Singhal, with assistance from IFF, approached the Supreme Court. PUCL sought directions from the Supreme Court to ensure implementation of the decision in Shreya Singhal. In February 2019, the Supreme Court directed the Union of India to ensure compliance with its decision by making available copies of the judgment to Chief Secretaries across the country. The Chief Secretaries, in turn, were directed to sensitise police departments across the country.\nIFF and CDL develop Zombie Tracker Despite the directions of the Supreme Court, we came across reports which showed that S. 66A was still being invoked in fresh cases and pending cases were not being dismissed. Therefore, in collaboration with Civic Data Labs (CDL), we built a platform - Zombie Tracker - to track cases which include a charge under S. 66A. The Zombie Tracker provides details of S. 66A cases registered between 27.10.2009 and 15.02.2020 (both ongoing and disposed of cases) in 11 states. Data generated from Zombie Tacker bolster our advocacy efforts to ensure such cases are dismissed, and fresh cases are not registered. As of 03.07.2021, our findings indicate that as many as 810 cases are pending before the district courts in 11 States.\nConcerned with continued enforcement of S. 66A, PUCL again approaches Supreme Court PUCL is one of the foremost civil liberties organisations in the country. They have filed several cases apart from the petition challenging the constitutionality of S.66A, which have led to landmark judgments that expanded human rights in India. Some of these landmark cases include Telephone tapping case (1997) 1 SCC 301, Fake police encounter in Manipur (1997) 3 SCC 463; Disclosure of criminal background and assets by political candidates, (2003) 9 SCC 490; Challenge to POTA (2004) 9 SCC 980; and Encounter killings in Maharashtra, (2014) 10 SCC 635.\nIn line with the continuation of their brave efforts to defend the civil liberties of Indians, PUCL filed a Miscellaneous Application before the Hon’ble Supreme Court seeking additional directions to ensure compliance with the decision in Shreya Singhal. IFF has provided legal assistance to PUCL in drafting the Application.\nIn the Application, PUCL has referred to the findings on the Zombie Tracker and brought to the notice of the Supreme Court the ongoing cases where individuals are being tried under S.66A. These cases include the case of State v. Shekhar Rahul Nikam, RCC No. 1119/2018, pending before a Judicial Magistrate in Nashik. In this case, on 28.02.2020, charges were framed against the accused solely under S. 66A of the IT Act based on “offensive messages” sent in 2010. PUCL has also referred to the even more shocking case of State v. Mohd. Sakir, Cr. Case No. 296349/2016 pending before a Magistrate at Tis Hazari Court, Delhi. In Mohd. Sakri, the FIR against the accused, is registered solely under S.66A, and at one of the hearings, the prosecutor even informed the Court that S.66A had been struck down by the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal. Yet, the magistrate issued a non-bailable warrant against the accused!\nTo prevent such continued enforcement of S.66A, PUCL has urged Supreme Court to - a) direct National Crime Records Bureau to collect data from across the country (district courts/high courts) regarding FIR’s and pending cases where S.66A has been invoked; b) direct the Supreme Court Registry to inform all district courts throughout the country to take cognizance of the decision in Shreya Singhal in all proceedings where S.66A has been invoked; c) direct the Supreme Court Registry to communicate to High Court’s to collect information from all District Courts regarding the pendency of cases under S.66A within their jurisdiction and issue directions for compliance with Shreya Singhal; d) direct Union of India to issue advisory to all police stations not to register cases under S.66A; and e) direct Union of India to publish in leading newspapers informing the general public that S.66A has been struck down.\nSupreme Court hears PUCL’s Application PUCL’s application came up for hearing before a three-judge Supreme Court bench consisting of Justice Nariman, Justice Joseph and Justice Gavai. The bench was pleased to issue notice on the application and directed the Union of India to file a reply within two weeks.\nPUCL was represented by Senior Advocate Sanjay Parikh, Aparna Bhat, Karishma Maria, Sanjana Srikumar, Abhinav Sekhri, Vrinda Bhandari, Tanmay Singh and Krishnesh Bapat. The Union of India was represented by the Attorney General for India, Mr K.K Venugopal.\nWe thank PUCL for granting us an opportunity to provide legal assistance to them. We are also deeply grateful to the lawyers who worked on this case, especially senior Advocate Sanjay Parikh, who has led the legal team.\nImportant Documents  Application filed by PUCL (link) Zombie Tracker (link) Research paper titled ‘Section 66A and other legal zombies’ by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta (link) IFF post summarising the February 2019 Supreme Court decision which directed Union of India to ensure compliance with the decision in Shreya Singhal (link) IFF post noting the non-compliance Supreme Court decision of February 2019 and announcing the development of the Zombie Tracker (link) IFF post providing an update on the development of the Zombie Tracker (link) IFF post marking the fifth anniversary of the Shreya Singhal Judgment (link) IFF post calling for greater participation in the consultation process of the Draft Vision Document (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/pucl-approaches-supreme-court-seeking-directions-against-continued-prosecutions-under-the-unconstitutional-section-66a/","summary":"Supreme Court issues notice in PUCL\u0026rsquo;s application seeking directions against continued enforcement of Section 66A.

We filed an RTI application with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on May 18, 2021 to understand more about the process and to verify the authenticity of such reports. In their reply to our RTI application dated June 24, 2021 the Ministry confirmed the use of facial recognition for verification of beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccines but failed to provide any guidelines or SOP that clearly delineates the technical and implementation details of facial recognition technology (FRT) for COVID-19 vaccine verification.\nBackground Government had implied its plans to roll out Aadhaar based facial recognition technology (FRT) as the mode of verification of the personal data of the beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccines purportedly to make the vaccination process “touchless”, thus replacing the existing practice of biometric verification at vaccination centres through fingerprints and iris scans. This indicates that using Aadhaar cards for the purposes of registration for COVID-19 vaccines can potentially become mandatory, thereby posing grave threats to the privacy and other constitutional rights of the citizens.\nDespite official statements of government authorities affirming that biometric authentication for vaccination was not currently in practice as well as the clarification of the MoHFW in the Lok Sabha that Aadhaar was not mandatory for vaccine registration and several other IDs were accepted for the registration process, this unchecked roll-out of FRT based registration system has caused anxiety and apprehension among many.\nWe filed an RTI application asking the MoHFW to furnish details about the use of FRT In our RTI application with the MoHFW dated May 18, 2021, we had sought information about but not limited to:\n the legislation or rule which authorised the use of FRT for COVID-19 vaccine registration; the specific technology procured for the use of FRT based authentication; the details about the storage and use of the data thus collected; whether any privacy impact assessment was conducted before deploying FRT for vaccine registrations; copies of any guidelines or SOPs which outlined the use of FRT for the registration process and other relevant information.  You can peruse all of the questions that we asked by taking a look at a copy of the RTI application here.\nMoHFW confirmed that FRT is being used as a part of the vaccination process In response to our RTI application on June 24, 2021, MoHFW acknowledged the use of FRT as one of the methods for online verification of the beneficiaries. They further stated that the images captured through FRT would be sent to UIDAI for verification and not stored in any distinct database. According to their reply, no additional procurement was made for the implementation of FRT based verification. They also informed us that a pilot project for facial recognition authentication is still under continuation. According to reports, this pilot project is being conducted in Jharkhand.\nHowever, MoHFW failed to specify any legislative or legal order that authorised the use of FRT nor could they provide copies of any relevant privacy impact assessment. Furthermore, the reply stated that use of FRT for verification of the beneficiaries’ data would be according to the terms furnished in the ‘Verifier \u0026amp; Vaccinator Module User Manual’ included in the COWIN portal which was not available on COWIN portal or any open source webpage. Lastly, they were unable to provide us with any information related to the accuracy of the FRT used, any third party assessments which may have been conducted and the exhaustive list of databases with which the facial recognition technology will be linked in order to identify individuals.\nWhile we appreciate MoHFW conferring this response, we are afraid that they have failed to supply accurate information and have been evasive in their response. This is highly disconcerting since it violates the tenet of transparency under the RTI Act, creates further ambiguity regarding the registration process and offsets the promise of a universal and inclusive vaccination policy which indeed is the crying need of the hour.\nFRT based verification for vaccination should be stopped The COVID-19 vaccines are essential, life saving commodities in the current pandemic and ensuring equitable \u0026amp; indiscriminate access to the vaccines for all is of paramount importance. However, deploying Aadhaar based FRT for the verification process, deprives the citizens who do not possess or have not linked their Aadhaar cards to the COWIN portal or the on-site register, of the vital vaccines. Further, there is evidence that FRT is highly error prone and as may be gleaned from MoHFW’s response, no clearly defined testing or legal vetting was done prior to the deployment. Consequently, the risk of FRT failing to correctly identify the beneficiaries and thereby potentially excluding a significant portion of the population from the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines, looms large.\nMoHFW informed us that no privacy impact assessment of the use of FRT was conducted prior to its deployment. We have already enunciated the privacy concerns related to the data collected by UIDAI through Aadhar.\nUse of FRT in vaccine registration process borders on function creep In the past, there have been numerous incidents wherein FRTs deployed for a specific reason have been utilised for purposes beyond its original mandate. Thus fears of using the data procured through the FRT in vaccination for larger surveillance would not be unfounded. This is further aggravated by the fact that the User Manual mentioned by MoHFW in their reply to our RTI is not publicly available. This creates further confusion and anxiety regarding how the data would be collected, stored and used by the government authorities.\nImposing arbitrary requirements of enrolment with inaccurate and exclusionary digital identification schemes without any privacy safeguards is highly problematic and can adversely impact India’s fight against COVID-19.\nImportant Documents  RTI application filed with MoHFW on May 18, 2021 (link) Response received from MoHFW on June 24, 2021 (link) Joint Statement: Say no to Aadhaar based Facial Recognition for Vaccination! dated April 14, 2021 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/government-endorses-the-use-of-facial-recognition-for-touchless-vaccination-process/","summary":"We filed an RTI application with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to verify reports about the government using facial recognition technology (FRT) for the verification of beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccines.

To explain this phenomenon, we will be taking a look at how FRT works currently, i.e., on the basis of its rate of accuracy wherein it generates possible matches while not giving a final result. Further, we will also try to understand whether evidence garnered from the use of this inaccurate technology can be admissible in courts.\nHow does the Police use facial recognition? FRT can be used for two purposes mainly: verification and identification. Verification is done by matching the live photograph of a person to the pre-existing photograph that is on the authority’s database (1:1). Use of FRT for verification is done to authenticate the identity of an individual seeking to gain access to any benefits or government schemes. Identification is done by trying to get a match between the face of an individual which has been extracted from a photograph/video and the entire database of the authority in order to ascertain the identity of the individual (1:many). Use of FRT for identification is usually done for the purposes of security and surveillance. For this post, we are concerned only with FRT which is used for identification purposes by the Police.\nFRT systems generate a probability match score, or a confidence score between the suspect who is to be identified and the database of identified criminals that the Police has access to already (for eg. the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System). Multiple possible matches are generated and listed on the basis of their likelihood to be the correct match with corresponding confidence scores. The final identification, however, is done by the human analyst who selects one match from the list of matches generated by the technology. This identification procedure is ripe for misidentification because while the software releases several possible matches, the analyst conducting the search makes the final identification.This also opens the door for the analyst’s own biases to creep into the final result wherein they may be prejudiced against a certain race, religion or community, based on which their decision making may be affected.\nWhat does the rate of accuracy signify? The accuracy rates generated by the FRT depend on a number of factors such as camera quality, light, distance, database size, algorithm, and the suspect’s race and gender. Advanced systems can achieve accuracy rates of 90%, which means that false positive rates can go as low as 10%. Misidentification, or false positives, occur when a person is identified as someone they are not and is especially problematic as it can lead to the police pursuing and charging an innocent person for a crime they did not commit. Comparing this to other biometric data which may be used as evidence such as fingerprints, it is important to remember that,\n “(i)f the sample is contaminated or does not have enough of the biometric data, either insufficient DNA or a partial latent fingerprint, the result is inconclusive. Facial recognition is different; even if the matches include the correct suspect, the analyst conducting the search and selecting the match to forward to investigators may choose the wrong individual. The correct match may not even be in the list of results identified by the software, but the analyst reviewing the results may find a match anyway, thereby implicating an innocent person (a false positive).”\n Here, it is also important to note that use of FRT is taking place in India without there being any standards in place to regulate the technology or certify its quality. Thus, there is a very real possibility that a sub-par FRT system is adopted by the Police which leads to misidentification, and ultimately, a false conviction.\nInaccuracy, however, is not an Indian problem which can be solved with “better” technology. According to a report by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) own statistics suggest that one out of every seven searches of its facial recognition database fails to turn up a correct match, meaning the software occasionally produces 50 “potential” matches who are all “innocent”. While we do not have any complete information about all FRT systems in India and their respective accuracy rates due to a lack of transparency on the part of the government authorities, it is safe to assume that their accuracy rates will be significantly lower than the FBI’s 86% accuracy rate which has access to the most advanced technology in the world. According to a submission made before the High Court of Delhi, the accuracy rate of the FRT being used by the Delhi Police is 2%.\nSo how is FRT evidence used in Court? Firstly, since FRT is not completely accurate, it may not be presented in Court as evidence, but only used to provide investigatory leads. In this situation, the defendant may not even be informed that FRT was used by the Police to build the case against them. This is because it may also contain exculpatory evidence which may work against the State itself. This point was put forward by the ACLU in the amicus curiae brief in the matter of Willie Allen Lynch V. State Of Florida, wherein the ACLU states that the analyst’s use of FRT created information that would tend to exculpate him and/or impeach the state’s witnesses, including but not limited to:\n Other possible matches that the FRT generated, indicating the possibility of alternate perpetrator; the analyst’s choice to send only the defendant’s photo to investigators, indicating improper suggestiveness; the range of possible matches and their probability scores; an executable version of the software and the source code (which is prone to error and bias) and the analyst’s lack of training in forensic face analysis.  All of this evidence would have indicated uncertainty in the identification procedure according to the brief.\nAnother way in which FRT evidence may be used in Court is when it is supported by eyewitness testimony. However, it may be noted here that use of eyewitness evidence for human identification is also problematic as “memory for a face is affected by the introduction of subsequent misleading information about that face, contradicting the view that faces are special in their lack of susceptibility to interference”. According to a study conducted in the US on proven cases of wrongful convictions, 52% were based on eyewitness testimony.\nThis is because eyewitness evidence works best when the witness is pre-acquainted with the suspect as the probability is extremely low. If the witness does not know the suspect beforehand, then it is also especially easy to be hoodwinked by FRT as it generates matches which are similar to the suspect thereby confusing the witness. Additionally, if the eyewitness knows that the individual was identified through FRT, it may sway them to also positively identify the suspect. Thus, people who have similar features may have a higher chance of being misidentified. While sometimes such eyewitness testimony is provided by a bystander, usually, however, it may be the arresting officers themselves who testify in Court about the FRT evidence, as was the case for Willie Lynch, which may lead to further bias.\nThe final scenario for admissibility of FRT evidence in Court is where the evidence is admitted without any other supporting testimony, solely on its own. We currently have no clear sense of whether such evidence will be admissible in the absence of eyewitness testimony. Here, parallels can be drawn between how biometric evidence is treated in Indian courts wherein such evidence has to be supported by expert testimony. Assuming that the person who created the algorithm is the expert here, we are still waiting for such testimony to be provided in Court in matters related to FRT. However, it can be said that its admissibility will depend on a case to case basis, just like any other expert testimony is treated. Additionally, in such a situation, the defendant then should also be provided with the access to the software’s source code to meaningfully challenge the evidence presented against them.\nImportant Documents  Is the illegal use of facial recognition technology by the Delhi Police akin to mass surveillance?

We specifically examine this through the recent Consultation Paper on IDEA by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation, and Family Welfare. Who really benefits from Agristack systems and how does a loss of privacy affect farmers?\nBackground Last week, in the first post in our new #PrivacyOfThePeople series, we used recent protests by ASHA workers to look at larger issues with worker surveillance under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The growing number of intrusive systems only undermine the fundamental right to privacy, and negatively impact free speech and worker unionization. Privacy cannot be compromised in the name of “efficiency”.\nThis series continues to discuss the very concrete problems that different groups will face after the implementation of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and so, for this week, we decided to look at an issue that is generating a lot of discussion at present: the rights of the farmers of India. Our engagement with agriculture in India has taken place mostly through the Agristack, a proposed project for implementing digital agriculture systems across India (to better understand what the Agristack really is, please see our public explainer on the issue). We have written a joint letter with 55 other organizations to the Ministry of Agriculture highlighting our concerns with the project. We have also analyzed the various MoUs signed by the Ministry regarding a pilot for the Agristack (see here and here). In this post, we will be taking a closer look at some of the issues with the Agristack project, and how the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill may exacerbate such problems.\nThe issue The recently published Consultation Paper on IDEA-India Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation, and Family Welfare proposed a digital architecture for the agricultural industry. This is a new addition to the rapidly developing Agristack in India. The Agristack is a collection of technologies and digital databases proposed by the Central Government focussing on India’s farmers and the agricultural sector. The central government has claimed that these new databases are being built to primarily tackle issues such as poor access to credit and wastage in the agricultural supply chain. It is important to understand why there is such keen interest in agricultural data.\n“Big Data” can be defined as “a collection of data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside your company that represents a source for ongoing discovery and analysis”. The agricultural industry stands on the front line with other industries in the Big Data revolution. In agriculture, tremendous leaps in data acquisition equipment on everything from tractors to granaries coupled with instantaneous and continuous transmission of that data through cellular modems create a dataset soon to rival that of any industry. Yet, with the increased generation of agricultural data arises the concerns of data collection and usage.\nHere are some of the broader issues with Agristack so far:\n Implementation before consultation: As can be seen through the signing of MoUs with several IT corporations, it is alarming that without adequate consultations, MEITY has stated that the blueprint for Agristack is already in the advanced stage. While the agriculture sector would indeed benefit from the use of technology to aid both production and marketing, doing so in a manner that excludes the main intended beneficiaries may end up exacerbating existing problems. Lack of representation: A clear lack of any consultation with farmers and a lack of representation in the task force. While private companies are being consulted, there has been insufficient to none engagement with the leading agricultural organizations and unions in India. Loss of privacy: The proposed framework for Agristack does indeed face serious questions related to privacy. Farms generate a huge amount of data in their daily operations, and so are fertile ground for agritech and fintech firms. As has been seen before, this would lead to “banks and insurance companies [knowing] more about the incomes and businesses of farms than the individual farmers themselves”. No consent: A lack of farmers’ consent. Any system that uses a person’s data must have that person as a stakeholder in that system’s decision-making and governance process. Despite the fact that the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 mandates consent in processing personal data, farmers have not been informed or even involved in the conversation. No protection: The paper states that it aims to “(l)ay down clear policies specific to the agriculture domain that enable and regulate the sharing of data, in conformance with the applicable data protection regulations” but currently we do not have any such data protection regulations in place. Moreover, the current Bill does not protect non-personal data. However, MoUs signed with private companies like Amazon \u0026amp; Patanjali give them access to a lot of information, with no farmers' consent or security for pertinent data on their lands, income, loans, etc. Inscrutable nature of the paper: The paper is daily ambiguous. Buzzwords such as “AI” and “ML” have been used without stating where exactly artificial intelligence models would be used. It has been reiterated that farmers would be economically benefited without explaining how. It is also unclear who owns IDEA. Furthermore, there are no grievance redressal mechanisms nor is it made clear what happens to farmers outside this system.  Overall, the IDEA paper and the proposed Agristack seem to benefit the government and private corporations more than the farmers. Agricultural data is being collected without the consent or consultation of farmers themselves, for the benefit of private agencies. In the absence of a data protection law, the consequent loss of privacy can negatively impact farmers in the following ways:\n Financial lending models relying on technology towards farmers may offer extortionary rates for those in dire need. Given the incomplete nature of land title records, farmers may also be exploited by land grabs by large agribusinesses. Algorithm-based decision-making may further **** reduce the agency of farmers if and when AI-based decision-making becomes widespread, possibly impacting on legal rights.  The PDP Bill and Farmers’ Rights The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDP) has no specific provisions for agricultural data. Thus, the treatment of agricultural data would depend on how it gets classified. Certain farm data may be classified as non-personal data. Non-personal data is not protected under the Bill, and is instead to be dealt with under a separate non-personal data governance framework. As we have written earlier, the currently proposed framework is quite lax and allows gross violations of user consent by providing entities the opportunity to exploit large datasets without much oversight. Thus, it is likely that non-personal agricultural data will be exploited.\nHowever, we already know that significant amounts of personal data will be processed under the Agristack framework (this was reiterated in the MoUs as well). Thus, we must also consider the future of agricultural data through this lens. Here, two main issues exist:\n Potential lack of consent: The Agristack is being rolled out under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. The Ministry also has plans to integrate the platform with several agriculture schemes being implemented by the government. Thus, under clause 12 of the Bill, which allows personal data to be processed without consent for the performance of a State function, farmers’ data may be harvested. Were this data to remain with the government, this may not have been as pressing an issue. However, given the proposed scale of integration in the Agristack, it is likely that private entities will also be able to easily access these datasets (especially if access to services becomes contingent upon the provision of said data). Clause 14, which allows the non-consensual processing of data for ‘reasonable purposes’ such as credit scoring and the operation of search engines, also seems to imply such a possibility. Constrained user rights: The Bill provides users with certain rights over their data. However, the Bill also sets certain limitations on the exercise of these rights, and from here stems the potential for misuse and exploitation. For example, clause 19 provides for the right to data portability but allows companies the leeway to deny such requests on grounds of technical infeasibility or protection of a trade secret. Alternatively, clause 20 allows data processors to reject requests under the right to be forgotten if it feels that the data in question has not served the purpose for which it was collected; the burden for proving this, of course, is on the user. Furthermore, clause 21 provides that users may be charged with fees for exercising these very rights. Now consider this in the context of the Agristack: will a farmer really be able to get a company to delete his/her data, given the significant difference in bargaining power? This will lead to farmers becoming beholden to the platform and the companies that are on it - this clearly cannot be good for farmer’s welfare! Moreover, the already severely indebted farmers may be asked to pay onerous fees for trying to assert their rights.  Solution Other jurisdictions have laid down specific guidelines and laws for dealing with agricultural data. These include the US American Farm Bureau Federations’ (AFBF) Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data, the New Zealand Farm Data Code, and the EU Code of Conduct on Agricultural Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement. These codes cover central issues such as terminology, data ownership, data rights (including the right to access, data portability, and the right to erasure/right to be forgotten), privacy issues, security, consent, disclosure, and transparency. In addition, they all attempt to harness the benefits of agricultural data while protecting producers’ privacy and security.\nThe AFBF championed Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data, for example, is an agreement between influential farm organizations and Agriculture Technology Providers (ATP). It is an affirmation of belief (or promise) by the signatory ATPs that their business relationships should operate and data should be collected, used, and managed in accordance with the Farm Data Principles. Any Indian regulations protecting agricultural data must set clear expectations regarding a diverse set of interrelated data issues including education, ownership, collection, access, control, transparency, and more. Here are some of our recommendations:\n Comprehensive Consultations: There needs to be discussion on the merits of the proposal with farmer groups and unions on their very premise before any policy document is implemented. The utilisation of technology must happen on the basis of feedback that emerges from these conversations. Long-term study and Advocacy: Academics, technologists, civil society and digital rights organisations to be engaged with on the development of the “Agristack” both as a policy framework and its execution proceeding from the concerns and experiences of farmers. Privacy for Farmers: Examination of the relationship between personal data and digital policies such as the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) to be conducted in the context of the ongoing process of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Data Protection Bill. Strengthen User Rights: The rights of users under the Bill have to be reviewed to ensure that the right to privacy of users gets primacy and the interests of data fiduciaries are addressed through limited exceptions. Protecting non-personal data: Allow non-personal data to be regulated under the Data Protection Authority. This shifts the focus onto the protection of digital rights and the responsibility of providing robust regulatory mechanisms would fall on the Data Protection Authority. This also protects important data of farmers such as lands, income, loans, etc from being misused by private companies.  Given that in India, agriculture contributes to 19% of the country’s GDP (according to the Economic Survery 2020-21) and provides employment to around 58% of the population, a lot more can and should be done to protect the interests, autonomy, and privacy of farmers.\nThis is the second post in our #PrivacyOfThePeople series on how the Personal Data Protection Bill will impact different facets of our life; you can read part 1 on worker surveillance here.

In this post, we analyse these MoUs, and explain what they mean for Indian agriculture.\nIntroduction and context On 19th May, 2021, in response to an RTI query by us, the Ministry of Agriculture provided us a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Department of Agriculture and Microsoft. Now, the Department of Agriculture has made public its MoUs with Star Agribazaar, ESRI Technologies, Patanjali and even Amazon. All these MoUs are part of the Agristack project, for which these entities will be helping to create a pilot program in 100 villages across India (to understand the Agristack better - please see our public explainer).\nBefore we discuss the MoUs between the Agriculture Department and the various private stakeholders, we ought to set out that a memorandum of understanding is a non-binding document, it is not enforceable in a court of law, and it ordinarily has very bare, broad and illustrative provisions. Typically an MoU is executed only to set out, in writing, what the understanding is between two parties, and to provide a roadmap for negotiations pursuant to which a binding contract is executed between those parties. However, since the MoU is a roadmap for negotiations towards a binding agreement, and also sets out the understanding between two parties, it is extremely important and helpful for us to understand some of the conversations around AgriStack and data protection.\nWe had previously analysed the MoU between the Department of Agriculture and Microsoft, and found some interesting points. Exhibit A of the MoU (page 7) has a summary of the project and bullet points on what the government will contribute and what Microsoft will contribute. Broadly, the solution proposed is that farmer’s data will be used to authenticate their identity for the receipt of entitlements under agricultural schemes. Under the Microsoft MoU, ownership of the data, and the responsibility for its security will reside with the Ministry of Agriculture. However, the Ministry will share its datasets with Microsoft. Absolutely no clarity has been provided on how the data will be protected.\nNew MoUs Like the Microsoft MoU, the MoU with Patanjali Organic Research Institute has a summary of the project and bullet points on what the government will contribute and what Microsoft will contribute. It proposes to build a “Farmer Registry for Farmers Data \u0026amp; Analytics Services'' with the purpose of consolidating farmer information. The Farmer Registry makes several proposals, including the following:\n Unified Farmer Service Interface: Data related to farmer welfare, farm management, and farmer advisory services along with an analysis of existing Government schemes will be pooled to build a unified farmer service interface, which will also consider the farmers' eligibility for various government schemes \u0026amp; its actual beneficiaries. A national farmer database is, thus, proposed to be integrated with participation from states. The MoU claims that this will further accelerate the 360 degree engagement with farmers to support them across their ecosystem like providing farmer identity on platform, support for imparting benefits of the government schemes. An App containing various data sets: Patanjali will build this farmer interface, and also an app version, which will contain data sets including nutrient profiling of soil, accurate quantification of the farmer crop and yield, and even the demographic details of farmers combined with geo-tagging and geofencing.  The AgriStack proposes a \u0026lsquo;Nation Agriculture Geo Hub\u0026rsquo;, for which the MoU with Esri India Technologies, has been entered into:\n Collection of Geo-spatial information: This will establish a framework to collect and integrate available geo-spatial information with other associated information, perform spatial analytics, share results and data, and deploy apps to support policy planning and monitoring requirements. Data hosted on cloud services: It is proposed to create and collate farmer and other agriculture data/ services on Esri’s geographical information system (GIS) platform. This Geo Spatial Agri Platform for Farmers shall be hosted on cloud/ on premises.  Another key part of the Agristack project is the proposed digital platform for farmers that would include an integrated marketplace and access to other services. It is for this purpose that the Ministry of Agriculture has also signed an MoU with Agribazaar, which will host this platform on its server during the pilot. Agribazaar will provide access to this platform to any users or partners permitted by the Ministry, and must be integrated with other government initiatives such as the eNAM platform, and schemes like PM-KISAN. Beyond this, Agribazaar will have to undertake certain other activities, including:\n Sanitisation of Farmer Data: On the basis of data from three central government schemes (PM-KISAN, Soil Health card, and PMFBY), Agribazaar must compile and prepare a dataset that will be compared to land records data. Any mismatches will be notified to the Department of Agriculture, for which field surveys will be conducted. This field data shall then be assimilated into the cleaned dataset. Agri-land profiling and crop estimation: Through remote sensing technology, Agribazaar shall conduct land cover mapping, soil degradation mapping, crop identification, crop yield and modelling and production estimation, and past and current weather data analysis. Advisory Platform for Farmers: The farmers’ platform will be an advisory platform for farmers that must be available in app form. It will include pre harvest services (such as weather forecasts, soil preparation advisory services, and other crop management services), post harvest services (such as lists of APMC yards, data about arrivals and price trends, and lists of warehouses and their charges), marketplace services (such as a unified digital agriculture marketplace), and financial services (such credit scores for farmers on the abscess of past data and a unified platform for credit services for farmers)  Lastly, this entire apparatus will require backend support in terms of cloud services and data management, for which the Ministry has signed an MoU with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Under this MoU, Amazon will have two main obligations:\n Building the National Agri Data Stack: AWS will help in building an open and scalable platform for farmers. This would extend to both a larger planning role, in terms of identifying further partners for the project and assisting in finalising the scope of the project (including the final use cases to be rolled out), and a more technical support role, which would include offering its cloud services platform as well any other technical support. AWS will also develop a leadership paper on AI in agriculture along with the Ministry, and provide inputs on the proposed PPP model. Enabling the startup ecosystem: AWS will extend its Startups program to the Ministry. It will provide technical training and guidance to identified startups, assist the Ministry in organising innovation challenges, create mechanisms for connecting startups with potential customers, and help in bringing in other potential ecosystem players such as VCs and impact investors.  Concerns As with the earlier MoU with Microsoft, the Ministry of Agriculture will share all the data sets with Patanjali, Esri India, Amazon and AgriBazaar, while retaining ownership and responsibility for security of the data. Absolutely no clarity has been provided in any of the MoUs regarding how the data sets are to be kept secure, beyond the role allocation of data security being given to the Ministry of Agriculture. Further, the Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) at Appendix A of the MoUs, are vague on the subject of whether farmers’ data shared under the respective MoUs is considered “confidential information”, and thus subject to protection under the NDA. Another concern is that the State departments have not been made parties to this MoU, even though agriculture is a state subject under the Constitution of India.\nA GRAIN report titled ‘Digital fences: the financial enclosure of farmlands in South America’ has already brought to attention how digitalisation has enabled the land grabs by large scale agribusinesses in Latin America, while the requirement of digital land records for access to public schemes for agriculture has resulted in large scale exclusion. Thus, here, the Agristack may be a double-edged sword: in case such cases are rushed over and dealt with in a perfunctory manner, the resultant injustice in the form of dispossession would be locked in, whereas if land disputes are adequately addressed and resolved, India’s farmers could rest assured that their land holdings have been digitally enshrined. Thus, there is an urgent need to address all such land disputes before creating such a database, especially since compensation-based dispute settlements have generally led to highly inadequate compensation for farmers and lengthy delays in payment.\nThis is of particular concern when seen along with the MoU with Patanjali, which offers to Patanjali a large amount of data, particularly in relation to soil quality, nutrient profile, crop yield, fertilizer quantities etc. The data also includes demographic data, which could mean more than purely commercial data - it includes socio-economic factors such as gender, age, place of residence and even religion. That this demographic data is sought specifically in relation to geo-tagging and geo-fencing presents a matter of great concern, in view of the GRAIN report discussed above.\nAdditionally, at a more granular level, the MoU with AWS seems to imply that the Ministry of Agriculture may designate the security and ownership of a given dataset to AWS, meaning that Amazon will get access to further swathes of data, most of it without the consent of farmers. The MoU also seems to provide Amazon with a significant amount of sway over the direction of the Agristack Project. Given the absolute lack of consultation with main stakeholders (i.e. farmers) so far, this may further be an indication of the pro corporate nature of this undertaking.\nMeanwhile, the MoU with Agribazaar seems to give Agribazaar a central role in building out the platform for the pilot project. This would give it control not only over massive amounts of data, but also over the functioning of the platform. However, no measures for accountability seem to be visible. Furthermore, the MoU effectively allows Agribazaar to share data with third parties. Now, while the MoU does state that all parties must adhere to personal data protection laws, given that the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is yet to be passed, it is unclear whether the processing of data will be regulated in any significant manner.\nSimilarly, the MoU with Esri India in relation to the development of the ‘Nation Agriculture Geo Hub’ appears to imply not just the sharing, but also the creation of detailed data sets, by integrating existing farmer data with their geographical data.\nMore MoUs on the way! On 9th July, an office memorandum in the Department of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare was notified, which stated that\n “proposals are invited from leading IT companies/ Agriculture Companies/ FPOs/Start-ups/Research Bodies for collaborating with this Department on pro bono basis to build of PoCs/Use Case Scenarios/Layers around Farmers Database. The Department would be willing to enter into a year long MoU with the identified partners and work towards improving the farmers database based solutions addressing various areas of Agriculture”.\n Thus, it is likely that we will see more MoUs signed in the near future.\nOnce again, it must be noted here that consultations with farmers and farmer groups are yet to be held, while more and more private companies are being solicited to harvest farmers’ data. Meanwhile, government capacity is being discarded or disregarded: for example, the Ministry of Earth Sciences had launched a weather app for farmers known as Meghdoot in 2019. This app provided both general and crop specific weather advisories for free to farmers. Under the current implementation of the Agristack, however, it is likely that private services will be favoured over initiatives such as Meghdoot, thereby increasing costs without resulting in significant increase in value. Thus, once again, we urge the government to put the Agristack project on hold and conduct extensive consultations with the supposed beneficiaries of the Agristack: the farmers of India.\nImportant Documents  MoUs signed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare with Amazon Web Services, Patanjali Organic Research Ltd, Esri India Technologies Pvt Ltd (link, link, link, \u0026amp; link) Office Memorandum (Z-11021/16/2021-IT) regarding \u0026ldquo;Inviting of proposals from leading IT companies/ Agriculture Companies/ FPOs/Start-ups/Research Bodies for collaborating with this Department on pro bono basis to build of PoCs/Use Case Scenarios/Layers around Farmers Database – reg.\u0026rdquo; (link) Previous blogpost dated 20th May, 2021 titled “Revealed: Ministry of Agriculture’s MOU with Microsoft on the Agristack.

The Draft Rules make provision for a vital public service, i.e. live streaming of court proceedings, and invited comments from the public by June 30, 2021. IFF submitted its comments to the Draft Rules welcoming the Rules and expressed its strong support for their implementation. However, at the same time, we suggested that the Rules in their final form can strike a better balance between litigant/witness privacy and the public interest in disclosure.\nBackground The Supreme Court’s e-Committee released Draft Model Rules for Live-Streaming and Recording of Court Proceedings on May 28, 2021 (the Draft Rules) and sought public comments on the draft until June 30, 2021. This is a huge step for transparency in the judicial process, and will bring much greater accessibility regarding the higher judiciary for the ordinary public. This has been made possible by the advocacy of Ms. Indira Jaisingh and her team, particularly in the matter of Swapnil Tripathi v. Supreme Court of India and others.\nIn that petition, it was argued that the right to seek and receive information including live streaming of proceedings from the Supreme Court is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution; the move will strengthen public confidence in the Judiciary by furthering transparency and the principle of Open Justice; and that recording and live streaming the proceedings of cases of public importance would completely negate the chances of any misreporting\nThese arguments were accepted by the Supreme Court, which held that open trials and access to the public during hearing of cases before the Court is an accepted proposition, and that live streaming of Court proceedings can allow the public to witness live court proceedings.\nIn our previous blogpost, we laid out the provisions of the Draft Rules and analysed what kind of cases and court events will be available for streaming and recording, and what will not. We noted that any such move must properly achieve the balance between privacy and the public interest.\nOur Recommendations In our opinion, small amendments are still required to improve the balance between privacy and public interest, though we are cognisant that the Draft Rules have made a clear and mindful attempt to strike such a balance. The comments we have offered to the Draft Rules make an attempt to improve this balance through minor tweaks. We offered the following recommendations:\n Remove ambiguity in Rule 3.2: Rule 3.2 of the Draft Rules requires the Dedicated Control Room (DCR) to ensure that nothing “uncivil or inappropriate” is streamed in the public, but no clarity has been provided as to what constitutes “uncivil” or “inappropriate”. In such cases, it is presently left to the discretion of technical experts to decide what is uncivil and inappropriate. We recommended that the Draft Document must remove this ambiguity and lay down clearer guidelines and standards for ‘civil’ and ‘appropriate’ content. Tighter protections for victims/witnesses: Rule 5.8 of the Draft Rules provides for the maintenance of anonymity of the recorded testimony of victims/witnesses in criminal cases, by using dummy names, voice distortion, pixelation and face masking. **** In cases where anonymity of victims and witnesses cannot be maintained in the recordings via these technological solutions, for reasons of technical glitches or logistical failures, there is no guidance on how the control room is to proceed. We recommended that it should be clarified that the proceedings are adjourned until such issues are resolved. No provision to secure personal data: Since the recordings concern legal proceedings of individual litigants, including criminal proceedings, they are likely to contain sensitive personal data. In fact, even the participation of an individual in a criminal trial may in itself be sensitive information. While the Draft Rules include detailed provisions for what sort of information has to be screened from streaming publicly, they are less clear on what sort of information can be screened from recording at all, since Rule 5.7 requires recordings to be maintained for all cases, even when such recordings are not being live-streamed. Since all recordings are also required to be saved for at least six months under Rule 7.4, we sought clarity on how this data will be secured. This is of particular concern since India does not have a data protection regime. Greater protection for personal information is required: Rule 8.1 of the Draft Rules provides for general precautions in relation to personal data, and suggests that “any one of the masking techniques, as provided under Rule 6.8, may be adopted”. However, there is no Rule 6.8 in the Draft Rules (the sub-parts of Rule 6 are Rules 6.1-6.5). We requested that in the event this is a typographical error, and Rule 8.1 intended to refer to the masking techniques in Rule 5.8, clarity be provided in Rule 8.1 as well regarding the situations where such masking techniques are unavailable for technical or logistical reasons, to prevent the control room from proceeding without the masking techniques. 10 minute delay in streaming: Similarly, the requirement for there to be a ten-minute delay in streaming under Rule 8.3.i. also does not provide any standards or objectives sought to be achieved by such delay. The delay may well serve the legitimate purpose of ensuring that no inappropriate content is streamed, but without clear guidelines on how the time is to be used, such a provision is open to misuse.  Since the proposals in the Draft Rules also apply to all district and sessions courts in rural India, we noted that special care is required during the implementation stage to upgrade and upkeep the electronic infrastructure and personnel at such courts. A team of technical experts and an extensive recruitment and training exercise will be required for every court. We expressed our belief that the success of the proposal to enable live-streaming of judicial proceedings depends on the successful implementation of the hardware and personnel aspects of the Draft Document, and expressed our confidence that the e-Committee will be able to successfully implement the Draft Document in this manner.\nPlease give your comments! This is the second such document that the e-Committee has released in the past couple of months. In April 2021, the e-Committee released the Draft Vision document for Phase III of eCourts Project. We submitted our comments to that document with the e-Committee. We have now also submitted our comments to the e-Committee regarding the new Draft Live-Streaming Rules.\nWe believe that in a democracy, it is the civic duty of each and every individual to strengthen our democracy by encouraging and participating in consultative processes. We encourage you to share your comments to the Draft Live-Streaming Rules with us on our forum and tell us what you think, and also to independently offer your comments and suggestions to the e-Committee via email at ecommittee@aij.gov.in.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s comments to the Draft Model Rules for Live-Streaming and Recording of Court Proceedings (link) Copy of the Draft Model Rules for Live-Streaming and Recording of Court Proceedings (link) Previous blog post dated 18 June, 2021 titled “Live and let Live: The Supreme Court releases draft rules for live streaming of court proceedings” (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/striking-the-balance-between-privacy-and-public-interest-in-judicial-proceedings-our-comments-to-the-supreme-courts-draft-live-streaming-rules/","summary":"Draft Model Rules for Live-Streaming and Recording of Court Proceedings were released by the Supreme Court’s e-Committee.

The Government imposed these restrictions without complying with the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, (2020) 3 SCC 637, which requires that any such restrictions must have a publicly disclosed legal basis. Foundation of Media Professionals has addressed a legal notice dated June 23rd to the Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir asking them to comply with the Anuradha Bhasin judgement_._ IFF provided legal assistance to FMP.\nBackground On August 5th, 2019, the Union Government imposed a complete communication shutdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir in the immediate aftermath of abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution. All communication channels, including landlines, voice calls, SMS services, fixed-line internet and mobile internet services, were suspended in this period. The communication shutdown was challenged by Ms Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of Kashmir Times, before the Supreme Court. The Foundation of Media Professionals (FMP) intervened in the case to support Ms Bhasin’s challenge.\nOn January 10th, 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment which was reported as Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, (2020) 3 SCC 637. The decision recognised the fundamental nature of the right to access the internet and passed detailed directions regarding the safeguards the Government must follow when it exercises power to suspend the internet. Most pertinently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Anuradha Bhasin clarified that any restriction on the internet must have a publicly disclosed legal basis.\nSubsequently, the Right to Information requests showed that State Governments continued to not comply with the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin.\nThe Government of J\u0026amp;K imposed internet suspension in May, 2021 without complying with Anuradha Bhasin **** In May 2021, the Government of J\u0026amp;K imposed internet suspension on three separate occasions.\n On 4th May 2021 internet services were suspended in Sopore, Baramulla District. On 6th May 2021 internet services were suspended in Shopian District. On 17th May 2021, internet services were suspended in Pulwama District.  The Union and the State Governments are empowered to restrict internet services under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. However, the Government can impose restrictions only on the “occurrence of any public emergency”, or in “the interest of public safety” if it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offence [Supreme Court has interpreted this provision in People’s Union of Civil Liberties vs Union of India, (1997) 1 SCC 301].\nTemporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 (Telecom Suspension Rules) provides the procedure to suspend internet services. Rule 2(1) empowers the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry of Home Affairs or Secretary to the State Government in charge of the Home Department to suspend internet services. In unavoidable circumstances, such orders may be issued by a duly authorised officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India. These orders have to be confirmed by the competent authority within 24 hours of the issuance of such orders. After that, a Review Committee has to meet within 5 working days of the order suspending internet services to record whether the order complied with Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.\nThe suspension of internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on the three occasions mentioned above was ordered by the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir Zone. In disregard of the directions in Anuradha Bhasin, the Government of J\u0026amp;K has not published the orders of IGP and the Review Committee. Moreover, orders of the Principal Secretary of the Government of J\u0026amp;K confirming the orders of IGP were only belatedly published sometime in June 2021.\nFMP’s legal notice to the Government of J\u0026amp;K FMP has made sustained efforts to ensure that restrictions on internet services in J\u0026amp;K comply with the law. FMP has bravely and tirelessly participated in several rounds of litigation before the Supreme Court to ensure that the people of J\u0026amp;K can access telemedicine, online education, remote work facilities and virtual courts. FMP has now addressed a legal notice dated June 23rd, 2021, to the Government of J\u0026amp;K.\nIn the legal notice, FMP has pointed out that the Government of J\u0026amp;K has not published orders of the IGP and the Review Committee. FMP has also pointed out that the belated publication of orders of the Principal Secretary confirming the orders of the IGP is not in compliance with the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin and constitutes contempt of court. Such belated publication hinders the ability of affected persons to challenge the order before the High Court or appropriate forum and violates the fundamental rights of the residents in the affected areas.\nFMP has called upon the Government of J\u0026amp;K to undertake the following measures:\n Undertake to immediately publish any subsequent order restricting internet access under the Telecom Suspension Rules, in compliance with the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin. These orders must be published on official government websites and also made available on print and electronic media. Proactively publish orders issued in May 2021 by the Review Committee as well as the Authorised Officer under the Telecom Suspension Rules. These orders must be published on official government websites and also made available on print and electronic media.  IFF provided legal assistance to FMP in the drafting of the notice dated June 23rd, 2021. We hope the Government of J\u0026amp;K seriously considers the recommendations of FMP to ensure the extraordinary power of suspending internet services for the entire population of an area is exercised lawfully and transparently. We also commend the continued efforts of FMP to defend the rights of residents of J\u0026amp;K.\nImportant Documents  FMP’s legal notice dated June 23rd, 2021 (link) The decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India, (2020) 3 SCC 637 (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;SC\u0026rsquo;s Kashmir communication shutdown judgment is just the beginning of a long uphill campaign\u0026rsquo; dated January 10th, 2020 (link) Previous post discussing the non-compliance of Anuradha Bhasin by Governments Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya dated September 28th, 2020 (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;RTI responses from Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat show compliance failure with the Anuradha Bhasin Internet Shutdown decision\u0026rsquo; dated November 10th, 2020 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/foundation-for-media-professionals-writes-to-j-k-govt-seeking-compliance-with-anuradha-bhasin-2/","summary":"In May 2021 the Government of J\u0026amp;K suspended internet services on three occasions, without promptly publishing suspensions orders.

Let’s dive right into it!\nNation State Actors - Who are they and what do they do? A nation-state threat actor is a government sponsored group that forcefully targets and gains illicit access to the networks of other governments or to industry groups to steal, damage, and/or change information.\nIn the past there have been repeated instances of nation state actors using cyberattacks to further their respective agendas. The goal of these attacks can range from stealing intellectual property, attacks against corporations, and quite simply to steal money.\nA 100% rise in significant nation state incidents A research paper titled Nation States, Cyber Conflict and the Web of Profit, conducted by Dr. Mike McGuire, Senior Lecturer in Criminology at the University of Surrey, and sponsored by HP Inc. – highlights there has been a 100% rise in ‘significant’ nation state incidents between 2017-2020.\nThis study analysed over 200 cybersecurity incidents that could be attributed to nation state activity since 2009. It showed that some of the most common targets are the enterprise at 35%, followed by cyber defence at 25%, attacks on the media, government bodies and critical infrastructure at 14%, 12% and 10% respectively.\n    The study also drew from first hand intelligence gathering from informants across the dark web along with consultations with an expert panel of 50 leading practitioners in fields such as cybersecurity, intelligence, government, academia, and law enforcement. Some of the other key findings included:\n 75% of the expert panel opined that COVID-19 presented a ‘significant opportunity’ for nation states to exploit. ‘Supply chain’ attacks saw a rise of 78% in 2019; between 2017 and 2020 there were over 27 distinct supply chain attacks which could be associated with nation state actors. To understand what a Supply chain attack is, click here. There is also evidence that nation states are ‘stock-piling’ Zero Day vulnerabilities. The term “zero-day” refers to a newly discovered software vulnerability. Because the developer has just learned of the flaw, it also means an official patch or update to fix the issue hasn’t been released. So, “zero-day” refers to the fact that the developers have “zero days” to fix the problem that has just been exposed and perhaps already exploited by hackers. Read more about “zero days”, here. The “Web of Profit”: 65% of the expert panel believe nation states are making money from cybercrime, while 58% say it is becoming more common for nation states to recruit cybercriminals to conduct cyberattacks.  The study has some important findings and will help you understand the growing scale of nation state threat actors and their motivations behind these attacks. The research along with all their findings can be found here.\nSo, how can you prevent a breach?  Cyberconflict Treaty: One of the things the study also looked into was the prospect of nations signing a “cyber-treaty”. 70% of the expert panel said it is necessary to create a cyberconflict treaty to de-escalate cyber-tensions and prevent nation states from being drawn into further acts of cyberconflict. However, only 15% believed that any such treaty will be signed in the next 5-10 years, and 37% said it’ll take anywhere around 10-20 years. A further 30% believed there is no prospect of any cyber-treaty within any timeframe. So maybe it’s best we don’t count on diplomacy to save the day anytime soon! Risk Management: Experts of cyber security suggest that a strong foundation of risk management, when applied correctly, can lessen the potential damage, simply by compartmentalizing sensitive data from non-sensitive. Tactical Approach: It is important to build sturdy and resilient systems along with multiple backups, which can easily be recovered after a cyber attack. The next step should be to ensure that the software is updated and patched. Educate! Educate! Educate!: Cybersecurity is not (just) a tech problem. Organizations need to focus on the people, and invest time and resources in training them on digital security practices. They need to be trained keeping in mind the kind of work they do within the organization and the sensitivity of the systems they have access to. Teach them about phishing scams, the importance of updating softwares, and inculcating habits of setting up 2 Factor authentication and using Password Managers.  In other news…  False alarm!: On June 10th, a tweet started doing the rounds that data of 150 Million vaccinated people in India was leaked on the Dark Web. But within a few hours, independent security researchers and the Health Ministry confirmed that no such breach had occurred and our data was safe (for now). TechCrunch has published a really cool piece on how we can address the cybersecurity skills gap through neurodiversity! The article states, “There are many inherent traits in people with autism that are well suited for working in cybersecurity. For example, many people with autism are pattern thinkers and are highly detail-oriented. This allows someone in a threat-hunting position to find those subtle differences between malicious and nonmalicious code and catch the threats that automated tools might miss.” The article makes some really good points and I’d encourage you to dedicate some time and read it.  Some expert advice we received on the last edition of Cybersec Charcha… The last edition of this newsletter focused on what ransomware attacks are. As a part of the post, we also mentioned a few things we can do to prevent ourselves from falling prey to these attacks. One of the tips I suggested is not clicking on links before verifying them. However, our community member Swapneel Patnekar wrote to us and pointed out a really important caveat here. Let’s take a 5 second test: Which amongst these is a malicious domain? https://twitter.com/NordVPN/status/1318888002123403267?s=20.\nWell, in a case such as the one mentioned above, it’s next to impossible to verify what’s a malicious link and what isn’t. But thankfully for us, Swapneel also referred us to a different solution: A better way to counter the phishing problem - to the extent where a login is involved - is by using a password manager. Password managers are not just ideal to store and generate passwords but most of them also come with an “autofill” feature. If the user accesses a phishing domain of a service they regularly use (subject to a log-in), the autofill feature won’t work if the link doesn’t match! However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean we can drop our guard when clicking on unknown links, as the above mentioned solution will work only where a log-in is involved. In most other cases, we must continue to be diligent and avoid opening unknown links as much as possible.\nThanks to Swapneel and all our community members who regularly reach out to us with important feedback that helps us do our work better.

In this post, we discuss the issue of worker surveillance through the ASHA workers’ recent fight for digital privacy. We also detail how the Bill affects workplace surveillance at large. Simply put, there cannot be a compromise on privacy in the name of “efficiency”. Mass surveillance disproportionately affects marginalized groups and only continues to foster mistrust amongst people.\nBackground As has been reported earlier, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is likely to submit its report in the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament. Thus, as we inch closer to the session, it is important that we assiduously scrutinize the existing Bill. It is with this in mind that we launched our previous two series on the Bill recently. The first, #StartfromScratch, was a more general series that provided some context to the bill, explained its provisions in detail, highlighted the key concerns with the Bill, and suggested potential alternative frameworks. In the second series, #DataProtectionTop10, we went into the issues in greater depth, looking at the ten main concerns we had with the Bill.\nIn this new series titled #PrivacyofThePeople, we wish to discuss people-centered concerns surrounding the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Unlike our #DataProtectionTop10 and #StartFromScratch series, this series aims to highlight important issues related to the Bill through different lenses in society and examining how these issues will manifest in our daily lives. Here, we will discuss the direct implications the Bill may have on students, healthcare professionals, farmers, and more.\nThe issue According to recent media reports, the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers in Haryana were made to download a Mobile Device Management (MDM) application that violates their digital privacy. The application, “MDM 360 shield”, was forcefully installed on the workers’ personal phones (most do not earn enough to possess 2 separate phones) by local health department officials. In cases where they were provided with a new phone, the workers were not informed that the application had been pre-installed on the said device.\nThe application allows senior officials to track the locations of ASHA workers and add/delete information on the handsets provided by the department.\n The workers fear it will make them further vulnerable to greater scrutiny and harassment from officials. There is great concern regarding the privacy and safety of the primarily female workers as their coordinators and officials are mostly men. Such intrusive surveillance only hampers any possible unionization efforts.  In a memorandum to CMO Dr. Randeep Singh Punia, the ASHA workers requested to cease the “mandatory” installation of the app on their personal phones. Over 22,000 workers are now fighting against the intrusive app, with most deciding to hand their phones back as a sign of protest.\nYet, it is not the first time that MDM apps are being used for worker surveillance. Huffpost reported a similar tracking system in Panchkula, Haryana. The Municipal Corporation forced sanitation workers to wear GPS-enabled “Human Efficiency” trackers strapped to their wrists. The physical wearable device had a microphone and camera so supervisors could watch and hear workers as they worked. Switching off the tracker during duty hours or straying from the GPS-monitored geo-fence would alert the system resulting in possible salary cuts. This is just another example of the growing number of such surveillance systems in recent years.\nAs part of IFF’s continued efforts to fight against 360-degree surveillance of workers, on the 26th of April 2020, we sent a legal notice to BECIL regarding its procurement of employee tracking devices. The “Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” posed a threat to the privacy of healthcare workers. Our blogpost on the issue can be read for more information.\nIndia has witnessed an increase in the use of biometric authentication, CCTV cameras, device monitoring, and location tracking by employers to monitor the activities of their employees. This surveillance revolution is sweeping India’s government departments, aided by private and state-owned companies who have spotted a lucrative opportunity to push largely untested and deeply invasive systems in the name of “digital innovations”.\nThe problem is that such intrusive surveillance systems are implemented with little oversight, no worker consent, and no public conversation. These systems undermine the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. Turning workplaces into panopticons not only encroaches on these basic rights, but also negatively impacts free speech and unionization. Furthermore, such surveillance systems are largely being used on marginalized members of the country’s workforce.\nThe PDP Bill and Worker Surveillance The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDP) prohibits the collection of sensitive personal data by employers for any purpose without the consent of the employee. However, Clause 13 of the Bill allows the processing of personal data which is not classified as sensitive personal data by employers without the consent of the employee for the following purposes:\n recruitment or termination of employment provision of any service or benefit to the employee verification of attendance any other activity relating to the assessment of the performance of the employee  Furthermore, trade union affiliation has not been explicitly recognized as sensitive personal data. This can negatively impact the ability of workers to unionize which is a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. It is integral to protect the workers’ collective voice in any workplace as unionization can help secure worker demands.\n    The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) clearly details employee rights and employer obligations. The GDPR explicitly states that consent to giving data must be “freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous”. With the increased involvement of technology in mass surveillance systems, India’s PDP Bill needs to do more to safeguard the privacy, dignity, and autonomy of workers.\nFor further analysis on the issue, we encourage you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance.\nSolution There cannot be a compromise on data and digital privacy of employees in the name of “efficiency”. Mass surveillance disproportionately affects marginalized groups and only continues to foster mistrust. One solution is imposing a mandatory obligation on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill, 2019. The broader conversation of implementing surveillance systems must be discussed with all stakeholders including respective workers and the public at large.\n The principles of necessity and proportionality in data processing should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill, 2019. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill, 2019. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionization-related activity and prescribe penalties for the same. Trade Union affiliation should be categorized as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill, 2019.

The first time Twitter sent him an email saying the account had been restricted due to a specific tweet posted on the account, but for the second suspension, no information was or has been provided by Twitter to Mr. Singh. He decided to send a formal representation to Twitter highlighting issues with Twitter’s policies and actions, relating to transparency, free expression and consistency, and urged an open dialogue on its policy.\nBackground On February 1, 2021, and May 26, 2021, Twitter temporarily, unilaterally and arbitrarily suspended the account of Sushant Singh (@sushant_says), an actor, author and presenter. The account (operated since September 2010) was verified on August 19, 2020 and has approximately 241.2K followers right now. Mr. Singh is an active voice against hatred, bigotry and fascism on Twitter and is also associated with another Twitter account, @TeamSaath, in the capacity of being their Goodwill Ambassador. This account is run by a team of volunteers who assist users in seeking redressal against hateful or offensive content that they come across on the platform.\nIn the first instance, on February 1, 2021, access to Mr. Singh’s account was withheld without any prior intimation or notice. It appeared that the restriction on access was global, and the page displayed a message that the account had been “withheld in India in response to a legal demand”. It was only sometime later that Twitter sent an email to Mr. Singh stating that access to the account had been restricted due to a specific tweet posted on the account. Mr. Singh deleted the tweet, and yet access to the account was restored only after a lapse of at least 12 hours. In the second instance, on May 26, 2021, the account @sushant_says was again not accessible, and those trying to view it from within India instead saw a message stating that it had been “withheld in India in response to a legal demand”. No communication from Twitter was received regarding this restriction, nor any information about the nature of any purported legal demands. Even though access to the account was restored a few hours later, Mr. Singh has still not received any information in relation to the account restrictions on May 26, 2021.\nWe assisted Sushant in drafting a letter to Twitter Mr. Singh decided to issue a representation to Twitter on June 22, 2021 (the June 22 Letter), which we assisted in drafting. The June 22 Letter laid out the factual background of the account restrictions on @sushant_says, and noted that Mr. Singh’s experience, along with that of other users on the platform, suggests there are serious concerns regarding arbitrariness in content regulation by Twitter Inc, amounting to private censorship of content. Despite Twitter’s expressed commitment to upholding the exercise of free speech and opposition to arbitrariness in content regulation, this experience confirms that the promises are hollow. Rather, Twitter appears to be actively depriving users of any meaningful participation in the process resulting in the takedown of content or suspension of accounts.\nTwitter’s policy as per the terms of service on takedown of content only requires a post facto notification to affected users of any third party requests to withhold content. As per the policy, a notification includes “identification of specific content that has been reported or withheld and the origin of the request”. This approach fails to provide users with any meaningful opportunity to contest the request to takedown content and is evidently an insufficient means to secure a fair hearing in the matter. The policy is also insufficient as it does not require Twitter to communicate why content was found problematic, i.e., whether it was flagged as contrary to law/government order or contrary to policies of using the platform.\nIt is apparent that Twitter’s policy is applied inconsistently. As the case of Mr. Singh shows, in some cases the takedown process is not accompanied by any notice to users whatsoever. This demonstrates a larger trend of arbitrariness in the enforcement of Twitter’s own policies in respect of takedowns in the Indian context. Not only are takedowns being effected without any notice to users, but in many cases, the post facto notice is not as per the terms of service. It appears that no specific details are provided to users either about offending content or about the legal demand.\nIt is clear that Twitter’s decisions on content regulation lack consistency with its own terms of service and practice, thereby undermining the transparency sought to be upheld by the platform. The lack of adequate notice — both in terms of it being prior to takedown and being sufficiently detailed — besides being arbitrary, virtually amounts to a ‘shadow banning’ of content. Such practices lack precision in enabling a user to regulate his own conduct or to seek any legal remedies.\nAccordingly, in the June 22 Letter, Mr. Singh urged Twitter to provide information in respect of the suspension of his account, @sushant_says on 01.02.2021 and 26.05.2021, respectively, including but not limited to the following:\n the basis of the takedown notice(s); if takedown was pursuant to a legal request from government/agencies under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, or any other legal provision, copies of the said legal requests and the objections/reply by Twitter through the process; if the takedown is pursuant to Twitter’s community guidelines and terms of service, details of specific provisions that are violated and reasons for the decision to regulate content; In any case, details of the offending tweets, duration of the suspension and reasons for restricting access to the account in entirety rather than blocking access to specific tweets.  We encourage an open discussion with Twitter Takedown of the content may be necessary in various situations to comply with applicable laws as well as to ensure that the platform protects the interests of its diverse users. At the same time, it is equally necessary to ensure that users responsible for that content are treated fairly throughout this process, so as to prevent the chilling of free speech and expression on the platform. In regulating content, Twitter performs a very important function and it must accept the degree of accountability and transparency that arises out of this function.\nIn its public statements, Twitter has claimed that “transparency is the foundation to promoting healthy public conversation on Twitter”. Therefore, in the June 22 Letter, we and Mr. Singh called upon the company to stand by those beliefs and have an open dialogue on its policy of taking down content pursuant to legal requests or in cases of suo motu action on account of violations of community guidelines. This will enable standardising and improving practices regarding takedowns, as well as strengthening the faith of users in Twitter’s practices.\nImportant Documents:  Sushant Singh’s letter to Twitter dated June 22, 2021 (link) Previous blogpost dated February 8, 2021 titled “Government censorship and the dire need for transparency” (link) Previous Blogpost dated May 10, 2021 titled ”MEITY responds to our representation to unblock Twitter accounts.

Considering its growing popularity, there is a need to survey its human rights due diligence. With over a million users from India alone regularly participating in Clubhouse discussion rooms, it is necessary that Clubhouse streamlines data protection and data processing practices and ensures the digital security of its users. In this post, we unfurl some of the key considerations the platform must include while fostering a robust human rights framework.\n               Background As India battled a vicious second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing its population to be burrowed indoors, Indian netizens found themselves an alternative to the roadside ‘addas’ in the form of Clubhouse, a social media platform that facilitates audio-only conversations between large groups of people without the hassle of meeting links or passwords. With the launch of its Android version in May 2021, India emerged as its top market, adding about 2.6 million users since its launch.\nConsidering the rise of Clubhouse, reports suggest that law enforcement agencies of the Indian Government, such as the National Investigative Agency, Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation, are monitoring conversations on the platform. We have filed a Right to Information application with the Government of India to determine the veracity of these reports.\nConcerns Emerge Independent of our efforts to seek transparency regarding the Government\u0026rsquo;s monitoring of Clubhouse, we are also concerned with the functioning of Clubhouse itself. For one, there is a rise in hate speech, disinformation and discriminatory commentary on the platform, against which the platform does not provide sufficient safeguards. There are also concerns with how respectful the platform is of user privacy. We believe that a social media platform rolled out in 2020 should have accounted for these concerns. This is because such platforms have observed how practices of organisations such as Facebook, have adversely impacted the digital rights of users. Thus, in this post, we express concerns with practices of Clubhouse and urge the platform to respect privacy, provide redressal against hate speech, and ensure due process and transparency when it censors content.\n Everything is not rosy at Clubhouse: When Clubhouse was initially rolled out, it did not have a privacy policy and even manipulated algorithmic discoverability tactics to access users’ personal data through invasive tracking mechanisms like cookies and pixel tags. As an aftermath of pushback from digital rights advocates, Clubhouse has come up with a privacy policy that delineates the gamut of information that they collect, use and share. However, concerns with its ability to secure users' data remain as recent reports indicate that scraped data of more than 1.3 million Clubhouse users was posted on a popular hacker forum. Data collection practices: A deeper dive into the privacy policy and data processing practices is necessary to assess how safe users’ data is with Clubhouse. The platform collects a wide array of information. This includes your name, email address, contact details, phone number, IP address, device name, operating system, the people you interact with and the time, frequency and duration of your use. Furthermore, Clubhouse facilitates easy one-step sign-on by allowing the users to synchronise their social media accounts to the platform. Thus, Clubhouse also accesses any personal information shared by the users on these platforms. Such excessive collection of data is against the principle of data minimisation which requires that Clubhouse only collects such personal information as is necessary to provide its services. Moreover, based on the specific authorisation, Clubhouse also collects phone numbers in your contact list even if those individuals are not on the platform. This undermines the right to informational privacy of those persons whose phone numbers get exposed to Clubhouse without their knowledge, let alone consent. Data Sharing practices: Clubhouse’s data sharing policies remain just as nebulous. It shares user data with vendors and service providers, business transferees as well as law enforcement agencies, if the need arises. Here again, the scope of consent and clarity on what data is being shared and for how long is lacking. This contravenes the principles of data minimisation and purpose limitation practises endorsed in global privacy law legislations. Moreover, while Clubhouse doesn’t sell information yet, there is no framework in place to prevent monetisation of data in the future. It recently also launched a pay for exclusive content feature which required users to subscribe to avail of exclusive content. Whether the rollout of this feature is in compliance with the application’s policy of not selling data is under scrutiny currently. Ambiguity over incident reporting, investigation and grievance redressal: Clubhouse temporarily records every conversation on its platform and purportedly retains them for the purposes of investigations, if a trust and safety complaint is raised during the live session. In case no complaints are made, recordings are deleted as soon as the session ends. However, the Community Guidelines does not clarify the constitution of the investigating team, the standard operating procedure the investigative team follows to address complaints and whether the recordings are removed entirely from every source once the investigation ends. There is further ambiguity around which part of the recording is retained for trust and safety concerns and if irrelevant information gets parsed from the same. For instance, if a non-muted participant forgets to leave the room, shall the recording capture even the non-related conversations of the said participant? Moreover, if complaints are raised post the session, it is unclear how Clubhouse will investigate them since recordings are deleted as soon as the session ends. Possibility of data spillage: While **** the conversations retained for investigations are protected by server-side encryption, regular conversations remain unprotected. Consequently, threats of plausible data leaks through vendors and back-end service providers persists. Concerns over Clubhouse’s data sharing practices were aggravated by a Stanford Internet Observatory report about alleged data spillage to a China based company which provides back-end support to Clubhouse. This augments the threat of state surveillance. While streamlined data protection legislations like the California Consumer Privacy Act, 2018 or the General Data Protection Regulation pertaining to EU countries enable due safeguards against any plausible misuse of data, in the absence of a data protection legislation in India, fear of the overreach of state interventions and subsequent persecution looms large.  Clubhouse should provide a Human Rights Policy and volunteer for a Civil Rights Audit As a platform that buttresses free and open conversations, Clubhouse is posited as an application that empowers many and facilitates democratic interactions between people across diverse socio-cultural milieu. At present, the Community Guidelines of Clubhouse reflect the intent to adhere to the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability of Content Moderation, 2018. But, as incidents of breaches grow, Clubhouse’s content moderation tactics would have to be evaluated according to these principles. Independent assessment of hate speech and disinformation needs to include systemic fixes in a way that trust and credibility is ensured in the review process.\nWe urge Clubhouse to provide a human rights policy. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Businesses and Human Rights require ‘business enterprises’ to maintain a minimum standard of human rights across jurisdictions. The policy will guide Clubhouse towards ensuring that it is respectful of digital rights as it grows and enable users to understand how the platform accounts for human rights in its governance of the platform. The policy should provide for an independent civil rights audit similar to the one Facebook volunteered for in the United States of America. The periodic audit will examine Clubhouse’s efforts to respect and defend human rights on its platform, evaluate how Clubhouse complies with its community guidelines and privacy policy, and provide its recommendations.\nWe believe that civil rights audits of social media entities are extremely important. In this day and age, these entities hold immense power in regulating speech and it is important that there is an independent evaluation of how such regulation takes place. A comprehensive human rights audit is the only way to mitigate the dual threat of hate \u0026amp; disinformation on the one hand and state/corporate surveillance on the other. As a new age social media platform, a robust and human rights compliant privacy policy is the first step towards making Clubhouse a more democratic and transparent space.\nImportant Documents\n Privacy Policy of Clubhouse, May 9, 2021 (link) Community Guidelines of Clubhouse, April 5, 2021 (link) Previous blog post titled ‘Examining Facebook’s Human Rights Policy ’, March 30, 2021 (link) Terms of Services of Clubhouse, May 5, 2021 (link) Boom Report titled Inside Clubhouse India: Is it the new ground for polarisation, June 18, 2021 (link) Quint Report titled Govt Prying on Clubhouse Rooms, Violating App’s Terms of Services, June 14, 2021 (link) Santa Clara Principles, February 2018 (link) United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/clubhouse-how-safe-really-is-this-safe-space/","summary":"In this post, we unfurl some of the key considerations Clubhouse must include while fostering a robust human rights framework for its rapidly growing millions of users.","title":"ClubHouse: How safe really is this 'safe space'?"},{"content":"            tl;dr In this explainer, we will be looking at emotion recognition technology and how it works as well as the issues related to its usage by different authorities. We will also be looking at the rights which are involved in this scenario as well as any laws in place to regulate its use and misuse.\nWhat is emotion recognition technology? In the short-lived but extremely engaging television series, “Lie to me”, the protagonist is the world\u0026rsquo;s leading deception expert who studies facial expressions and involuntary body language to identify when a person is lying. He does this by studying “micro-expressions”, which are said to be involuntary facial expressions that last on a person’s face for a short time that give away their actual feelings before the person masks these feelings in an attempt to deceive or lie.\nThe protagonist of this show was based on and inspired by the real life work of American psychologist Paul Ekman, who is renowned for having come up with a theory of universal emotions which holds that, “(o)f all the human emotions we experience, there are seven universal emotions that we all feel, transcending language, regional, cultural, and ethnic differences”. This theory identifies seven universal facial expressions for these emotions, which are anger, disgust, fear, surprise, happiness, sadness and contempt, and is the basis for most of the recent development in artificial intelligence (AI) based emotion recognition technology.\nEmotion recognition technology uses AI to identify and categorise emotions into these seven universal emotions or a combination thereof based on facial expressions __ it perceives from the subject and is used in conjunction with facial recognition technology. We recently came across this technology when the Lucknow Police announced its intention to use emotion recognition technology to track expressions of “distress” on the faces of women who come under the gaze of the AI enabled cameras in public places. The cameras would then automatically alert the nearest police station even before the woman in question takes any action to report any issue herself. Another troubling instance of the use of this technology was when a Chinese subsidiary of Japanese camera maker Canon, Canon Information Technology, last year unveiled a new workspace management system that only allows smiling employees to enter the office and book conference rooms.\nWhy is it an issue? “Emotion-recognition systems share a similar set of blueprints and founding assumptions: that there is a small number of distinct and universal emotional categories, that we involuntarily reveal these emotions on our faces, and that they can be detected by machines.” However, the biggest criticism levelled against the use of emotion recognition technology is that facial expressions do not accurately correspond to a person’s emotional state. A number of factors play an important role in displaying how a person is feeling which includes body language, tone of voice, changes in skin tone, personality as well as the context in which these emotions are generated and expressed. These factors, however, cannot be recognised by the technology thereby making it difficult for it to be accurate. It is also important to note here that while facial recognition technology, which is used in conjunction with emotion recognition technology, can theoretically be developed to be more accurate, complete accuracy in emotion recognition technology cannot be achieved. The game linked below will help you to experience how emotion recognition works and how easy it is to hoodwink the technology.\nEmojify Is emotion recognition technology “emojifying” you?     This is because the science behind emotion recognition, i.e., the theory of universal emotions itself has been at the receiving end of criticism. After reviewing more than 1,000 studies, a group of scientists brought together by the Association for Psychological Science, concluded that the relationship between facial expression and emotion is nebulous, convoluted and far from universal. Emotion recognition also stems, in part, from the problematic pseudo-science of physiognomy, which purports to judge a person’s character from their facial features or expressions. The idea behind physiognomy was that, “if you looked like an animal, say, a sheep, you also had its personality”. This philosophy of basically judging a book by its cover, was seen to be wildly racist and was largely discredited in the 15th century. However, a few fringe “experts” continued to work on it and developed linkages with criminology like the criminologist Cesare Lombroso, who “argued that you could pick a criminal out of a crowd by analyzing their features”. (Read a brief history of physiognomy here)\nHowever, use of emotion recognition is still picking up pace and the emotion detection industry is projected to almost double from $19.5bn in 2020 to $37.1bn by 2026. Use cases for emotion recognition have been propping consistently in the past year such as use by/for:\n Police; Hiring processes; Workplace surveillance; Classroom monitoring and Mass surveillance.  However, use of emotion recognition technology by the Police or similar agencies has been criticised for displaying racial bias. Use of emotion recognition has also been criticised when utilised for hiring purposes as it leads to a certain candidates, such as those who are visibly nervous or conversing in their second language, being unfairly disadvantaged.\nDo we have a right to privacy for our emotions? The question that arises next is are emotions protected under the right to privacy? Privacy includes bodily integrity, personal autonomy, informational self-determination, protection from state surveillance, dignity, confidentiality, compelled speech and freedom to dissent or move or think. In short, the right to privacy has to be determined on a case-by-case basis.If we assume that privacy is about exercising the choice to withhold information, which others have no need to know, then emotions can be categorised as protected under the right to privacy.\nAdditionally, under the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, biometric data, which is classified as sensitive personal data, is defined as, “facial images, fingerprints, iris scans, or any other similar personal data resulting from measurements or technical processing operations carried out on physical, physiological, or behavioural characteristics of a data principal, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person”. Thus, it can be surmised that we do have a right to privacy for our emotions and thus any intrusion into it, at least by the State, has to satisfy the thresholds of legality, necessity and proportionality as per the decision of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court of India in the Right to Privacy judgment.\nImportant Documents  Our #DataProtectionTop10 series (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/emotion-recognition-technology-an-explainer/","summary":"Wondering where emotion recognition originated and what it entails?

Supreme Court of India and others.\nIn that petition, it was argued that the right to seek and receive information including live streaming of proceedings from the Supreme Court is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution; the move will strengthen public confidence in the Judiciary by furthering transparency and the principle of Open Justice; and that recording and live streaming the proceedings of cases of public importance would completely negate the chances of any misreporting\nThese arguments were accepted by the Supreme Court, which held that open trials and access to the public during hearing of cases before the Court is an accepted proposition, and that live streaming of Court proceedings can allow the public to witness live court proceedings.\nWhat’s in the Rules The Draft Live-Streaming Rules contemplate setting up hardware and software capabilities for the live streaming of judicial proceedings, as well as laying down the guidelines for such streaming. In a commendable step, this will be applicable to all courts in India, including all district courts of India, and not just the High Courts and Supreme Court.\nThe Draft Live-Streaming Rules also state that all proceedings in all courts will be Live-Streamed, unless they fall within one of the following exceptions:\n Matrimonial matters; Cases concerning sexual offences and/or gender-based violence against women; Matters registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) and under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015; In-camera proceedings; Matters where the Bench is of the view, for reasons to be recorded in writing, that publication would be antithetical to the administration of justice; Cases that may provoke enmity amongst communities, and are thus likely to result in a breach of law and order; Recording of evidence, including cross-examination; Privileged communications between the parties and their advocates and non-public discussions between advocates; and Any other matter in which a specific direction is issued by the Bench or the Chief Justice.  This may seem like a large number of exceptions have been carved out, but it still leaves almost all criminal and civil matters available for streaming. All constitutional matters and matters of public interest will now be streamed under the Rules, though it is clarified that streaming may sometimes be restricted to final arguments only.\nWhere the cases are not live streamed, video recordings of the proceedings will still be made for the exclusive use of the Court and for any Appellate stages that the case may reach. However, no guidelines for the safety and privacy of such recordings have been provided. This is of particular concern, because this includes sensitive cases such as those involving sexual offences and gender-based violence, where maintaining confidentiality is of utmost importance. It’s also worth notice that India does not yet have a data protection legal regime. The Draft Live-Streaming Rules do clarify that in criminal matters, the testimony of victims and witnesses will be maintained in the Recordings via dummy names, face-masking, pixelation and/or electronic distortion of voice. However, this is subject to the logistical and technical capability of the Court. There is no guidance for when a Court is unable to secure such solutions to protect anonymity for victims and witnesses. Ideally, in these scenarios, the Rules should clarify that if the victim’s or witnesses’ identity cannot be protected by use of such measures, then the Court shall not make and save recordings of Court proceedings.\nAll parties and their lawyers will be informed before the beginning of the proceedings that the proceedings will be live streamed, and they will have an opportunity to object to the live streaming at any stage of the proceedings, including if they initially agreed to the proceedings being live streamed. The final decision will, however, rest with the judges, and this decision cannot be appealed.\nThe Live-Streaming Rules also lay down what will NOT be recorded in proceedings which are live streamed The Live-Streaming Rules have also identified certain aspects of proceedings that are not to be recorded or streamed, such as discussions amongst judges; instructions given by a judge to the administrative staff; any communication/message/document given by the Court Master to the Bench; notes made by judges and advocates; and communication between the advocate and client, inter-se the advocates, and communications which is not a submission exchanged between the advocate and the Court. In such cases, the monitor will display the message: “Live-streaming paused as per applicable Rules”.\nPersonal information such as dates of birth, home addresses, identity card numbers, bank account information, etc. will be deleted or muted during streaming. The advocates and litigants-in-person can also request the judges to redact personal and sensitive information from the recording.\nAudio-video recording or recording of Proceedings by any other means is expressly prohibited. This means that only the cameras installed pursuant to these Rules can be used. No media or news channels can bring their cameras for recording purposes, nor can individual persons in the Court switch on their phone cameras to take recordings. The Court’s live stream can also not be transmitted, modified or re-published in any form at all. Doing so can invite prosecution under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and/or the Indian Copyright Act, 1957.\nHardware will need to be upgraded at all our Courts Coming to the logistics of how this will be achieved; the Courtroom will have cameras covering at least five angles: one towards the judges, two towards the advocates, one towards the accused (if any) and one towards any witnesses that may be called to Court. The judge will be provided a remote control and the power to pause/stop the live stream at any point. Technical experts will also be present in each court room, to enable the live streaming.\nA dedicated control room is sought to be established in every Court, with a team of technical experts, supervised by the Registrar (IT), who will monitor Court Proceedings and ensure that nothing “uncivil or inappropriate” is streamed in the public domain. The Draft Live-Streaming Rules have not defined or clarified what is meant by “uncivil or inappropriate”, and this appears to be vague and open to interpretation by the technical team at the control room.\nThe recordings of the live-streamed proceedings will also be saved and stored (for at least six months) on the Court’s website. This is to be done within three days of the conclusion of the proceedings. However, there will be a delay of ten minutes in the transmission of the live-stream. The Live-Streaming Rules do not specify why this delay requirement has been inserted in the Rules, but a good assumption is that this is to enable the dedicated control room and the technical experts to determine which parts of the recordings can be streamed, and which parts are to be redacted.\nImpacts/Concerns All in all, this is a hugely welcome step, and we are in strong support of the move to stream legal proceedings live. This will boost transparency, accountability, foster public trust in the justice delivery institutions, and go a long way in improving the legal literacy of the general public. It is indicative of the e-Committee’s commitment to work towards bringing overall improvements to the judiciary.\nHowever, any such move must properly achieve the balance between privacy and the public interest. In our opinion, small amendments are still required to improve this balance, though we are cognisant that the Live-Streaming Rules have made a clear and mindful attempt to strike such a balance.\n Tighten the language to avoid arbitrariness: For example, Rule 3.2 that requires the DCR to ensure that nothing “uncivil or inappropriate” is streamed in the public needs to be tightened and language needs to be clarified. It cannot be left to the discretion of technical experts to decide what is uncivil and what is inappropriate. The Rules can be much more clear on laying down the standards for this. Tighter protections for victims/witnesses: In cases where anonymity of victims and witnesses cannot be maintained in the recordings via dummy names, face-masking, pixelation and/or electronic distortion of voice for reasons of technical glitches or logistical failures, there is no guidance on how the DCR is to proceed. It should be clarified that the proceedings will be adjourned until such issues are resolved. Otherwise, technical staff may proceed with the recording without adequate protections. 10 minute delay in streaming: Similarly, the requirement for there to be a ten-minute delay in streaming under Rule 8.3.i. also does not provide any standards or objectives sought to be achieved by such delay. The delay may well serve the legitimate purpose of ensuring that no inappropriate content is streamed, but without clear guidelines on how the time is to be used, such a provision is open to misuse. No provision to secure personal data: Since the recordings concern legal proceedings of individual litigants, including criminal proceedings, they are likely to contain sensitive personal data. In fact, even the participation of an individual in a criminal trial may in itself be sensitive information. While the Rules include detailed provisions for what sort of information has to be screened from streaming publicly, they are less clear on what sort of information can be screened from recording at all. Since all recordings are to be saved for at least six months under Rule 7.4, there also needs to be clarity on how this data will be secured. This is of particular concern since India does not have a data protection regime. Extensive efforts required to put rules in practice: Finally, since the Live-Streaming Rules also apply to all district and sessions courts in rural India, special care is required during the implementation of the Rules to upgrade and upkeep the electronic infrastructure there. A whole team of technical experts will be required for every courtroom in every court house in every local jurisdiction in India. This will require an extensive recruitment and training exercise, which will be crucial in the operationalisation of the Live-Streaming Rules.  Please give your comments!

We filed RTIs to find out what was stated in the letter, and today (June 17, 2021) we were provided copies of two letters from MeitY to Twitter dated May 21 and 25, 2021. The letters do not cite any provision of law, but have asked Twitter to refrain from implementing its policy and process of affixing the ‘Manipulated Media’ tag on tweets.\nBackground According to media reports, we learned that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has issued a letter to Twitter seeking removal of the “Manipulated Media” tag affixed by Twitter on certain tweets made by Indian political leaders. In those tweets, the political leaders are attributing a ‘toolkit’ to a political party. The Ministry reportedly objected to the tagging because law enforcement agencies are investigating the veracity of the ‘toolkit’.\nTo ensure that speech over social media is not unreasonably curbed, we wrote to MeitY detailing our concerns. In the letter, we urged MeitY to publish true copies of these letters on the official website of MeitY, seek legal opinion from the Ministry of Law and Justice on this issue, and in the interim withdraw these letters.\nAt the same time, we filed two RTIs applications before the Department of Electronics and Information Technology at MeitY on May 21, 2021 and June 2, 2021, where we asked the following questions:\n whether any governmental authorities have been in contact with Twitter for any tweets related to the alleged Congress Toolkit; whether any governmental authorities have issued any directions to Twitter to remove the manipulated media tag on tweets related to the alleged Congress Toolkit; and what is the provision of law under which the directions for removing the manipulated media tag from the tweets related to the alleged Congress Toolkit were issued  We had also requested to be provided with copies of any communication(s) that may have been sent to Twitter by MeitY. We received a reply to our RTI request today, i.e. June 17, 2021, confirming that MeitY did indeed issue letters to Twitter asking Twitter to remove the ‘Manipulated Media’ tag. The reply from MeitY contained two letters issued by the MeitY to Twitter requesting certain action on part of Twitter in relation to its ‘manipulated media’ tags.\nThe RTI reply also stated that under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 MeitY is the administrator of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and deals with all matters relating to the internet including grievances and clarifications from intermediaries - this is not however specifically stated in the Allocation of Business Rules. The Supreme Court in a long line of decisions has interpreted the Allocation of Business Rules as being administrative in nature, which only deal with role division between various government ministries and departments, and no powers actually arise under such rules.\nMeitY’s response to the RTIs has provided the letters MeitY issued to Twitter We are grateful to MeitY for actually disclosing the letters it has issued to Twitter. This is a crucial step towards promoting transparency and accountability, which is absolutely essential for fostering greater public trust in our institutions. However, we are concerned about the content of the two letters.\nThe first letter issued by MeitY dated May 21, 2021 to Twitter (the May 21 Letter), noted that Twitter had tagged certain tweets as ‘manipulated media’. MeitY claimed that the ‘toolkit’ referred to in the tweets in question was under investigation by law enforcement agencies, and alleged that such tagging by Twitter was “pre-judged, prejudiced and a deliberate attempt to colour the investigation” by the law enforcement agency. MeitY, accordingly, asked Twitter to remove the ‘Manipulated Media’ tag as applied to certain tweets.\nWhile we do not have a copy of Twitter’s response to the May 21 Letter, it appears that Twitter replied to the May 21 Letter, outlining its policy regarding synthetic and manipulated media. References are made to this response in MeitY’s second letter dated May 25, 2021 to Twitter (the May 25 Letter).\nIn the May 25 Letter, MeitY acknowledged Twitter’s policies and claimed that such policies were opaque and violated the principles of natural justice, since the users whose tweets have been tagged as ‘manipulated media’ did not receive an opportunity to be heard before the tagging. MeitY also reiterated that the tagging of the tweets carrying the alleged toolkit as ‘manipulated media’ would colour ongoing investigations. This time, however, MeitY requested Twitter to entirely stop the practice of tagging tweets as ‘manipulated media’, at least during the pendency of this particular investigation.\nNo provision of law was cited by MeitY The two letters did not cite any provision under which such requests were made. We reiterate the concern we have raised previously that such letters are not anchored in any provision of law. Nothing in the IT Act, 2000 or the Rules made thereunder empowers MeitY to request Twitter to take down such tags, or to entirely stop affixing such tags to posts. The law also does not prohibit Twitter from affixing such tags.\nMoreover, the actions of Twitter align with Twitter’s ‘Synthetic and Manipulated Media Policy’. This policy permits Twitter to affix a tag if it finds that the content has been substantially edited or if the content is shared deceptively. The fact that a law enforcement agency is investigating the veracity of the toolkit referred to in the tweets does not prevent Twitter from tagging content on its platform. It is not clear how such tagging affects any independent ongoing investigation, but in the event that such tagging affects any ongoing investigation, it is the law enforcement agency and not the Ministry that should take steps.\nWe previously understood that MeitY had only asked Twitter to remove the ‘Manipulated Media’ tag from certain tweets, but the RTI response has now revealed that MeitY has gone one step further in the May 25 Letter and asked Twitter to put their entire ‘Synthetic and Manipulated Media Policy’ on hold, at least until the investigation process is completed. Such requests have come without any legal basis or legal authority. In its letters to Twitter or in the RTI response to us, MeitY has not cited or made reference to any provision of law from which the authority to prevent or restrain an intermediary from fighting disinformation is derived. The Allocation of Business Rules only list the matters in respect of which the Ministry is responsible. It does not grant the power to impose restrictions on private companies in the absence of authorising legal provisions.\nAdditionally, MeitY’s powers under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the rules framed thereunder are limited to ordering the take down of unlawful content and other such similar powers. While it is true that Twitter’s content regulation policies need to be much more transparent and consistently applied, including the policy regarding labelling tweets as ‘Manipulated Media’, MeitY does not have the power to tell social media platforms how to govern their platforms in this specific manner, particularly as such companies have a statutory requirement to take measures to curb fake news and disinformation from being spread on their platforms.\nThis is of grave concern, especially as MeitY pushes through the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 with the stated aim of fighting and curbing disinformation and fake news on social media platforms. At the same time, MeitY is issuing correspondence to Twitter to stop its disinformation fighting processes. This appears to be doublespeak and will erode public trust in the government’s commitment to fighting fake news and disinformation.\nImportant Documents  MeitY’s letter dated May 21, 2021 asking Twitter to remove the ‘manipulated media’ tag from certain (link) MeitY’s letter dated May 25, 2021 asking Twitter to stop the process of tagging tweets as manipulated media altogether (link) IFF’s letter dated May 22, 2021 asking MEITY to withdraw the letters (link) Previous blogpost dated 22 May 2021 titled “MEITY has no legal basis to ask social media platforms to remove content in middle of India\u0026rsquo;s COVID crisis!” (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/revealed-rti-request-uncovers-meity-letters-to-twitter-asking-to-remove-the-manipulated-media-tag/","summary":"We were provided copies of two letters from MeitY to Twitter, which do not cite any provision of law, but have asked Twitter to refrain from implementing its policy and process of affixing the ‘Manipulated Media’ tag on tweets.","title":"Revealed: RTI Request uncovers MeitY letters to Twitter asking to remove the ‘manipulated media’ tag"},{"content":"            Tl;dr Along with the Centre for Health Equity, Law, and Policy, we have drafted a working paper analysing the National Digital Health Mission’s Health Data Management Policy. We will be explaining our analysis of the Policy in a two part series. This post provides an introduction to the issue, discusses the various prerequisites required for implementing a robust digital health records system, and looks at the governance structure underlying the Policy.\nIntroduction On August 20th last year, the National Health Authority had issued a press release announcing the public consultation for the Draft Health Data Management Policy (HDMP) for the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). We had provided legal support to a petition that challenged the consultation process for the HDMP. After hearing the petition, the Delhi High Court directed the government to consider the consultation process in accordance with existing policies such as the Pre-legislative Consultation Policy, after which the government extended the deadline to September 21st, 2020. However, several issues remained, such as the inaccessibility for persons with visual impairments as well as the online-only and english-only mode of consultation. Thus, we wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare regarding these issues.\nSubsequently, we also submitted our comments on the HDMP. Our comments centred on the following themes:\n Lack of data protection legislation: Ensuring health data privacy requires legislation at three levels- comprehensive laws, sectoral laws and informal rules. Since the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is still pending in Parliament, the Draft Policy can at best be considered a set of informal rules which lack any statutory basis. UNAIDS has also emphasized that national level privacy legislation is necessary to address privacy concerns associated with national health IDs. De facto mandatory nature of Digital Health ID Programme: As reported by various media publications, registration for a health ID under the NDHM may be voluntary on paper but it is being made mandatory in practice by hospital administrators and heads of departments. The de facto mandatory nature of the digital health ID programme under NDHM can be addressed only if it supported by an underlying legislation which clearly places a bar on denial of healthcare services because of lack of a digital health ID, and prescribes strict penalties for erring government officials who make use of such health IDs mandatory. Linkage of Aadhaar with Digital Health ID: The use of Aadhaar for the purposes of authentication of identity at the time of registration raises serious privacy concerns about linkage of a person’s health data with other databases, and it increases the likelihood of the National Digital Health Ecosystem being connected with systems beyond the health sector. Additionally, the non-inclusion of official identifiers like Aadhaar number within the definition of sensitive personal data under the Draft Policy is inconsistent with the government’s own Personal Data Protection Bill and may lead to inadequate protection being provided to Aadhaar details shared by participants in NDHM. Risk of re-identification of anonymized data: The Draft Policy does not adequately address concerns about reidentification of de-identified or anonymized health data which is now widely understood to be a real threat. For instance, researchers have been able to re-identify 43% of known patients by matching de-identified data sets against news reports. Researchers have also found that 87% of the population in the United States can be uniquely identified based on only three characteristics - ZIP, gender, date of birth - and proven that any data set which includes these highly identifying characteristics cannot not be considered anonymized. Threat of data breaches: Executives in the healthcare sector have recognized the cybersecurity risks posed by the NDHM. Further, India has a past record of breaches of sensitive personal data like financial information. For instance, in 2016, 3.2 million debit cards were recalled by various banks due to a data breach. Any similar leak of sensitive health data collected as part of NDHM would cause severe and irreparable harm to millions of citizens which cannot be quantified or compensated in monetary terms. For this reason, it is essential that independent technical experts are provided more time to thoroughly scrutinize the National Digital Health Ecosystem’s technical design and there should be full disclosure of all information that is necessary to conduct such an independent evaluation.  Our Working Paper On 14th December 2020, the government approved the final version of the HDMP. Throughout the past year, we have engaged with the emerging health data paradigms, and so we set about analysing the HDMP. To this extent, given our lack of domain expertise, we collaborated with various key stakeholders such as public health groups and health policy experts. Our main collaborator in these endeavours was the Centre for Health Equity, Law, and Policy, with whom we jointly organised an internal stakeholder conference to discuss the various aspects of the HDMP.\nWe are now able to finally present to you the fruits of our joint labour on the HDMP; our working paper ‘Analysing the NDHM Health Data Management Policy’. In a two part series, we will be explaining our paper in detail. This post will discuss the essential prerequisites required for implementing a digital health records system, while also taking a look at the governance system proposed by the HDMP.\nPrerequisites for a Digital Health Records System To implement an digital health records system adequately, two fundamental prerequisites are required:\n A robust legal foundation: The NDHM-HDMP seeks to digitise health records and link these records with a digital health ID, entailing significant risks to confidentiality and privacy. A study on identity management systems in Europe describes UHIDs as ‘one of the most privacy-invasive tools of eHealth’, especially because of the potential of linking health data with other data sources. For example, the use of Aadhaar to create a UHID can be linked with other personal information, creating the potential for state surveillance and profiling for commercial purposes. A recent RTI query revealed that the chief medical officer of the Kulgam district in Jammu and Kashmir was sharing Aarogya Setu users’ data (without the users’ knowledge and consent) with local police authorities. Apart from this, identity fraud, data theft and reidentification are some other risks posed by a digital health ID. In January 2021, a technology portal reported leaking of COVID-19 test results and personal information of thousands of patients, from the websites of multiple Indian government departments. Such breaches can cause embarrassment, humiliation, loss of reputation and stigmatization of individuals, especially vulnerable populations; and unregulated access by third parties can lead to discrimination against individuals, such as denial of insurance and discrimination at workplace. Furthermore, without any statutory foundation and an independent regulatory authority, establishing and implementing a digital health records system; and sharing data with government bodies and private entities across different digital technology products, services and applications, risks fundamental rights to informed consent, confidentiality and privacy. Such an action may be contrary to the Constitution of India. State capacity: Apart from a robust legal foundation, successful implementation of a digital health records system entails health system preparedness, i.e. an assessment of existing capacities for medical record documentation and health information exchange. The WHO recommends governments to do the groundwork on evaluating the state of healthcare documentation for data standardisation and accuracy, technical infrastructure capabilities, availability of skilled human resources and training for data entry and analysis, protocols for ensuring privacy, security and adequate quality of data, and other environmental issues like electricity and internet speed. Pushing the implementation of digital health without adequately taking into account and planning for these requirements will cause more harm than any stated benefit of digitization. Some studies, evaluating existing health information systems in India in India, find several deficiencies particularly in relation to the quality of data being recorded. Poor internet connectivity, long power outages and lack of technical support led to delays in recording data, as well as many cases going unrecorded altogether. A digital health records system has the potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and quality of healthcare. The success of such a system is contingent upon its widespread acceptability and reusability. However, implementing the system at a national level is a complex process, and requires strategic planning and stakeholder engagement. Hasty implementation without adequate safeguards not only risks the privacy and security of medical data, as well as exclusion and inequities; but it may also undermine general trust in the system leading to low uptake.  Governance framework The key features of the governance framework envisaged under the NDHM-HDMP, are enumerated below:\n The governance structure will be the same as that for the National Digital Health Ecosystem (NDHE), and will be specified by NDHM. The National Digital Health Blueprint envisages that the NDHM will facilitate the evolution of NDHE, including establishing and implementing the National Health Electronic Registries and the Electronic Health Records Framework. The NDHB provides that the NDHM will be a government owned body comprising two separate arms: (a) governing council and board of directors responsible for policy formulation and regulation; and (b) CEO and operations team responsible for implementation of the policies. In addition to this, the NDHM-HDMP provides that the governance structure will consist of committees, authorities and officers at different levels. Specifically, it will consist of a data protection officer (NDHM-DPO) and a grievance redressal officer (NDHM-GRO). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology will provide overall guidance. Specific details in relation to the governance structure will be stipulated from time to time.  Although there is some clarity on the structure of NDHM, the NDHM-HDMP is silent on the size, composition, selection process, tenure, powers, functions, terms of removal, financing and the accountability framework governing NDHM. In effect, the governance structure of NDHM will be laid out by NDHM itself. This may lead to problems associated with excessive delegation, especially lack of transparency and a weak accountability framework. The appointment of government officers as the NDHM CEO and NDHM-DPO is also not desirable. The two members are responsible for implementing the UHID and EHR system, including the collection, management and sharing of health data. Government officers holding these key positions may expose the NDHM to pressures from the government and compromise its independence.\nNext, the HDMP also lays out the grievance redress and enforcement framework. Ideally, a grievance redress mechanism should entail clear processes embedded in the rule of law, through which aggrieved parties can seek redress or challenge regulatory actions. Unfortunately, the grievance redress process contained in the NDHM-HDMP falls short on this count. As the HDMP provides data fiduciaries (entities that collect and store data) with significant amounts of discretion with respect to handling complaints, data principals face the risk of arbitrary rejection of complaints. As an example, one of the most common complaints against Indian health insurance companies, who are free to lay down their own procedure for settlement of insurance claims, is the rejection of claims without any reasoning. In order to avoid a similar problem, the NDHM-HDMP should lay down the procedure for the receipt and redress of complaints at all levels.\nData fiduciaries are also obligated to formulate and implement a personal data breach management procedure, for monitoring instances of non-compliance or unauthorised use. The provision can be strengthened in the following ways:\n Data fiduciaries should be obligated to disclose all information and any material change to the information on the personal data breach management procedure, directly to the user. This information should be presented in a legible and reasonably plain language to the user. Any instances of breach should not only be notified to NDHM, but also the user affected by such breach.  Finally, the NDHM-HDMP prescribes penalties for non-compliance. These include a ban from participating in the NDHE, and suspension or cancellation of digital IDs of health professionals and health facilities. While the NDHM-HDMP envisages various degrees of possible contraventions, the penalties are limited to a ban, suspension or cancellation of the digital health ID. This may lead to situations where either minor violations go completely unpunished or a large number of penalties are disproportionate to the violation. Both scenarios will undermine implementation of the NDHM-HDMP. Hence, there is a need for rationalisation of the penalty system. This may be achieved through the incorporation of a graded system of penalties for violations based on the cause of the violation, with penalties ranging from warnings, corrective actions and monetary penalties to suspension, cancellation and instituting criminal proceedings. This would ensure that the enforcement mechanism is embedded in the rule of law and in line with the principle of proportionality.\nIn the next post, we will look at other issues related to consent and confidentiality, data privacy and security, inclusion, and private sector access to health data.\nImportant Documents  The National Digital Health Mission’s Health Data Management Policy (link) IFF and C-HELP Working Paper: ‘Analysing the NDHM Health Data Management Policy’ (link)  We would like to once again thank the Centre for Health Equity, Law, and Policy for all their help and support on this paper.

In our comments, we highlighted the issues with indirect incentives that illustrated the need for direct performance based incentives. Additionally, we spoke about issues with public wifi networks that hadn’t been adequately addressed and argued for the use of subsidies over direct benefit transfers.\nIntroductions In October last year, we submitted our comments on the Telecom Regulatory Authority’s (TRAI’s) Consultation Paper on Roadmap to Promote Broadband Connectivity and Enhanced Broadband Speed. Our submissions were centred around 2 main issues:\n Updating the current definition of broadband: The existing definition of ‘broadband’ is inadequate and may need revision to account for download and upload speeds. This would help overcome any attempts by ISP’s to reduce access to the internet by restricting and throttling upload speeds and help bring about a fuller advancement of user rights. Thus, we suggested that ‘broadband’ be defined as: Broadband is a data connection that is able to support interactive services including Internet access and has the capability of providing download and upload speeds which fall into one of the four categories mentioned herein to an individual subscriber from the point of presence (POP) of the service provider intending to provide Broadband service. The four categories of broadband speed are: _1. Normal - 512 KBp/s to 2 MBp/s download speed , 256 KBp/s to 1 MBp/s upload speed;_2. Good - 2 MBp/s to 20 MBp/s download speed , 1 MBp/s to 10 MBp/s upload speed__3. Fast - 20 MBp/s to 50 MBp/s download speed , 10 MBp/s to 25 MBp/s upload speed__4. Superfast - 50 MBp/s download speed and above, 25 MBp/s upload speed and above Developing digital infrastructure: Alongside policy level changes, there is a need to develop digital infrastructure in a manner in which constant updation and revolutionsing is possible. Thus, we had submitted the ‘Dig Smart' model of public-private partnerships for creating broadband infrastructure, wherein the government would install the conduits wherever there was a need for public works network construction and subsequently lease out the conduits to broadband service providers.  With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world has been forced to recalibrate the everyday activities into the online mode. From our professional commitments to educational needs, from interpersonal communications to shopping, almost every facet of our social media functions have now been co-opted to the virtual world. Predictably, the relevance of online platforms for a multitude of activities shall continue in the near future which in turn necessitates access to reliable and affordable internet services for every citizen of the country. Given that the transformative milieu of digital communications is the driving force in today’s society, we must ensure that the benefits of high speed broadband are not limited to only a certain section of the society.\nThe Supreme Court of India, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, has also highlighted that the internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights provided by the Constitution of India. This is echoed in the Department of Telecommunications’ “National Digital Communications Policy, 2018” and the PM-WANI scheme which promotes, “Broadband for All as a tool for socio-economic development, while ensuring service quality and environmental sustainability.” We must ensure that broadband infrastructure caters not only to needs based on connectivity and geography but also serves to alleviate sections of the society who have traditionally not been able to enjoy the benefits of access to the internet.\nRecommendations\nOur submissions were based on the following core points:\n Issues with indirect incentives and the misappropriation of revenue: We submitted that for the purpose of incentivising the proliferation of fixed line broadband networks, providing indirect incentives to the licensees can lead to several issues, misappropriation of revenues being the most prominent among them. Indirect incentives fail to guarantee that ISP’s would invest the increased monies into expanding the user base, especially in rural and far flung areas. This is because indirect incentives provide licensees with significant amounts of discretionary power, as the very nature of indirect incentives allows licenses to choose how to deploy increased resources. It would not be unreasonable to expect ISPs and telecom companies to channelise the surplus revenues from licence fee exemptions to clearing their outstanding AGR dues rather than investing on expanding the user base. The need for direct performance linked incentives: As an alternative to licence fee exemptions, we see direct performance linked incentives as a more effective incentive mechanism. There is evidence based merit in opting for post facto incentives based on the growth of the user base as the indisputable metric to determine the benefits of direct benefits. Direct incentives provide a concrete pathway towards increasing the user base. Direct incentives, if linked to investment, also provide a good boost to capital expenditure in the sector, thus enabling the development of infrastructure in under-serviced areas. Key problems with public wifi networks: The biggest threat posed by the public wifi networks is the immense potential of data breaches and violation of the citizens’ right to privacy. Public Wi-Fis are known to be susceptible to attacks and breaches, especially in the absence of data protection norms. The security architecture used in public Wi-Fis may often not possess sufficient security standards, and so may leak data. Furthermore, many websites, including government portals, may not always have security credentials such as HTTPS or SSL certificates, and so accessing such websites through public Wi-Fis may be even more dangerous. In absence of a robust and comprehensive data protection law, the deregulated environment of internet usage including both usage data and any personal or sensitive information entered for the purpose of authentication runs the risk of compromising the security of one’s personal data. We also highlight that in the installation of small cell wifi infrastructure, it must be ensured that not only is high speed internet connectivity provided, but also that it is done so at low rates to facilitate ease of access for all. For this purpose, only public sector players must be deployed since private sector players stakeholders often do not have the economic viability to offer affordable rates. Subsidies over Direct benefit transfers(DBT): We highlighted the benefits of usage-linked subsidies over the direct benefit transfers to promote the proliferation of broadband services. There are several structural issues with direct benefit transfers including lack of infrastructure, difficulties in identifying beneficiaries, influence of local power brokers over DBT deliveries, DBT schemes have not been envisioned to be accompanied by an expansion of state services to provide low cost supply boosts and finally, economic factors like threats of inflationary pressures. We recommend that direct subsidies be provided that would involve subsiding the monthly packs purchased by subscribers, along with accompanying subsidies for installation charges incurred.

As a result of these breaches, data of Indian users is available to any third party over the internet for nefarious use. We have addressed a representation dated 11th June 2021 to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (“MEITY”). In the representation, we have provided a range of recommendations to prevent and provide redressal against data breaches. We have also affixed along with the representation, a set of concrete recommendations to Air India Limited by Mr Suman Kar. Mr Kar is the founder of Banbreach and has expertise in cybersecurity consulting, digital forensics and incident response.\nBackground\nOn 10th June 2021, we came across reports which claimed that data of 15 crores vaccinated Indians had been breached. Thankfully, cyber-security researchers subsequently verified that the breach had not taken place. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also assured that the data on the CoWin portal was safe but nevertheless asked the Computer Emergency Response Team (“CERT-IN”) to investigate the issue. While we can breathe easily for now, this signals our worst fears. We do not have a robust data protection regime to respond to the rise in data breaches.\nA data breach exposes confidential, sensitive and protected information to unauthorised persons. As a result of data breaches, data of Indian users is available to any third party over the internet for nefarious use. The table below, which is based on publicly available information, illustrates the frequency, scale and threat posed by data breaches. Reports also indicate that data breaches affecting Indian users have been on a rise. The economic impact of data breaches is also tremendous. An IBM study reported, the average data breach in India cost Rs 14 crore an increase of 9.4% from 2014. The per-unit data cost increased by 10% to Rs 5,522. The report also noted that the average time to both detect and contain a breach went up from 221 days to 230 days and from 77 to 83 days respectively.\nPreviously, we had written to CERT-IN on 31st March 2021 and 8th April 2021 asking them to investigate data breaches affecting Indian users of MobiKwik and Facebook. However, in our opinion, CERT-IN did not respond in a robust manner and we will be following this up with further advocacy actions in the near future. We also kept coming across reports of new data breaches, including the one reported by the Government of India owned Air India Limited. Thus, we examined the legal framework and felt that there was a need to suggest substantive changes.\n    Air India: your data up in the clouds!\nWe have addressed a representation dated 11th June 2021 to MEITY, CERT-IN and Air India Limited. The representation details - a) the laws data fiduciaries such as MobiKwik may have violated when data of their Indian users were breached; b) the limitations prevalent in the existing legal framework; and c) a list of recommendations to ensure that responses to data breaches are more robust.\nAlong with the representation, we have also affixed a set of concrete recommendations by Mr Suman Kar. These recommendations are in reference to the breach reported by Air India Limited. Mr Kar is the founder of Banbreach and has expertise in cybersecurity consulting, digital forensics and incident response. We are thankful to Mr Kar for advising us on the representation and for providing his recommendations.\nCertain data breaches may be in violation of the law\nThe data fiduciaries who faced data breaches had a legal obligation to ensure that the personal data in their custody was safeguarded. The obligation is one of conduct and not of result - that is, a data fiduciary cannot guarantee that the data will be secure but they have to employ best practices to ensure the safety of the data. This obligation flows from the Constitution, Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act, 2000) and the common law.\n Constitution: The Hon’ble Supreme Court has recognised that informational self-determination is an aspect of the right to privacy in Justice K.S Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1. Chandrachud J in his judgement in Justice K.S Puttaswamy (II) vs Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1 has noted that - “974…..The right to informational privacy is not only vertical (asserted and protected against state actors) but horizontal as well. Informational privacy requires legal protection because the individual cannot be left to an unregulated market place.” Thus, data fiduciaries have a constitutional obligation to prevent infringement of the right to privacy. IT Act, 2000: Section 43A of the IT Act, 2000 makes ‘body corporates’ liable for losses arising from their negligent handling of sensitive personal data. Rule 8 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data Or Information) Rules, 2011 (“2011 Rules”), mandates these “body corporates” to deploy ‘reasonable security practices and procedures’ to protect sensitive data. If data processors do not employ these practices and suffer a data breach, they have a legal obligation to provide redressal to affected users. Common law: Common-law courts have recognised the right to claim damages for privacy violations. For instance, in ABC vs Commissioner of Police and Others, WP(C) No. 12370 of 2005, the Delhi High Court awarded punitive damages of Rs Six (6) Lakh to a minor girl whose details had been leaked by the Commissioner of Police to media houses.  Limitations in the existing legal framework\nWhile the law does impose certain obligations on data fiduciaries, the redressal to users in the event of a data breach is not forthcoming. We list a few reasons why this is the case:\n No obligation to notify: There is no legal obligation on data fiduciaries to notify affected users in case a breach takes place. Communicate-Comply-Investigate is a three-step process that should be complied with for mitigating the impact of breaches. This means that data fiduciaries must inform the public when a data breach occurs. While Air India Ltd did send across a notification to its customers, MobiKwik chose not to engage at all. Sensitive personal data is narrowly defined: Section 43A only provides compensation for negligent handling of sensitive data. According to Rule 3 of 2011 Rules, sensitive data is limited to information such as passwords, financial information, sexual orientation, medical records, and biometric information. The IT Act, 2000 does not provide any redressal if information such as name, email address, home address and passport details is breached. Lack of investigations: When breaches take place, proper investigations are not conducted to enable users to claim compensation under Section 43A of the IT Act, 2000. For example, CERT-IN, which is the body tasked to investigate such breaches under Section 70B of the IT Act, 2000, has only issued an advisory with respect to the Facebook breach. Till date, it is unclear if Facebook has been complying with Rule 8 of the 2011 Rules. With respect to the other breaches listed above, it is unclear if CERT-IN has taken any steps. Inadequate redressal mechanism: The redressal mechanism under Section 46 of the IT Act is inadequate. Under this provision, MEITY has appointed the Secretary of the Department of Information Technology of each state as adjudicating officers to determine if anyone has committed a violation of provisions of Chapter IX of IT Act, 2000 including Section 43A. In cases where data in the custody of the Government is breached, as is the case with the Air India breach, these adjudicating officers cannot adjudicate the dispute. This is because they are appointed by the government and thus, do not have the independence that is necessary to resolve a dispute which involves the government.  List of recommendations\nConsidering the possible violation of law by data fiduciaries in whose custody data was breached and the lacunae in the existing legal regime, we have made the following recommendations in the representation:\n Direct investigation into the conduct of data fiduciaries, including those mentioned below, that have faced data breaches in the past two years. Mandate data fiduciaries to notify users in case they experience a data breach. Ensure that the Indian Citizens who have been impacted by data breaches are provided adequate compensation. Undertake steps to make suitable changes in the Information Technology Act, 2000 so that a judicial officer is empowered to adjudicate disputes under Section 46. Hold the Government and Government-owned entities to stricter data security standards as compared to private entities. Increase the types of personally identifiable information mentioned in Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data Or Information) Rules, 2011 considering that the current set is exceptionally narrow. Mandate the need to maintain ‘accountability logs’ for security measures to ensure a dynamic compliance mechanism. Introduce a tiered system of security compliance based on the scale and sensitivity of data involved to enforce the security of Indian networks and databases.  Conclusion\nWe hope the MEITY, CERT-IN and Air India consider our recommendation. As World Economic Forum’s The Global Risks Report 2021 has stated, cybersecurity failure is one of the greatest threats facing humanity over the next decade. Thus it is imperative that we start taking steps to prevent such failures and develop mechanisms to provide redressal. We remain available to the addressees for any further assistance on these issues and encourage a wider community of security researchers to reach out to us on [policy@internetfreedom.in] and [legal@internetfreedom.in]\n    Important Documents  Representation dated 11.06.2021 along with recommendations by Mr Suman Kar (link) Actions on the data breach of Indian Facebook users (link) MobiKwik (link) and security vulnerability in CSC e-Governance Services (link) A round-up of other recent security breaches in the context of a Data Protection law (link) Need to provide legislative protection to security researchers for responsible disclosures (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/our-recommendations-to-protect-indians-against-data-breaches/","summary":"In view of the rise in data breaches, we write to MEITY with recommendations to prevent data breaches and provide redressal against them.","title":"Our recommendations to protect Indians against data breaches"},{"content":"    Tl;dr Mr. T. M. Krishna, a prominent Carnatic music vocalist, cultural critic, and writer, approached us to file a writ petition before the Madras High Court, challenging the entirety of the Intermediary Rules, 2021. The writ petition came up for hearing before the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court on June 10, 2021. At the hearing, Mr. Parthasarthy, advocate for Mr. T. M. Krishna argued that the Rules impinge the fundamental rights of the Petitioner, and are ultra vires the parent act. The Madras High Court issued notice to the Respondents, gave them time to file their counter affidavit and the matter will be heard in four weeks.\nBackground On February 25, 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting released the Intermediary Rules 2021 (2021 Rules), which seek to increase the government control and regulation over social media intermediaries and the content posted on such intermediaries. The 2021 Rules also bring OTT platforms and digital news media platforms under the purview of the IT Act, under Part III thereof. Read our deep dive analysis of the 2021 Rules here, where we explain how the Rules are unconstitutional, undemocratic, and how fundamentally they will change the internet usage experience.\nThe Intermediary Rules 2021 have been challenged before other High Courts, including a petition before the Kerala High Court, where we are representing LiveLaw Media Pvt. Ltd. The Kerala High Court restrained coercive action against LiveLaw Media under Part III of the Intermediary Rules, 2021.\n“Our Constitution contains a commitment to the liberty of imagination.” Mr. T. M. Krishna, a prominent Carnatic music vocalist, cultural critic, and writer, approached us to file a writ petition before the Madras High Court, challenging the entirety of the Intermediary Rules, 2021. In his words,\n“Without privacy it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to create and perform. And the privacy that ought to be afforded to us all is intrinsically linked with our right to freedom of expression. Our Constitution contains a commitment to the liberty of imagination. Censorship sans reason offends this commitment. It is in furtherance of my rights to freedom of expression and privacy that I am filing the present writ petition. I submit that the Impugned Rules offend my right as an artist and cultural commentator by both imposing a chilling effect on free speech, and by impinging on my right to privacy.”\nThe petition challenges the Intermediaries Rules on five major grounds:\n The 2021 Rules violate freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution; The 2021 Rules violate the freedom to practice any profession under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution**;** The 2021 Rules violate the fundamental right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution; The 2021 Rules are manifestly arbitrary and suffer from excessive delegation, thus violating Article 14 of the Constitution**;** and The 2021 Rules are ultra vires the Information Technology Act, 2000;  The Intermediary Rules 2021 are particularly harmful to musicians, artists and creators such as Mr. Krishna, since the chilling effect they create “tends to altogether quell the creative process and makes it impossible for a person to think imaginatively, beyond conventional boundaries, and create art that is politically and socially salient.” Privacy also is an essential component of an artist’s rights since, “without the protection of privacy it is impossible for an artist to perform freely. The creative process, which might involve challenging existing social norms, whether it is norms concerning political views, views about religion, caste, and social life, or existing mores governing obscenity and sexuality, requires a space that is wholly secluded and private.”\nProceedings before the High Court of Tamil Nadu at Madras The writ petition was filed before the Madras High Court on June 7, 2021 and came up for hearing before a division bench led by the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court on June 10, 2021. Mr. Krishna was represented by a team led by Advocate Suhrith Parthasarthy and consisting of Advocate Surasika Parthasarthy. The Internet Freedom Foundation provided legal assistance in the drafting and filing of the petition through Advocates Vrinda Bhandari, Abhinav Sekhri, Sanjana Srikumar, Tanmay Singh and Krishnesh Bapat.\nMr. Parthasarthy advanced oral arguments on behalf of Mr. T. M. Krishna and drew the Court’s attention to the five grounds taken in the petition, i.e. the 2021 Rules impinge upon different fundamental rights, and that the 2021 Rules are ultra vires the Information Technology Act, 2000.\nDirections issued by the Madras High Court The division bench of the Madras High Court comprising the Chief Justice of Tamil Nadu and Justice issued notice to the Respondents, which was accepted by an advocate representing the government. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting have been provided 3 weeks to file their counter affidavit, and the matter will be heard after 4 weeks.\nWe thank Mr. T. M. Krishna for giving us an opportunity to lend our expertise in this important case and are deeply grateful to all the lawyers who worked on this petition and especially Mr. Suhrith Parthasarthy who led the legal team.\nWe will update you on the next date of hearing.\nImportant Documents  Writ Petition filed on behalf of Mr. T.

Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from Government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information (RTI) Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from, the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of May, we have up till now filed 32 RTI requests and 1 First Appeal electronically with authorities at the Central level, concerning the various issues on which we engage with the Government.\nNote: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month\u0026rsquo;s report may be included in the present report.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 20 RTI requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:\n The Department of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare on the news report titled, “Modi govt now plans a touchless vaccination process, with Aadhaar-based facial recognition”, published in the Print dated April 6, 2021. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based face recognition system for attendance monitoring by the NHAI. We have also received a reply from them. NLC India Limited on the use of Face Recognition Based Attendance Monitoring System by the Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited. The National Thermal Power Corporation on the use of Face Recognition Based Attendance Monitoring System by the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited in Chhattisgarh. The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre on their use of Face Recognition Technology System. Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Limited on the procurement of Automatic Face Recognition System by the Garden Reach Shipbuilders \u0026amp; Engineers Ltd., Department Of Defence Production. RailTel Corporation of India Ltd. on the tender granted by RailTel to Vehant Technologies in April, 2021 for the purpose of installation of advanced video surveillance systems across 100 railway stations in India.  For more information on these systems, visit IFF’s Project Panoptic.\nAdditionally, we also filed requests with:\n The Ministry of Labour \u0026amp; Employment on the recently notified Section 142 of the Social Security Code. The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation \u0026amp; Farmers Welfare on the MoU signed between the Ministry of Agriculture and Microsoft Inc. for post harvest management solutions. The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology, the Department of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare, the National Informatics Centre and the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) on the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol which was released by Order No. 2(10)/2020-CLeS dated 11.05.2020 by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. We have also received a reply from the NIC. The Ministry of Home Affairs on orders or directions issued by the Competent Authority under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009. The Department of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare on the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWin) Application developed by the Union Government of India for effective management of Covid-19 vaccines distribution.

IFF/2021/012 dated March 1, 2021.  Further, on May 17, 2021, six of our second appeals before the CIC came up for hearing. The six appeals pertained to RTI requests asking for information about surveillance orders that the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued in 2018. After the CIC accepted our appeal, it observed that the MHA failed to justify reasons for denial. It also observed that our first appeal to the First Appellate Authority of the MHA was improperly rejected. It remanded the case back to them, and had directed them to re-adjudicate it by July 31, 2021. This is a positive outcome. IFF will consistently and incrementally be pushing for greater transparency and trust for interception and surveillance reforms. You can read more about the hearing and the CIC’s order here.\nNet Neutrality Through the SaveTheInternet campaign, we were able to secure a massive public victory for net neutrality in India. This resulted in legal rules which now require internet service providers and telecoms companies to treat all data equally. Protecting net neutrality in India is one of our most important campaigns. For this, we filed requests with:\n The Department of Telecommunications on our representation bearing reference no. IFF/2021/026 dated May 22, 2021.  Free Speech and Censorship Another focus of our work is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the last month, we have filed 11 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Department of Telecommunications on a news report titled, “Twitter removes over 50 posts on govt. orders, majority related to COVID-19”, published in The Hindu dated April 25, 2021. The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology, the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Home Affairs on a news report dated May 21, 2021 titled, “Centre Asks Twitter To Drop Manipulated Tag For Toolkit Tweets: Sources”, published on the NDTV website.

Hopefully it will soon lead to massive improvements including alternate modes or registration, co-win becoming more accessible, multilingual and having a privacy policy.\nBackground On 23 April, 2021, the Government of India announced the “largest vaccination drive,” in Phase III of the National Vaccination Strategy under the “Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy”. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare subsequently sent a letter to State Secretaries. These two documents lay out the conditions for Phase III of the vaccination, in which persons between the ages of 18-45 are eligible for the vaccine. We were concerned that those in the 18-45 age group can only register for the vaccine online, through the CoWIN platform, without an option to walk-in and register. Mandating online self-registration for vaccination without a walk-in facility further entrenches inequities in access to the vaccine. Only those with access to the internet and who can operate an app-based system will be able to register themselves, or will register themselves ahead of others, leaving the poor and vulnerable behind, creating an enormous divide in access to the vaccine.\nIn the wake of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a division bench of the Delhi High Court comprising Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh began hearing Manisha Chauhan v. Government of NCT of Delhi and other related matters relating to various Covid-19 relief measures, including hospital beds, oxygen supply, medicine supply, ambulance availability, and the CoWIN platform. The Court appointed Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, Sr. Advocate as its amicus curiae. An amicus curiae, or friend of the court, is not a party to the litigation, but is appointed by the Court to assist it in matters where the Court requires such assistance.\nWe drafted a note highlighting CoWIN’s issues Our legal team, led by Advocate Vrinda Bhandari and assisted by Tanmay Singh, prepared a briefing note on May 11, 2021 for Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, Sr. Advocate. The note highlighted the major issues with the CoWIN platform, in particular that only those with (a) access to a smartphone device or a laptop, (b) access to the internet, and (c) with digital literacy, i.e. with the capability of operating an app-based system or using a website will be able to register themselves, leaving the poor and vulnerable behind, creating an enormous digital divide in access to the vaccine. This is a problem, since currently, around 25% of India’s population does not have access to a smartphone. Since there is no offline option to register for the vaccine for those who are unable to secure an appointment through the CoWIN website/app, this completely excludes those who may be homeless and other vulnerable populations.\nThe CoWin website and mobile application are only available in English, and no other Indian language. This will disproportionately advantage the privileged, English-speaking urban population at the cost of the vast majority of rural India. We also pointed out that mandating that all vaccinations are routed through the government’s CoWIN platform, without clarity on how the data will be used, amounts to enforcing a “data tax” by the Government of India.\nA second note from us offered easy to implement solutions for some of the biggest problems with CoWIN\nOn May 18, 2021, we submitted a subsequent note to Mr. Rao offering suggestions for the improvement of four most pressing concerns with the CoWIN platform, but that are also the easiest to implement. Our goal was to dramatically improve the functionality of CoWIN in the easiest manner possible. We offered four suggestions to this end:\n Increase the number of people who can register from the current limit of 4 - This seriously limits the number of people that can be helped by one person with access to all of the requirements. Publish a data privacy policy - Users presently must provide personally identifiable information and personal health data to the CoWIN portal, without there being a data privacy policy in place. Publish a separate webpage containing the FAQs for CoWIN - Presently, the FAQ page on CoWIN does not open online, and requires the user to download the FAQs as a separate file on word. This reduces the accessibility. It disadvantages users who do not have access to reliable high-speed internet services, and also users who may not have achieved complete digital literacy, or those who simply may not wish to spend the additional time to download a document to read it. Alternative forms of Captcha ought to be provided using output modes for different types of sensory perception to accommodate different disabilities - CAPTCHA renders the website inaccessible to persons with visual impairment and is in contravention of the accessibility requirements of Sections 12(4) read with 42(1) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, Rule 15 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2017, Clause 6.6.3 of the Guidelines for Indian Government Websites and Apps, as well as TRAI Recommendations.  The Delhi High Court accepted all our suggestions     Mr. Rao placed both briefing notes before the Delhi High Court. On June 2, 2021 the Court passed a detailed order in respect of each of our four suggestions. With respect to the first suggestion, the Government’s counter argument made before the Court was that the number has been limited to only 4 to prevent hoarding of vaccination bookings by middlemen. This approach and reasoning did not appeal to the Court, as observed in the Order, and the Court directed the government “to keep in view the position as it exists on the ground, and there may be need for the respondents to increase the number of the registrations per mobile phone to cover large sections of the population” since “the primary object of the State should be to ensure vaccination of the maximum numbers of the population in the shortest period of time.”\nOur second suggestion relating to the privacy policy was also accepted by the Court which observed that such a policy has indeed not been placed before the Court or even disclosed on the portal. The Court ordered the central government counsel to ensure that a privacy policy is uploaded on the CoWIN portal within 4 weeks, and placed before the Court.\nThe next suggestion dealt by the Court was the concern relating to exclusions caused by the captcha. The Court held that “the endeavour of the respondents should be to make the said mobile application as user friendly as possible, so that even the not so literate people are able to use the same”, and ordered the government to examine the alternatives, such as voice enabled captchas, or the adoption of OTP Technology, and take appropriate measures within 10 days.\nThe last suggestion related to the FAQ page, which had been updated in the time between our drafting of the note, and the Court placing reliance on it. However, it was not completely updated. The Court ordered The Union of India to ensure that the FAQs on the COWIN application are updated regularly, and all relevant information is provided to the people at large who use the application.\nWe are also happy to note that changes to the COWIN platform are already underway to promote accessibility of the portal and thereby the vaccines to larger sections of the population. Recently, we observed that the COWIN platform was available in languages other than English, as suggested in our May 11, 2021 briefing note.\n  \u0026ldquo;A screenshot of the CoWIN website, accessed on a mobile phone, showing alternative langauge options.\u0026rdquo;\n  We believe that incremental change is possible through sustained advocacy and collaboration. Our goal in assisting Mr. Rao was to offer solutions that would be easiest to implement, but would simultaneously cause the biggest impact. We are grateful to Mr. Rao for placing our suggestions before the Delhi High Court. The order has reaffirmed our resolve to continue to find solutions to immediate short-term concerns, while we use strategic litigation to tackle long-term problems as well.\nImportant documents  Our note for Mr. Rajshekhar Rao offering easy-to-implement solutions to CoWIN problems (link) The Order of the Delhi High Court dated June 2, 2021 (link) Joint Statement dated May 11, 2021 ‘Ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and health care resources’ (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/delhi-high-court-issues-directions-on-suggestions-to-improve-the-cowin-platform/","summary":"Delhi High Court issued a series of directions offered by the Amicus, Senior Advocate Rajshekhar Rao on a note prepared by IFF.

As per Clause 25 of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 only the data fiduciaries can report data breaches to the Data Protection Authority, not the whistleblowers. If clause 25 in its current form becomes the law then people will be dissuaded from whistleblowing. Further, though the Bill provides protection to researchers under Clause 38, there are no clear protections provided for skilled cyber security researchers who conduct vulnerability testing. Therefore we recommend that the Bill must make amendments to provide clear provisions detailing the procedure for security researchers, vulnerability testers and whistleblowers. Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 must also be amended to prevent vexatious legal claims and proceedings against vulnerability testers and cyber security experts.\nRecap This is the last post in the #DataProtectionTop10 series. In these past 4 weeks, through 9 posts, we discussed the issues with the Personal Data protection Bill, 2019.\nHere is a quick recap: We started off the series by discussing the issues with the preamble of the Bill; namely, lack of clarity on the objectives of the Bill (part 1). Then we saw in part 2 how certain provisions in the Bill (particularly the provisions for Governmental access to non-personal data and the provision for sandboxes) are a tool for giving preference to the private sector and the fiscal interests of the State over the informational privacy of the users. Next, we looked at the consent provisions under the Bill (part 3). The provisions under the Bill that allows the processing of personal data without the consent of the users grant the State undue access to personal data and the exception given to employers has the potential to encourage workplace surveillance.\nIn part 4, we analysed the issues with the rights guaranteed to the users under the Bill and we found that though the Bill grants certain rights, the exercise of those rights have been made difficult, and hence there is a need to strengthen the rights of users. In part 5,we looked at the issue of voluntary verification of social media accounts. And saw how this ‘voluntary verification’ may lead to a mandatory verification situation as well as advanced targeting and profiling of users.\nIn part 6, we discussed the issues with the data localisation policy of India. The Bill mandates the storage and processing of ‘critical data’ only in India, without defining what ‘critical personal data’ is. The Central Government has been given the discretion to notify critical personal data. Further, this policy also disrupts the free and open nature of the internet. Then. In part 7, we looked at a very important issue of surveillance reforms. The exemptions granted to the State from the obligations under the Bill are very wide and enable the State to conduct surveillance of the people.\nIn part 8, we saw the issues with the regulatory architecture envisaged under the Bill: the Data Protection Authority. The various provisions under the Bill such as the constitution of the Selection Committee, Central Government’s power to issue orders to the DPA impedes the independence and accountability of the DPA. Lastly, this week in part 9, we discussed certain other issues with the Bill such as the lack of provisions in the Bill to facilitate transition into the new regime and the overriding effect of the Bill over the Right to Information Act, 2005.\nIn today’s post, we discuss the ramifications of not provisioning protection to whistleblowers, digital security researchers, and vulnerability testers. India has witnessed an epidemic of data breach in recent times, including the high profile cases of Mobikwik, Air India, and Dominos. The data losses in these breaches are huge, with potentially millions of users affected. The economic impact of data breaches is also tremendous. An IBM study reported that the average data breach in India cost Rs 14 crore, an increase of 9.4% from 2014. The per unit data cost increased by 10% to Rs 5,522. The report also noted that the average time to both detect and contain a breach went up from 221 days to 230 days and from 77 to 83 days respectively. This further indicates a significant amount of information and data loss for users. The need for improved security standards is clear, and this can only be achieved if security researchers and penetration testing is undertaken on an increased scale.\nIssue Clause 25 of the Bill, relating to the Data Protection Authority (DPA), states that the users should be informed about a breach of their personal data only after the DPA considers the severity of harm, and decides if the data fiduciary should inform affected users. There are two issues with this provision: firstly, as we had discussed in Part 4, the discretion to inform the affected users is left to the DPA and that the users are not informed directly, stifling the exercise of rights of users under the Bill; secondly, the Bill casts the duty of reporting a breach of data to the DPA on the data fiduciary.\nThe mandate under Clause 25, that only a data fiduciary can report the breaches to the DPA, creates problems for whistleblowers within a data fiduciary. Often, the users are unaware of the breach of data protection obligations by the data fiduciary particularly in relation to the breach of the limitation of purpose obligation, unauthorised sharing, or a non-notification of a security event. This information asymmetry prevents the users from enforcing their rights. Now, if any personnel working with the data fiduciary comes to know about the data breach or other breach of obligations under the data protection law, they cannot inform the users as it is for the data fiduciary to report such breaches and lapses to the DPA rather than whistleblowers. If clause 25 in its current form becomes the law then people will be dissuaded from whistleblowing.\nDigital security researchers and vulnerability testers are another class of people who are important players in the cybersecurity arena. With our increased dependence on technology, data breaches have become the order of the day. We often come to know about these data breaches not from the data fiduciaries but from independent researchers. For example, the Mobikwik data breach and the Facebook data breach that were reported recently were brought into light not by the companies themselves but by independent researchers. Given the key role played by digital security researchers and vulnerability testers in exposing data breaches, it is unfortunate to note that they are not protected under the Bill.\nThough the Bill provides protection to researchers under Clause 38, there are no clear protections provided for skilled cyber security researchers who conduct vulnerability testing. Even under the current laws, such persons are not protected and are often threatened with vexatious legal claims and proceedings. Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which penalises hacking does not make any difference between malicious hackers and ethical security researchers. Even when the researchers have acted in good faith, it is no defense under the section. Data fiduciaries exploit this leeway in the provision to press charges against cybersecurity researchers who expose data breaches in their companies. For instance, in one of our earlier posts, we have discussed how a security researcher called Dissent Doe who had exposed the data breach that happened at 1to1Help was sued before the High Court of Karnataka for the disclosure of this data. In light of this incident, we had also highlighted the need to change the National Cyber Security Policy and build legislative protections within the framework of the Personal Data Protection law.\nSolution It is important to provide in the Bill protections for personnel of the respective data fiduciary who disclose the breach of obligations under the data protection law by data fiduciaries. Therefore, the Bill should include a streamlined mechanism to encourage personnel of the respective data fiduciary to report such data breaches without any fear of retaliation or retribution.\nDigital security researchers, and vulnerability testers play a key role in keeping the users safe and informing them about data breaches. Informing users about breaches in their data promptly is very important to mitigate the damage caused by such data breaches and take corrective actions. In addition to the direct breach notification to users we recommended in part 4 of this series, the Bill must be revised to provide clear provisions detailing the procedure for security researchers, vulnerability testers, data breach reporting and whistleblowers. It is also important to amend S. 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 to prevent the data fiduciaries from bringing vexatious legal claims and proceedings against vulnerability testers and cyber security experts. We also recommend that the Schedule to the Bill be amended to include narrowly tailored good faith exceptions for vulnerability testers and cyber security experts.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe decision of the Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. The Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1, which declared right to privacy as a fundamental right and recognised informational privacy as a facet of the right to privacy, is certainly a win against the State and non-state actors who intrude into our privacy and exploit our data. However, in order for us to actually exert control on how our data is collected and used we need a strong data protection law: a data protection law that puts informational privacy of the individuals before any other considerations such as the growth of India’s digital economy. We would like to stress on one important point that data is not a commodity that should be harnessed through data protection legislation, rather it is what constitutes our identity.\nOur data protection law needs to be cured of the issues that we have pointed out through this series. Provisions like clause 35 severely weaken our data protection law and will not withstand the test of constitutionality. We do not want a data protection law that undermines our right to informational privacy by giving the State immense control over our data and preference to the private sector. We want a strong and user-centric data protection law that would empower the users against the exploitation of their data. A sound data protection law is the need of the hour: this is essential not only for safeguarding the informational privacy of the individuals but is also integral for other issues such as India’s trade relations with other countries.\nThrough this series, we had hoped to draw out some of the fundamental problems with the impending Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and suggest solutions to strengthen the law. We fervently hope that we will soon get a data protection law that upholds the key tenets of data protection. Thus, we urge the Central government to make the necessary amendments to the Bill, so as to provide users with a powerful tool against exploitative data fiduciaries, data processors, and state agencies in this data-driven world.\n_This is the final post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

We will also look at how FRT developed in China is being exported throughout the world, specifically India, and what this means for Indian citizens.\nExisting laws \u0026amp; regulations in China related to facial recognition The Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China, which came into force on June 1, 2017, was enacted to ensure cybersecurity and to safeguard cyberspace sovereignty \u0026amp; national security. The law states that, “Network operators carrying out business and service activities must follow laws and administrative regulations…”. These legal obligations lay down certain requirements for the collection, use and protection of personally identifiable information (PII), which includes ‘biometric data’. However, the law is focused more on cybersecurity, in the context of national security, than on protection of ‘biometric data’, which finds a mention only in the definition section (Article 76).\nArticle 76 Clause (5) of the law defines ‘personal information’(PI) as “all kinds of information, recorded electronically or through other means, that taken alone or together with other information, is sufficient to identify a natural person’s identity, including but not limited to natural persons’ full names, birth dates, national identification numbers, personal biometric information, addresses, telephone numbers, and so forth.” (emphasis added)\nThe regulation which relates more specifically to data protection is China’s Personal Information Security Specification, which came into force on October 1, 2020. As per the introduction to the specification, it aims to “targets security challenges to PI, and regulates related behaviors by PI controllers during information processing such as collection, retention, use, sharing, transfer, and public disclosure” while also “protecting individuals‘ lawful rights and interests and society’s public interests to the greatest degree” by laying down guidelines for data-handling and protection.\nUnder the specification, ‘personal information’ includes “names, dates of birth, identity card numbers, biometric information, addresses, telecommunication contact methods, communication records and contents, account passwords, property information, credit information, location data, accommodation information, health and physiological information, transaction data, etc.” However, the specification is non-binding and does not impose any penalties. China is also reportedly working on a new data privacy law with a stronger focus on biometrics, however, enforcement of these laws remains an issue.\nAdditionally, on April 23, 2021, China published a draft standard on Security Requirements of Facial Recognition Data which lays down requirements for the collection, processing, sharing and transfer of facial recognition related data and is open for public consultation. This standard, however, is also non-mandatory. The requirements laid down in the standard are that:\n use of this data should only be for identification purposes and no predictions should be made on its basis, FRT should be used only when no alternative technology is available to fulfil the purpose of security or convenience, Individuals under 14 should not be identified on the basis of FRT, FRT data should not be stored without obtaining consent and FRT data generated or collected in China should be stored locally.  Is something better than nothing?: Reality of FRT development and use in China The laws and regulations discussed above which are in force do not explicitly regulate FRT and those that do are either non-binding or in the draft stage. Thus, while China claims to regulate FRT and respect citizens’ rights, the reality of surveillance in China, especially FRT surveillance, is in stark contrast.\nAccording to a 2018 BBC news report, “(a)n estimated 170 million CCTV cameras are already in place and some 400 million new ones are expected (to) be installed in the next three years.” According to a study of 6100 Chinese citizens conducted by the Nandu Personal Information Protection Research Center in 2019, “83% of respondents indicated that they would like to have more control over their data and 75% would prefer the option to have traditional methods of identification over FRT”.\nMore troublesome are the reports which provide insight into how this technology is being developed and used in China against ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs, most of whom are Muslim. A software engineer told the BBC, “The Chinese government use(s) Uighurs as test subjects for various experiments just like rats are used in laboratories.” There are multiple reports of Chinese companies marketing or obtaining patents for FRT which specifically picks out the Uighur minority:\n Patent filed in July 2018 by Huawei and the China Academy of Sciences describes a face recognition product that is capable of identifying people on the basis of their ethnicity. Huawei and Megvii, another Chinese technology company, started collaborating in 2018 to “test an artificial-intelligence camera system that could scan faces in a crowd and estimate each person’s age, sex and ethnicity” and could set off a \u0026lsquo;Uighur alarm\u0026rsquo; to the Chinese government when the software identified someone from the persecuted minority group. Similarly, Alibaba\u0026rsquo;s FRT was also reported to specifically pick out the Uighur minority. Hikvision has also been reported to have developed and deployed FRT capable of minority analytics in China.  China has justified its surveillance actions on the basis that they have been trying to weed out extremist factions from the majorly Muslim Uighur community to protect public security. According to Alim, a Uighur man in his 20s, who was detained after a facial recognition software identified him as Uighur, “(c)ontrolling the Uighurs has also become a test case for marketing Chinese technological prowess around the world. A hundred government agencies and companies from two dozen countries, including the US, France, Israel and the Philippines, now participate in the highly influential annual China-Eurasia Security Expo in Urumqi, the capital of the Uighur region. The ethos at the expo, and in the Chinese techno-security industry as a whole, is that Muslim populations need to be managed and made productive.” A reported 5 lakh facial scans were run by the law enforcement in the central Chinese city of Sanmenxia that, over the course of a month in 2019, screened whether residents were Uighurs.\nHere, it is also important to look at the concept of ‘Potemkin AI’, coined by Jathan Sadowski, in which the author theorises that many instances of “artificial intelligence” are just artificial displays of its power and potential wherein, even though the AI purports to be powered by sophisticated software, it actually relies on humans acting as robots. According to him, “(w)hether it’s content moderation for social media or image recognition for police surveillance, claims abound about the effectiveness of AI-powered analytics, when, in reality, the cognitive labor comes from an office building full of (low-waged) workers.” “While facial recognition technology uses aspects like skin tone and face shapes to sort images in photos or videos, it must be told by humans to categorize people based on social definitions of race or ethnicity. Chinese police, with the help of the start-ups, have done that.” The point to be noted here is that “it matters less if the system actually works that way than if people believe it does and act accordingly”. Thus, FRT surveillance in China can be said to also be more about self-regulation by the Uighurs to stamp out their religious identity, than about accurately identifying any links to extremism.\nThis has also led to China’s emergence as a leader in “terror capitalism”, a fairly new term coined by Darren Byler, under which exploitation of subjugated populations is justified by defining them as potential terrorists or security threats. According to Byler, terror capitalism generates profits by the following process:\n Profitable government contracts are given to private companies in order to build and deploy policing technologies that surveil and manage target groups. Then, using the vast amounts of biometric and social media data extracted from those groups, the private companies improve their technologies and sell retail versions of them to other states and institutions, such as schools. Finally, all this turns the target groups into a ready source of cheap labor – either through direct coercion or indirectly through stigma. (Source: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/24/surveillance-tech-facial-recognition-terror-capitalism)  Note: Darren Byler is a postdoctoral researcher in the ChinaMade project at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He received his PhD from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Washington in 2018. His research focuses on Uyghur dispossession, infrastructural power and \u0026ldquo;terror capitalism\u0026rdquo; in the city of Ürümchi, the capital of Chinese Central Asia (Xinjiang).\nHow does this affect India? China is the biggest supplier of surveillance technologies worldwide, with technology linked to Chinese companies, particularly Huawei, Hikvision, Dahua, and ZTE, supplying AI surveillance technology in sixty-three countries, of which Huawei is responsible for 50 countries. According to Kai-Fu Lee, who is an investor in the chinese company Megvii and a supporter of the expansion of Chinese AI, “China has an advantage in developing A.I. because its leaders are less fussed by “legal intricacies” or “moral consensus””.\nAs stated above, these systems are developed by the Police, while working with these companies, wherein the Police supplies the database of criminals. Efforts to create such databases in India have accelerated in the past couple of years (CCTNS, NatGrid). The Delhi Government, in 2019, hired HikVision to set up 1,50,000 CCTVs in the city. Inaccurate technology systems which have been developed by and for committing violations of privacy and human rights, should not be implemented in India.\nFurther, the cost of implementing these systems is enormous. According to IFF’s Project Panoptic, almost 1,248.82 Cr INR has been spent on FRT systems in the country to date. With the country being in the throes of a once in a century pandemic, which has devastated millions, resources should not be diverted towards building a surveillance regime that will further traumatise Indians but towards improving the quality of life in the country, especially the crumbling public health infrastructure. Finally, remember that all this is being done in the absence of a data protection law in India.\nImportant documents  Facial Recognition Laws in Europe dated May 13, 2021 (link) Facial Recognition Laws in the United States dated May 3, 2021 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/facial-recognition-laws-in-china/","summary":"In the third part of our series on FRT regulation around the world, we will take a look at what are the existing laws regulating FRT in China, the reality of FRT development  \u0026amp; use by it and how it affects India.","title":"Facial Recognition Laws in China #ProjectPanoptic"},{"content":"            ‌ ‌\ntl;dr As India continues to reel under the scourge of the second wave of the fatal coronavirus outbreak, the country is confronted with yet another health hazard in the form of mucormycosis or “black fungus”. In this context, the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of NCT of Delhi (the Department) on May 27, 2021 issued a notification titled Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Mucormycosis) Regulations, 2021 which prohibited individuals or organisations from spreading “any information on mucormycosis without prior permission of the Department”. We have sent a legal notice to the Government of NCT of Delhi, seeking a revocation of the notification on grounds that such proscriptions disproportionately regulate online speech and stifle freedom of speech and expression.\nBackground Mucormycosis is a rare fungal disorder which has emerged in alarming numbers in India. While the mucor fungi have always been ubiquitous, it was not until recently that mucormycosis became a recurrent phenomenon. This disease is known to cause irreparable tissue damage to the human face, jaw, eyes and brain. While many construe it to be a collateral damage of the steroids administered to Covid-19 patients, there is evidence about independent cases of this rare fungal infections as well. Ineptitude and delay in diagnosis, sparse supply of antifungal medicines and absence of adequate medical infrastructure has rendered this disease rapidly fatal. In that milieu generating awareness about the disease with medical advisories pertaining to prevention and precautions are necessary to curb the number of fatalities. The crucial role that prompt information dissemination plays in the face of a health emergency was illustrated during the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak in India. The Supreme Court of India held that,\n “Sharing information widely is an important tool to combat Covid.”\n Between March 1, 2021 and April 21, 2021, 3,56,000 ordinary citizens had used Twitter to connect life saving resources to those requiring SOS support during the Covid crisis. Awareness and sensitisation on mucormycosis should not be perceived any differently.\nIn this context, we came across Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Mucormycosis) Regulations 2021 (Mucormycosis Regulations/ Regulations) dated May 27, 2021 issued by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of NCT of Delhi. These regulations are overbroad, detrimental to the need of the hour and are ignorant of the learnings from the second wave of COVID-19. Free speech and expression is not only a constitutional right guaranteed to the citizens of India but also has enabled mobilisation of life saving resources for those grappling with the second wave of the Coronavirus. This notification, which effectively is a gag order, has a chilling effect on free speech and prevents spread of vital information on Mucormycosis. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Regulations states:\n “5. No person/institution or organisation will spread any information or material for management of mucormycosis without prior permission from the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of NCT of Delhi.\n  6. No person/institution or organisation will use any print-electronic or any other form of media for mucormycosis without prior permission from the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of NCT of Delhi.”\n These provisions are likely to have adverse impact on the efficient management of the mucormycosis epidemic in Delhi.\n Firstly, since permission from the concerned authority is mandatory before spreading information or materials, including educational materials, about mucormycosis, health workers will not be able to provide timely guidance with its management, scientists studying the disease will not be able to publish results, and the media will not be able to report on the spread of the disease. Secondly, if any of these stakeholders speak without taking the permission of the Department, they may face prosecution under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, punishment for which extends from one month to six months of imprisonment. This is disproportionate to the cause of action and can potentially implicate providers of essential providers in the pretext of regulating misinformation.  Legality of the Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Mucormycosis) Regulations 2021 We sent a legal notice to the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of NCT of Delhi requesting them rescind the aforementioned paragraphs of the Regulations. While the underlying concerns of misinformation are relevant, imposing a blanket embargo on online speech with an overbearing threat of prosecution becomes unbecoming of a democracy and is disproportionate to any lawful regulation of misinformation. In the legal notice we have made the following points:\n Prior restraint is presumptively violative of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution: The Mucormycosis Regulations impose prior restraint; that is, they prohibit speech on mucormycosis even before it takes place unless the Department permits. In Brij Bhushan and Anr vs State of Delhi 1950 Supp SCR 245, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that prior restraint on speech is presumptively unconstitutional. Against the constitutional scheme, such forms of prior restraint give the State exclusive control over what material can be allowed to enter the marketplace of ideas. Mucormycosis Regulations are overbroad and have a chilling effect on speech: The Mucormycosis Regulations prohibit any comments on mucormycosis without the permission of the department. Indeed, ‘disinformation’ about the mucormycosis which misleads the public, can be and is prohibited (Section 505, Indian Penal Code, 1860; Section 54 Disaster Management Act, 2005). However, the breadth of the Mucormycosis Regulations prevents the publication of even bona fide comments __ otherwise permissible in law and which do not present any danger to human life, health or safety. These provisions jeopardise the act of even informing the public about the disease without prior permission of the Department. Moreover, since the Department is the arbiter of permissible speech, the Regulations also have a chilling effect on freedom of speech. Individuals will choose to stay silent than seek permission from the department for speech that may be permissible in law but which the department may not look upon favourably. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India (2015) 5 SCC 1, had struck down a provision of the Information Technology Act, 2000 because it was overbroad and had a chilling effect on freedom of speech. The Mucormycosis Regulations are contrary to the observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court on Covid-19 measures: The Hon’ble Supreme Court on April 30, 2021 in Suo Motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021 has observed that clamping down on the sharing of information about COVID-19 is against the interest of the nation and without such information, COVID-19 may turn into a tragedy worse than what it already is (Paragraph 63). These observations apply to the Mucormycosis Regulations as well. The Mucormycosis Regulations violate Article 21 of the Constitution by putting the lives of the residents of NCT in danger: As a result of the chilling effect, residents of the NCT of Delhi may entirely cease sharing materials about mucormycosis, including lawful, informative, and educational materials. Even if a resident seeks permission from the Department to lawfully post comments or remarks regarding mucormycosis, it will lead to serious delays to the dissemination of crucial life-saving information. This endangers the lives of patients and those at risk, and thus violates Article 21 of the Constitution.  To ensure that the residents of Delhi are not subjected to any unreasonable clampdowns on the freedom of speech and no lives are lost due to the unavailability of crucial information on mucormycosis resources, we urged in our legal notice that the aforementioned paragraphs be rescinded and the orders of rescission be made available to the public.\nIn May 2021, through our application under section 144(5) CrPC to the Collector of Indore, we were successful in the rescission of a similar gag order which prohibited any comments “in an unrestrained manner” on the social media regarding the transmission of the coronavirus.

Issues of surveillance, exploitation of health and other data, and the centralisation of disparate databases will be considered. Flight BAN-1984 is ready for take-off: Join the global movement to ban facial recognition surveillance** -** This session will transport participants in a virtual round-the-world tour to Europe, India, Massachusetts, New York, the West Bank and more, to explore the power of a selection of global advocacy and campaign actions against facial recognition and other forms of biometric mass surveillance. Facilitated by the European “Reclaim Your Face” campaign, speakers from the “BanWagon” coalition will showcase successes and lessons learned from their campaigns so far. Simultaneously, participants will be asked to share information about their own campaigns in the chat, with a particular focus on hearing from voices campaigning in LATAM, Africa and Asia regions. This session will be co-hosted by EDRi \u0026amp; IFF. A public health approach to the CSAM problem: Looking beyond Internet platform regulation** -** This session aims to broaden awareness of a public health approach to the prevention of child sexual abuse, to explain how this approach can be used in the fight to eliminate child sexual abuse material (CSAM) without excessive reliance upon censorship or surveillance, and to invite the establishment of new networks of human rights defenders whose advocacy is informed by this approach. The impact of strategic litigation on internet shutdowns - This strategy session will focus on how strategic litigation can be used as a tool to combat instances of internet shutdowns across the globe. Facial Recognition and the Private Sector: strategies to protect civil and consumer rights - The aim of this session is to devise principles, either legal or ethical, that must be followed by the private sector in its use of facial recognition systems (FRS), which can present challenges to civil and consumer rights, such as the rights to free consent and transparency. We also aim to strategise with consumer and civil-rights protection organisations about initiatives, legal or not, that have been taken against or in the scope of such usage. Data protection legislations for law enforcement: Multiregional perspectives for regulating data protection in criminal procedures** -** This session aims to debate the contrasting regulation approaches on data protection in criminal procedure and public security, with a primary focus on surveillance, automated decisions, and data subjects’ rights.

Masood, a resident of Hyderabad, was stopped by police officers on 19th May, 2021 who took his photographs without his consent, and even ordered him to remove his mask. Soon thereafter, he wrote to the Police Commissioner of Hyderabad reporting this incident and sought to know whether these photographs are being fed into a database and whether any privacy protections are being put in place in respect of such photographs. When he received no response, he approached us to send a legal notice to the Police Commissioner of Hyderabad on his behalf. We did so on May 31, 2021, and urged the Police Commissioner to cease such photograph collection exercises in the garb of COVID lockdown enforcement, since they achieve no objective except infringing on the fundamental rights of citizens.\n\u0026ldquo;Take off your mask\u0026rdquo; When Mr. S. Q. Masood, a social activist and consultant at various NGOs, was returning home on 19th May, 2021, after visiting his local lawyers with his father-in-law, he was stopped by approximately 8-10 police officials. They asked him to remove his mask to enable them to take his photograph on a mobile phone. This was rather shocking considering there is a pandemic ongoing, and so Masood refused to remove his mask, in view of prevailing risks. He was photographed by the police officials anyway, even though he was in compliance with all applicable lockdown measures and laws.\nHe brought the incident to the Police Commissioner’s notice on 20th May, 2021, and raised the following queries:\n What is the procedure being followed by Hyderabad City Police in collection of photos from individuals? Under what law is the Hyderabad Police collecting photos from individuals in the street? Whether these photos are being used for facial recognition by Hyderabad police? How are these photographs stored and what is the option for people to check if they are in the database and request for deletion? Who has access to the photo database? What privacy protections are available to citizens? What accountability mechanisms are in place to file complaints against officials misusing this technology to target minorities?  When he received no response to this, he approached us to draft a legal notice as a follow-up to this letter. “ The Hyderabad Police have been implementing various surveillance systems in the city without appropriate laws and rules,” he said, adding, “There is excessive use of technology in policing without safeguards for citizens and their rights. These systems can\u0026rsquo;t be without oversight.”\nSuch action is illegal and unconstitutional We drafted a legal notice to the Police Commissioner of Hyderabad on May 31, 2021 on behalf of Masood. We pointed out that as per existing law and the Constitution of India, the activities being conducted by the Hyderabad City Police are per se illegal and a clear violation of the fundamental right to privacy of persons for several reasons.\nTaking photographs of persons by police for law enforcement purposes is governed by the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920. It does not permit taking photographs of persons by police, except those who have been arrested or convicted of a crime, or sharing such photographs with any other law enforcement agency.\nAsking persons to remove face-masks to enable this illegal taking of photographs, at a time when COVID-19 is rampant, is a shocking violation of every person’s right to life as it exposes them to this deadly airborne virus.\nWe are also concerned that such photograph collection exercises carry an intention to feed the photographs into a database along with the use of facial recognition technology (FRT), since FRT uses algorithms to extract data points from your face to create a digital signature of your face. This signature is then compared with an existing database to find possible matches. However, one of the many problems with FRT is that 100% accuracy in finding matches has not been achieved and thus this technology comes with the harms of misidentification (false positive) and failure to identify (false negative). In addition to inaccuracy, this technology also poses huge threats to the fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of speech and expression. Nevertheless, use of this technology has been increasing gradually as multiple government facial recognition projects are developed and deployed across the country.\nTaking photographs of persons along with other data without any legal basis; without any measures in place for regulating their collection, storage, and use; and without any accountability mechanisms to prevent misuse, is an egregious violation of the right to privacy. The Supreme Court of India in K.S. Puttaswamy v Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 1 has held that any incursion of privacy must satisfy the tests of legality, necessity and proportionality, which were not satisfied in the present instance.\nWe urged the Commissioner to cease use of FRT under the garb of COVID-19 measures We pointed out that the activities being conducted by the Hyderabad City Police, ostensibly for purposes of enforcing lockdown related regulations, are unlawful and carry the risk of causing grave harms that are both intrinsic (through the violation of one’s privacy and the possible misuse or unauthorised sharing of such photographs) and instrumental (contracting COVID-19).\nIn light of the above concerns, we called upon the Police Commissioner of Hyderabad to immediately cease the use of any Artificial Intelligence based tools for enforcing the COVID-19 lockdown guidelines, especially facial recognition or face-matching technology. In its current form, the use of FRT is unconstitutional, devoid of any legal backing, and constitutes a disproportionate violation of privacy, and must be halted immediately. We also requested that the concerned police officials permanently delete Masood’s photographs illegally taken on May 19, 2021.\nWe will keep you updated on any developments.\nImportant Documents  Legal notice dated May 31, 2021 to the Police Commissioner of Hyderabad issued on behalf of Masood (link) Project Panoptic documenting instances of projects employing facial recognition technology in India (link) Our previous blogposts regarding the illegal and unconstitutional use of facial recognition technology (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/hyderabad-police-force-people-to-remove-their-masks-before-photographing-them-we-sent-a-legal-notice-saveourprivacy/","summary":"Hyderabad Police is forcing people to remove masks and photographing them.

Firstly, the Bill does not expressly acknowledge a natural person as the owner of their data. Secondly, the Bill does not have any provisions that give the data fiduciaries time to make a smooth transition into the new regime. Thirdly, the Bill has been given an overriding effect over other laws including the Right to Information Act, 2005. This provision may ultimately lead to undermining the RTI Act by stifling transparency. We, therefore, recommend that the Bill must acknowledge a natural person as the owner of her data, provide sound provisions for facilitating the transition to the new regime and give the RTI Act precedence over the Bill in case of inconsistency.\nBackground We are just a post away from the finale of this series. Last week we looked at two very important issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 such as the overbroad exemptions granted to the State for engaging in surveillance (Part 7) and the provisions that affect the independence and accountability of the Data Protection Authority (Part 8). In today’s post, we discuss some of the issues with the Bill that, though, are not widely discussed, have very serious implications on the effectiveness of the Bill.\nThe Bill is silent on who is the owner of the personal data. And, this can naturally lead to a doubt whether the owner of the personal data is you (from whom this data originates), or is it the data fiduciaries (who collect, store and process your personal data). This post will discuss whether the Bill clears this doubt. This post will also look into the ramifications of giving the Bill an overriding effect over other laws in force, and whether the Bill facilitates the transition into the new data protection regime.\nIssues Undoubtedly, it is the natural persons or the users to whom the data pertains who should be the owners of their data. While the Bill grants certain rights and protections to the users, it does not expressly declare that natural persons are the owners of their personal data. Some data protection laws around the world give emphasis to the right of ownership of a natural person over their personal data, one such example is the General Data Protection Law, 2018 of Brazil which states in explicit terms that \u0026ldquo;every natural person is assured ownership of her/his personal data\u0026rdquo;. The Bill has unfortunately failed to cement the foundation of our data protection law by not reiterating that natural persons are the rightful owners of their personal data.\nIt is very odd to notice that the Bill does not provide for any transition provision that would help the businesses in making a smooth transition to the new data protection regime. The Bill proposes to introduce a regime that is entirely new to the data fiduciaries and entails drastic changes to their existing data management practices. The data fiduciaries will be undergoing significant organisational changes. Even from the point of view of regulation, the State will have to augment its regulatory capacity by setting up an entirely new regulatory infrastructure for the enforcement of the Bill. This will require some time. It was for these reasons that the Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B N Sri Krishna (‘A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians’) recommended the inclusion of provisions for facilitating a seamless transition to the new data protection regime in the 2018 draft of the Bill.\nThe GDPR has been mindful of the need for facilitating such transition. GDPR came into force in the European Union (EU) after repealing its previous data protection regime: Directive 95/46/EC popularly known as the Data Protection Directive. Recital 171 of the GDPR states that ‘processing that is already underway on the date of application of the GDPR should be brought into conformity with GDPR within the period of two years after which the Regulation enters into force’. So, for a company that has been collecting and processing data as per the Data Protection Directive, a period of two years was given from the date on which the GDPR was entered into force to come in conformity with the GDPR. Furthermore, if the data was processed under the Data Protection Directive based on the consent of the users, then no further consent is required to be obtained under the GDPR if the manner in which consent was obtained under the Directive is in conformity with the consent standards under the GDPR: i.e. the consent is freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.\nAdditionally, clause 96 confers an overriding effect to the Bill. This essentially means that whenever there is a conflict between the provisions of the Bill and any other laws, the provisions of the Bill will prevail. While this is essential to give the new data protection regime supremacy over the prevailing data protection practices, such a blanket clause affects the rights of citizens under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act).\nCitizens have the right to obtain information from public authorities under Chapter II of the RTI Act. Considering the privacy implications of such disclosure of information, the RTI Act, under section 8 provides an exception to the rule of disclosure if the disclosure of the information would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the public officials. Hence, the Act provides safeguards for balancing citizen\u0026rsquo;s right to information and the right to privacy of public officials. The overriding clause under the Bill would make secrecy the rule and disclosure the exception, impeding the transparency guaranteed under the RTI Act.\nSolutions: The Bill must unequivocally acknowledge a natural person as owner of her data. A provision in this regard is necessary to entrench the control and the rights natural persons have over their personal data.\nAs stated above, a transition provision is essential for facilitating transition into the new data protection regime. The Bill should give adequate time for the data fiduciaries to make the switch to a new data protection regime. Additionally, the Bill should make it clear that the Bill applies to the data collected prior to the coming into force of the Bill, if such data is continued to be stored and processed by the data fiduciary. For example, if a website collects your data before the data protection law comes into force and continues to retain it even after the law comes into force, the website will have to comply with the new law. Similarly, if the data collected prior to this law comes into force are inconsistent with the law, they must be destroyed if consent is withdrawn. The consent taken under the old regime will have to be obtained again, if the consent obtained was not free, informed, clear, and specific.\nPrinciple 6 of the Indian Privacy Code acknowledges the importance of protecting and strengthening the right to information of individuals. The RTI Act, 2005 has been instrumental in ensuring accountability to the functioning of government and public authorities. Moreover, the RTI Act already provides adequate safeguards for the protection of privacy of the officials. The principle also addresses the need for safeguarding the independence of Information Commissioners under the RTI Act and hence states that the Information Commissioners must be exempted from interference or control by the data protection regulator.\nThe Srikrishna Committee Report observes that ‘to prevent privacy from becoming a stonewalling tactic to hinder transparency’ the data protection law should not apply to disclosure under the RTI Act. Therefore, the Bill needs to provide a carve-out for the RTI Act and specifically state that provisions of the RTI Act will have precedence over this law in case of inconsistency. This is essential for protecting the existing safeguards in place for ensuring accountability and transparency in a democratic society.\nThis is the eighth post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Read part 1 here, part 2 here, part 3 here, part 4 here, part 5 here, part 6 here, part 7 here, and part 8 here. Do join us next Tuesday (2nd June, 2021) as we analyse some other concerns with the Bill.\nImportant Documents  The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (link) The SaveOurPrivacy Campaign (link)  This post has been largely drafted by Fathima V N, who is a 2020 graduate of the National University of Advanced Legal Studies and is currently a Daksha Fellow interning at IFF with the supervision of our staff.\n      ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/dataprotectiontop10-some-holes-that-need-to-be-plugged/","summary":"In Part 9 of the #DataProtectionTop10, we analyse some miscellaneous provisions in the PDPB and recommend that the Bill acknowledge a natural person as the owner of her data, provide sound provisions for facilitating the transition to the new regime, and give the RTI Act precedence over the Bill.","title":"#DataProtectionTop10: Some holes that need to be plugged"},{"content":"            Tl;dr In Part 8 of the #DataProtectionTop10, we analyse the provisions in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 which relate to the Data Protection Authority of India (DPA). The independence of the Data Protection Authority of India is being called into question by certain provisions in the Bill such as clause 42, wherein the Selection Committee which selects the members of the DPA are all members of the executive and clause 86 which states that the DPA shall be bound by the orders of the Central Government. We recommend that the constitution of Selection Committee be made diverse and clause 86 be deleted from the Bill.\nBackground So far, we have been discussing the issues with regard to the substantive provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, such as the rights, consent, data localisation etc., and in the last post (Part 7) we discussed how the provisions in the Bill act as an enabler of surveillance by the State and the need to have a chapter on surveillance reforms in the Bill. In today’s post, we will be delving into the issues with the regulatory mechanism created under the Bill for the enforcement of these substantive provisions.\nThe Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 provides the users with certain rights and imposes certain obligations on the entities collecting and processing the data. However, a data protection regime should not end there. It should also provide for a competent enforcement mechanism to breathe life into the protections and guarantees available to the users under a data protection regime. The Bill therefore provides for the constitution of Data Protection Authorities. Having a Data Protection Authority is however not a guarantee that there would be effective enforcement of the provisions of the Bill. The strength of the regulator depends on its constitution, powers and functions. Hence, we need to examine how independent our Data Protection Authority is and what are it’s powers and functions.\nIssue: Constitution of the Selection Committee and Lack of Independence of the DPA Chapter IX contains the regulatory architecture proposed in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The regulatory body envisaged under the Bill is the Data Protection Authority of India (DPA). The DPA is entrusted with the function of monitoring and enforcement, policy framing and standard setting, research and awareness, and inquiry and grievance handling. Further, the DPA is not a sector specific regulator, every entity that handles data falls under the jurisdiction of the DPA, irrespective of the sector to which they belong.\nClause 42 deals with the constitution of the DPA. The DPA, as proposed by the Bill, shall consist of a Chairperson and not more than six whole-time Members appointed by the central government on the recommendation made by the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee in turn consists of the Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry or Department dealing with the Legal Affairs; and the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry or Department dealing with the Electronics and Information Technology. Evidently, the composition of the Selection Committee raises concerns as its members are all bureaucrats leaving the constitution of the DPA entirely to the discretion of the executive. This is a drastic shift from the structure of the Selection Committee that was proposed by the Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B N Sri Krishna (‘A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians’) and the 2018 draft of the Bill.\nThe Report as well as the 2018 draft of the Bill had prescribed a Selection Committee composed of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) or another Judge of the Supreme Court, the Cabinet Secretary and a subject-matter expert appointed by the CJI and the Cabinet Secretary. Thus, it was a mix of executive, judicial, and external expertise. This diversity is essential for ensuring the accountability of the DPA and for preventing the DPA from becoming an extended arm of the executive. It is very important that the selection of members to the DPA happen in a fair and transparent manner as the government agencies are to be regulated as data fiduciaries under the Bill - a DPA that is subordinate to the government would allow the latter to ride roughshod over privacy concerns without any measure of accountability.\nThe most egregious drawback of the PDP Bill 2019, is perhaps manifested in Clause 86, where the Central Government is empowered to issue directions to the DPA. The result being that the DPA will be tethered down by this power of the government. This will significantly encroach on the independence of the DPA to function in a capacity that ensures it is free from undue governmental interference. A blanket provision such as Clause 86, will be detrimental to achieving the goal of a truly independent data protection regulator. This is especially important given the significant exemptions provided to government agencies.\nAnother concern regarding the constitution of the DPA is the lack of decentralisation of the DPA. The data principals contemplated under the Bill cover almost everyone and hence the number of anticipated data protection grievances are also expected to be huge. This will require the constitution of DPAs at State levels. However, the Bill envisages the creation of a regulator like the RBI or SEBI which are centralised regulators. Access to enforcement mechanisms is must for the effective realisation of the rights of users under the Bill.\nThe Bill provides under Clause 62 for the appointing of Adjudication Officers for adjudging penalties and compensations under various clauses in the Bill. While this appears to be a fair provision needed for the smooth working of the data protection regime, it has been diluted by clause 62 which states that the Adjudication Officers will be appointed by the DPA. Furthermore, clause 63 provides that Adjudication Officers can adjudicate enquiries initiated only on the complaints made by the DPA. Such provisions would inevitably affect the independence of Adjudicating Officers, and so there is a need to separate the adjudication wing from the investigation wing. Since the DPA, as we have seen above, is heavily under the control of the executive, bringing another office under the DPA would essentially affect the independence and working of the data protection enforcement mechanism.\nSolution: Strong and Independent Regulatory Body An independent data protection authority is one of the core principles of data protection. In the European Union (EU),Article 52 of the GDPR contains specific provisions to ensure the independence of the members of the supervisory authorities and mandates that all DPAs in the EU act with “complete independence” when carrying out their duties. Furthermore, the European Court of Justice has also emphasised on the importance of an independent Data Protection Authority in a robust data protection framework. For instance, in European Commission v. Germany, the European Court of Justice interpreted the term ‘complete independence’ of DPAs to mean ‘a decision-making power independent of any direct or indirect external influence on the supervisory authority’.\nAs we state in the third principle of the Indian Privacy Code, a strong and independent regulator for data protection is crucial to ensure that the data protection rights are put into practice and enforced. The first and most important step towards ensuring the independence of the DPA is changing the composition of the Selection Committee. The composition of the Selection Committee must be made diverse as was proposed in the 2018 draft of the Bill. Therefore, it must comprise of a judicial authority, an executive authority and external members. To ensure transparency in the process for appointment of the DPA Chairperson and Members, the process must include an open call for applications. Further, to bring transparency to the working of the Committee, the proceedings of the Committee must be a matter of public record. The subject matter of regulation: personal data is something in which both the State and private players have vested interests. Therefore, to ensure the independence of the DPA it is essential to keep persons with vested or political interests out of the DPA. Along with ensuring independence of the DPA it is equally important to put some measures in place to make the DPA accountable to the public.\nDPA’s jurisdiction is very wide and it cuts across all the sectors. Hence, in order to make the DPA more accessible and avoid pendency, it is important that DPAs are set up at state and regional levels. Adjudicating Officers are an important constituent of the regulatory architecture under the Bill. Therefore, the Bill should provide for a transparent process for the appointment of the Adjudicating Officers. The appointment has to be done by independent bodies designed to select judicial officers. The power of the Central Government to give directions to the DPA will significantly dilute its independence. Hence, we recommend that clause 86 be deleted from the Bill. The provisions in the data protection law should be geared towards establishing the regulatory legitimacy of the DPA.\nThis is the eighth post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

Without further adieu, let’s dive into it:\nThe Big Story: Colonial Pipeline paid 75 Bitcoin or 5 Million USD in ransom to restore their services The Colonial Pipeline is a company that operates a pipeline that carries gasoline, diesel fuel, and natural gas along a 5,500 mile path from Texas to New Jersey. In early May, they released a statement confirming reports that ransomware hackers had hit its network.\nBut first, what exactly is a Ransomware attack?\nRansomware attacks typically involve the infection of computers with malicious software, often downloaded by clicking on seemingly innocuous links in emails or other website pop-ups. Users are left locked out of their systems, with the demand that a ransom be paid to restore computer functions. If you are interested in learning more about Ransomware attacks and how they work, this is a good place to start.\nThe attack on the Colonial Pipeline has been attributed by many to the DarkSide Ransomware group. They attacked the company’s business networks rather than the more sensitive operational technology that controls the pipeline. However, the company shut down their operational networks in an attempt to control the damage. This led to disruptions in the fuel supply throughout the East Coast and led to mounting pressure to restore services. Not long after, reports emerged that the company had paid $5 Million in ransom to the hackers. Once the hackers received the amount, they provided the company with a decrypting tool to restore it’s disabled computer network.\nThis is not the first time that a company’s critical infrastructure has been disrupted due to a ransomware attack. In fact, these attacks are only increasing in numbers and moreover, in the potential to cause widespread damage. The most disruptive and devastating cyberattack that the world ever witnessed actually happened way back in 2017. Below is only one example of how things turned out for one of the companies who were at the receiving end of this attack:\nHistory lesson: NotPetya\nIn June 2017, the shipping conglomerate Maersk, was hit by a ransomware attack, which later came to be known to the world as NotPetya. It is estimated that this cyberattack cost Maersk as much as $300 Million in lost revenue. With 76 ports and 800 vessels the multinational’s helplessness in the face of a total shutdown is a perfect example of the real-world disruption that cyberattacks can cause. Instantly and simultaneously, every internet-connected device of theirs was infiltrated. These included 45,000 workstations, 4,000 servers, routers, VoIP phones, physical access settings, and other infrastructure. All in all, it took 200 Maersk personnel and 400 of their Deloitte contractor counterparts 10 days, working 24/7, to rebuild the Maersk network. Months more were needed to bring about normal software functionality.\nThe NotPetya ransomware attack was so widespread and devastating that it’s been written about and covered over and over again. However, the goal of this detour into a cyberattack that happened 4 years ago is not to scare you but to bring us back to the age-old question:\nWhat can we do?\nIn the previous (and first ever) edition of Cybersec Charcha, we explored why companies must nurture a security first culture. And this is precisely why. These ransomware attacks didn’t happen out of thin air. Someone, somewhere clicked on a malicious link without cross-checking it, or they inserted a foreign USB into their devices without being sure of its contents, or maybe their devices’ softwares weren’t up-to-date and so their systems didn’t have the latest security patches that could have probably kept their devices safe. The question we should ask ourselves is, How can we avoid these instances from happening again? And the short answer is: By prioritizing digital security.\nCompanies must conduct regular digital security assessments to ensure employees are up-to-date on the latest security measures they should be aware of. Moreover, organising digital security training with a focus on enabling a behavioural shift will also go a long way in protecting critical network infrastructure that, if compromised, can cause a lot of damage.\nThe continuing saga of Breach Pe Breach…  Air India - SITA Breach: In early March, global aviation giant SITA announced that its systems had come under a cybersecurity attack. The breach had affected several airlines — American Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Finnair, Singapore Airlines, Jeju Air, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, and Lufthansa amongst others. Three months after SITA had first announced the breach, we are still learning about more victims of the attack, this time our very own struggling Indian airline, Air India. The attack compromised data of passengers who had registered with Air India over the past decade, between August 26, 2011 and February 3, 2021, Air India said in a statement. Air India is the latest Indian firm to report a data breach in the last quarter with companies like Mobikwik and BigBasket amongst others who also faced similar cybersecurity attacks exposing the personal data of millions of Indian users. You can read about the SITA Breach here and the corresponding Air India breach here. Domino’s Data Breach: More than 13 TB of data of Domino’s India users, including 10 Lakh Credit Cards were compromised. The leaked data also includes Personally Identifiable Information like phone numbers, name, email addresses and GPS location of users. The data breach was first flagged by cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia. This leaked data can potentially be used to send targeted messages to customers and spy on them. Jubilant Foodworks, Domino’s parent company, released a statement stating that no financial information was leaked in the breach and that they have taken the necessary steps to “contain the incident”. You can read more about it here. Ireland’s Health Service hit by a serious ransomware attack: Earlier in May, Ireland’s Health Service Operator shut down all their IT systems in an attempt to protect their technical infrastructure from a “very sophisticated” ransomware attack. Whereas the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program wasn’t affected, the attack did affect all other local and national health provisions. However, the Irish Health Service is not alone and this is in fact part of a deeply disturbing trend. Ransomware attacks on the healthcare sector have been skyrocketing! Here’s an important report documenting the spike in these ransomware attacks. You can read more about the Irish Health Service attack here.  So, how can we secure ourselves?\n If you find that you are one of the victims of the data breaches mentioned above, please change your passwords everywhere and enable Two-Step Verification wherever possible. Moreover, we must be careful that we don’t give away our data unintentionally. Avoid giving out your phone numbers, address and other sensitive information to places that don’t need it. Read the privacy policies of the apps you download and avoid sharing location data with third parties. Check the default settings of all your apps to understand the kind of data they have access to and limit their data storage as much as possible.

The information we sought related to the disclosure of comments on a public consultation on the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018. However, the CPIO simply cited the same exemption under S.8 of the RTI Act that she had provided before the CIC, despite clear directions from the CIC to revisit and revise.\nWe just wanted to see the comments to the PDPB consultation, but had to go all the way to the CIC for it When it comes to the Personal Data Protection Bill, the drafting, vendor selection and choices made by the \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; committee have been the subject of a long standing controversy, and civil society has criticised it for lacking diversity and expertise. One of the ways to overcome this criticism is through transparency. To further this, we filed an RTI application seeking more information not only on its working but the comments which were sent in response to a public consultation, and made the following requests:\n Kindly provide the number and a list of the names of persons who received comments and feedback. Please provide an inspection of any and all comments and feedback and records along with file notings of the feedback process of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill. Provide a copy of all comments and feedback received in electronic form on CD or by copies made available on pen drive or email.  This disclosure has strangely been resisted by MeitY, who initially denied to disclose the information without quoting any provision of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act) to justify why such denial is legal. This stance was changed before the First Appellate Authority, where the CPIO sought refuge under Section 8(1)(i) of the RTI Act, which states that cabinet papers are exempt from disclosure. We took this case to the CIC, where IFF\u0026rsquo;s Of Counsel Advocate Vrinda Bhandari was accompanied by CCG Litigation Fellow who is hosted at IFF, Krishnesh Bapat.\nBefore the CIC, the CPIO submitted her Written Submissions, where she changed her stance again, and added another ground under which to seek refuge - S. 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, which exempts from disclosure information relating to parliamentary privilege. We argued that neither S. 8(1)(i) nor 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act apply to the information we sought; that denial of access to information through any exemption under S. 8 of the RTI Act has to be justified through extensive written reasons and that the CPIO cannot simply reproduce the provision mechanically (See Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, (2020) 5 SCC 481, para 133); and that in any event, under Section 8(2) of the RTI Act a public authority may allow access to information if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests.\nThe CIC accepted our arguments, and held that the reply of the CPIO was grossly improper, and that the exemptions claimed under S. 8 of the RTI Act were not justified even though the onus to prove that a denial of a request was justified is on the CPIO. The CIC directed the CPIO to re-visit the RTI application and provide a revised reply to the appellant, and if she is not able to justify the exemption so claimed, then the desired information should be provided.\nMEITY offers the same “grossly improper” response again On 13th April, 2021, the CPIO sent their revised reply to us. Shockingly, the revised reply was substantially similar to CPIO’s written submissions before the CIC that had already been rejected by the CIC. In the table below, we have reproduced the CPIO’s revised reply and Written Submission for comparison:\nThe CPIO has simply altered the grammar in a few spots and returned the same reply to us. No justification has been provided for why S.8(1)(c) applies to the information we are seeking, beyond what has already been rejected by the CIC. Accordingly, since no justifiable exemption has been found, the CPIO ought to have disclosed the information to us. It is also not the CPIO’s case that the information is not available with the CPIO.\nOur complaint to the CIC We decided to bring this gross evasion of responsibility on part of the CPIO to the notice of the CIC, by filing a complaint under Section 18(1) of the RTI Act. In our complaint, we have set out the above factual background, including the table illustrating the shocking similarity between the CPIO’s revised reply and the written submissions.\nWe have submitted that the CPIO has malafidely denied information to and has wantonly disregarded the decision of the Hon’ble Commission dated 25th March, 2021, and have prayed for the following relief from the CIC:\n Issue appropriate orders or directions against the CPIO for acting in disregard of the directions of the Hon’ble Central Information Commission dated 25.03.2021; Issue appropriate orders or directions against the CPIO for malafidely denying information to the Complainant; and Such other reliefs as the Hon’ble Commission deems fit.  In the complaint we have submitted that the CPIO was aware that the Hon’ble Commission had dismissed the justification provided in the Written Submission and yet the CPIO chose to reproduce that justification provided in the ‘revised’ reply. This shows mala fide on part of the CPIO wherein she has deliberately refused to provide information without any reasonable cause and with a reckless intention to obstruct disclosure of information.\nWe have run from pillar to post to attain the information sought in the RTI application filed in October of 2018 and we have not yet received a proper justification why the information is being denied, let alone the information itself. However, we do not intend to let this matter go without a lawful conclusion.\nWe believe that the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) is going to be a huge step in the field of your privacy. Whether this is a step forward or a step backward can only be determined through transparency and honesty on the part of MeitY. That is why it is crucial to see the extent of public participation in the drafting of PDPB, and why the MeitY must take a much more proactive approach towards disclosure of information. We will keep you updated on the progress of our complaint.\nImportant Documents  Our complaint to the CIC against the CPIO, MeitY.

Clause 35 of the Bill gives blanket exemption to the State from the application of the Bill on the grounds of national security. This blanket exemption without any sound oversight and review mechanism raises concerns of abuse of power by the State. Hence, we recommend that a chapter on surveillance reforms be inserted in the Bill.\nBackground Last week we discussed how voluntary verification of social media accounts leads to data maximisation, and is a threat to informational privacy of users (Part 5) and how local storage of the data creates roadblocks to the free flow of data and debilitates the open nature of the internet (Part 6). In today’s post we unpack the most debated issue with the will: the exemptions granted to the State for surveillance.\nSecurity of the State and law enforcement have historically been a grey area and a stranglehold of the State, which it uses as a shield for surveilling its people. For example, India got its own monitoring program; the Central Monitoring System after the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, since a need was felt for greater coordination between law enforcement and security agencies in order to protect the security of the country. Currently, India has a host of surveillance programs, both in operation as well as in the pipeline, like the Centralised Monitoring System (CMS), The National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID), Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS), National Automated Facial Recognition System (NAFRS) etc. What is most striking is that there are no comprehensive or robust surveillance laws in the country to effectively check the working of these projects. All we have are a few provisions under the The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, and the Rules made under these statutes.\nSection 5 sub-section 2 of The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 deals with interception of communications. In times of public emergency or in the interest of public safety the government may order for the interception of communications such as your phone calls if it is satisfied that it is ‘necessary or expedient’ to do so in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State etc. A similar (probably broader) provision for interception, decryption and monitoring of our activities on the internet is contained in section 69 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. Section 69B of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, on the other hand deals with surveillance of traffic data such as the IP addresses, location, the time, date and duration of communications etc. These provisions are supplemented by the Rules: Rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007 and the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009, and Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Monitoring and Collecting Traffic Data or Information) Rules, 2009. In addition to these sections and the Rules framed thereunder, the license agreements between the Department of Telecommunications and telecom service providers require telecom service providers to assist the government in conducting surveillance.\nIssues: Overbroad exemptions and no safeguards The main issues with these provisions are that a) they do not provide for an oversight mechanism for surveillance and b) that there is no review of the order for surveillance. The orders are issued by the executive and oversight of implementation of these orders, if any, is also by the executive. The current laws on surveillance in India are fraught with several legal and procedural infirmities and pave the path to the rise of a surveillance State. It is thus imperative for us to examine whether the Personal Data Protection Bill ameliorates the concerns around the existing regime for surveillance.\nWhen the new draft of the Bill came in 2019, everyone wanted to see what the fate of the section on exemptions that granted the State significant discretionary power to exempt its agencies from any provisions of the Bill would be. It was however quite shocking to see that the Bill confers more power than ever to the State for surveillance.\nThe power of the Central Government to conduct surveillance is contained in clause 35 of the Bill. Clause 35 enables the Central Government to exempt by order any agency of the government from all or any provisions of the Bill. The order under clause 35 is passed in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, or to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence. The only safeguard given here again is that the order should be in writing and it should contain the reasons for the exemption.\nThe issues with clause 35 are very patent. The provision is very vague and broad to grant the State unfettered access to personal data without adequate safeguards. The Bill replaces the established principles of ‘necessity and proportionality’ with ‘necessity or expediency’, which allows the leeway to enact lower standards of protection. The State can exempt any of its agencies by passing an executive order and these orders are not subject to any review. Moreover, it is left to the State to prescribe the procedure, safeguards and oversight mechanism to be followed by the agency exempted from the Bill. This provision is a flagrant violation of the natural principle of justice- ‘no one shall be a judge in his own cause’.\nThe power of the State to exempt any agency of the State on very flexible grounds such as public order, or prevention of incitement to the commission of an offence by a mere executive order further increases the power of the State to surveil us. This dangerous provision can actualize our fears of the State turning into an ‘Orwellian State’. For instance, we have previously explained the possibilities of abuse of this provision in our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 on the National Population Register (NPR). NPR was originally intended as a solution to the problem of infiltration at the national borders, and therefore nothing prevents the Central Government from invoking the grounds of security of the State to exempt NPR from the provisions of the Bill.\nClause 36 is another exemption available to the State. Law enforcement agencies are exempted from the provisions of the Bill except the obligation to process the data fairly and reasonably and to maintain security safeguards in processing the data, for law enforcement purposes such as prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of any offence or any other contravention of any law. Here again, the Bill has failed to mandate that the exemption should be granted only when it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes of law enforcement.\nClause 35 vis-a-vis the Sri Krishna Committee Report Clause 35 does not incorporate the recommendations of the Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B.N. Srikrishna (‘A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians’), and is also a stark deviation from the 2018 draft of the Bill. The report warns that ‘the pillars of a data protection law should not be shaken by a vague and nebulous national security exemption’. However, it is unfortunate to note that the Bill does exactly what was feared by the Committee.\nThe report makes several incredible recommendations regarding surveillance provisions for a future data protection law:\nThe report discusses only one ground for exemptions; security of the State, as opposed to the five grounds given under clause 35. The report is emphatic that the exemptions to State should strictly adhere to the judgement of the Supreme Court of India in Justice K S Puttaswamy v. Union of India and Anr.\nAny exemption from the data protection law must be ‘necessary and proportionate’ in the interest of the security of the State and such exemption should be pursuant to a law that meets the constitutionality test. Since exemptions involve infringement of privacy of the individuals, the report mandates that the restrictions on privacy should be proportionate and narrowly tailored to the stated objectives.\nThe report does not envisage a blanket exemption to the State. The agencies of the State are not exempted from the obligation to maintain security safeguards in processing personal data.\nThe report also addresses the issue of lack of oversight of intelligence gathering and recommends that the Central Government should bring in a law to this effect. The report states that there should be ex ante access control as well as ex post accountability. Therefore, the law should provide for both parliamentary oversight as well as judicial approval of all requests for non-consensual access to personal data. Further, the surveillance laws should provide for measures to assess the extent of risks of a proposed measure to the privacy of the individual.\nSolution : a New Chapter on Surveillance Reforms As the fifth principle of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 notes a complete code on data protection comes with strong surveillance reforms. Any data protection framework has to restrict mass or dragnet surveillance as it contravenes the principles of necessity, proportionality and purpose limitation. Procedural safeguards have to be in place even for individual surveillance and interception. Interception of communications has to be through an order passed by the judiciary. The principle also states that the evidence gathered illegally must be made inadmissible as evidence in legal proceedings.\nIt is imperative that the exemptions to the State under Bill be restricted and narrowly tailored to cater to the protection of the privacy of individuals. Surveillance and interception have serious implications on the privacy of individuals, yet it is inevitable in certain circumstances. Further, the current laws do not adequately address the privacy concerns caused by surveillance and interception of communications. Therefore, the Bill should devote a separate chapter for surveillance reforms. Moreover, the agencies of the State eligible for being exempted under clause 35 must include only those agencies that are authorised by an Act of Parliament to conduct surveillance and interception. Such agencies have to be clearly identified and notified by the Central government. Further, the Bill should also provide for procedures for such agencies to seek permission from a judicial authority, preferably by special benches or tribunals consisting of retired High Court judges.\nOne of the main lacunae in the current surveillance laws is that there is no proper institutional oversight and accountability mechanism. Therefore, we recommend that an oversight and accountability structure be made part of the proposed architecture of the Data Protection Authority. An ideal way to do this would be to add within the Data Protection Authority an office for surveillance reform and oversight. For emergency surveillance and interception of communications permission may be granted through judicial orders and such orders must require the exempted agencies to follow the necessity and proportionality principles. Further, the enforcement and compliance mechanisms of such orders may be determined by the Data Protection Authority.\nMass surveillance is an egregious form of surveillance and is unsuitable in any democratic society. Therefore, there needs to be an explicit ban on mass surveillance. Clause 35 in its current form can render the rights and protections of users under the Bill redundant, and hence the Bill needs to be reviewed to make it replete with safeguards against surveillance and plug the holes in the existing laws on surveillance in the country.\nThis is the third post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

Mindful of the possible violations of the right to privacy of minors under Article 21 of the Constitution as well as the right to free and compulsory education under Article 21A and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, we wrote to the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) urging them to step in to protect child rights in Delhi.\nWhat happened? On December 17, 2020, we filed a Right to Information (RTI) request with the Education Department of the Government of NCT of Delhi. Our queries in the request related to the use of facial recognition technology in conjunction with the CCTV cameras installed by the Delhi Government in all government schools in the national capital. Our request stemmed from the Delhi Government’s decision to install CCTV cameras in more than 1,000 schools which operate under them. Worried about possible privacy violations as well as use of harmful facial recognition technology in conjunction with the CCTV cameras installed in schools, we asked the Education Department to provide us with information about:\n the total number of CCTVs installed in government schools; whether facial recognition technology is being used in conjunction with the CCTV cameras and if yes, its purpose and legality; individuals/organisations who may have access to the CCTV feeds; whether there is any Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) or regulation in place to ensure that CCTVs are not misused and that the feed is not accessed illegally; the duration for which the CCTV feed is stored or retained; and the purpose of the installation.  Over the course of the next month, we received more than 100 replies from various schools under the Delhi Government as the Education Department simply transferred our request to the schools and did not answer any of our queries themselves. Multiple schools, in their responses, confirmed our suspicion that facial recognition technology was indeed being used in conjunction with CCTV cameras in their premises. We also received many replies refusing to provide information by saying that the query relates to the Education Department, thereby indicating that facial recognition may still be in use at those schools even though they have not responded in the affirmative.\nThe decision to employ facial recognition technology in government schools, and operate such technology in respect of minors, violates their constitutional right to privacy as well as adversely impacts the right to education, and the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Similar use in the United States has been criticised by civil society organisations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and New York Civil Liberties Union (the New York affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union) which eventually led the State of New York to introduce a moratorium on the use of facial recognition in schools.\nHow does this impact children in Delhi schools? In K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1, the Supreme Court had the occasion to consider the unique nature of the right to privacy of minors. As minors lack legal capacity to give consent, violations of the right to privacy must be minimized bearing in mind the need to ensure the welfare of the child. The Court further considered the non-derogable nature of the right to education under Article 21A and the RTE Act. These factors must be taken into account in examining the legality of measures affecting the right to privacy of minor children.\nAs per the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1), any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution must conform to certain thresholds. These thresholds are:\n Legality: The intrusion must take place under a defined regime of law. There must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. In the absence of such a framework and safeguards, the first requirement for lawful restriction on the right to privacy is not met. As can be seen from the responses, there seems to be no clear Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in place for regulating how facial recognition technology is to be used by these schools. Further, the responses also fail to engage with our query relating to the legality of this use. Specific laws with regard to facial recognition do not currently exist in India. Deployment of facial recognition without adequate legal safeguards is deeply troubling. Necessity: The infringement of people’s privacy must be necessary in a democratic society to fulfill a legitimate state aim. In some of the responses above, the schools have stated that use of facial recognition technology in their premises is necessary for security and surveillance purposes. This characterisation is based on a faulty assumption that facial recognition technology is accurate and would provide speedy and correct results. However, ongoing research in the field has shown that facial recognition technology which is completely accurate has not been developed yet. Use of such inaccurate technology will thus result in misidentification. Proportionality: The Government must show among other things that the measure being undertaken has a rational nexus with the objective. Facial recognition contemplates collecting sensitive personal information, intimate information of all individuals in the absence of any reasonable suspicion. This could cast a presumption of criminality on a broad set of people. In the Supreme Court’s decision in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1 or the Aadhaar judgment , the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that, \u0026ldquo;[u]nder the garb of prevention of money laundering or black money, there cannot be such a sweeping provision which targets every resident of the country as a suspicious person.\u0026quot; While this statement was made in the context of rejecting the mandatory linkage of Aadhaar with bank accounts to counter money laundering, it clearly shows that the imposition of such a restriction in every Government school classroom, without any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the children, would constitute a disproportionate response. Similarly, collecting sensitive personal information of all children who come under the gaze of a camera enabled with facial recognition technology creates a presumption of criminality which is disproportionate to the objective it aims to achieve. Procedural safeguards: Where there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. At present, there is no independent institutional mechanism which would put in place procedural safeguards which will regulate the proposed projects. In the absence of any checks and balances, function creep becomes an immediate problem wherein the issue of facial recognition being used for functions more than its stated purpose becomes a reality. While a flawed Personal Data Protection Bill has been introduced in the Parliament, there is uncertainty about when it will be enacted and implemented and how effective it will be in protecting the personal data of individuals. Under the current version of the Bill, wide exceptions have been provided to the Government for surveillance related activities. A strong data protection legislation is needed to hold these FRT systems accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties. Here, it is also essential to recognise that the data in the present situation relates to minors, who should ideally be given a higher level of protection.  Use of invasive technologies such as facial recognition in schools on children results in disproportionate penalties being imposed on children for minor wrongdoings, thereby curtailing their spirit. Such use on children is also problematic because as they grow changes in their appearance would make this faulty technology even more inaccurate. If a student is misidentified, they could end up having a traumatic experience which would include disciplinary action, loss of class time and potentially, unnecessary interaction with the Police leading to a criminal record.\nOur recommendations Therefore, we urged the DCPCR to take appropriate steps in exercise of powers under the RTE Act as well as the Commissions of Protection of Child Rights Act to ensure safeguards against violations of child rights. In particular, we urged them to consider the need for the following steps:\n The Commission must recommend that an immediate ban should be placed on the use of facial recognition technology in schools within the territory of Delhi. A review should be conducted of existing CCTV practices in schools within the territory of Delhi, including schools controlled by the Delhi Government, examining the impact on the right to privacy as well as access to education. Based on the review, a privacy respecting SOP should be drafted and adopted by the Commission, to be followed by all schools under the Delhi Government.

But, these rules are problematic, for in many places, rather than fixing it, it actually makes it worse.\nBackground On February 25, 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) issued the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the Intermediaries Rules). We have written before about how the Intermediaries Rules are unconstitutional, undemocratic and negatively change the way we use the internet in India. As time has passed since their notification, the Intermediaries Rules have also been contentious.\nThere has been high controversy on them with at least six writ petitions (click to view our tracker) have been filed before three different High Courts of India, challenging these Rules. IFF has provided legal assistance to LiveLaw Media Private Limited in its challenge before the High Court of Kerala. This also includes arguments and reliefs from the perspective of users of social media. The Hon’ble Single Judge of the Kerala High Court was pleased to provide protection to LiveLaw Media against coercive action from MIB and MeitY in respect of the Intermediaries Rules.\nWhat happens tomorrow? Under Rule 4 of the Intermediaries Rules, significant social media intermediaries were given three months from February 25, 2021 to comply with the special provisions that apply to them. As the deadline for compliance with the Intermediaries Rules approaches, we take a look at what compliance will mean for significant social media intermediaries, and how such compliance can impact you! How it will stifle producer and user innovation and creativity in startups and platforms that may fall within the definition of significant social media intermediaries.\nThis is not only applicable to significant social media intermediaries, but also indian companies which are gaining scale in India and globally. It is necessary, then, to look at the actual provisions of the Intermediaries Rules to understand what a “significant social media intermediary” is, and what additional compliances are expected of them.\nELI5 “social media intermediary” Most of the time we (most people) spend online is on a social media platform. It provides them a place to discover interests, chat about politics and news, organise on issues and even emergency and disaster relief. As they are giving you a platform, they are not the authors and editors, they are called intermediaries. These social media companies are broadly termed as, “social media intermediaries”. Now, coming to the more technical explanation (excuse a bit of repetition, but this is important). Intermediaries which primarily or solely enable online interaction between multiple users and allow them to create and share information have been defined as ‘social media intermediaries’ under Rule 2(w) of the Intermediaries Rules.\nAmong them, the intermediaries that have more than 50 lakh (5 million) registered users have been designated as ‘significant social media intermediaries’, according to Rule 2(v) of the Intermediaries Rules and Notification S.O. 942(E) dated February 25, 2021 issued by MeitY. This sub-class, “significant social media intermediaries” come with additional compliances. But, 50 lakh is a small number when it comes to account sign-ups if a technology service is popular. Numbers add up fast! So, many platforms beyond Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and Youtube will be impacted by them.\nSo what are these compliances?     We have written about the issues with the Intermediaries Rules before: in our Deep Dive into the Rules, we summarise some of the main compliance requirements of significant social media intermediaries below.\n Reduced timelines for takedowns and assistance to government agencies. Previously, in the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 the Grievance Officer was responsible for receiving complaints from users concerning the Rules and redressing them within a month. Now, the Grievance Officer is responsible for acknowledging complaints within 24 hours and resolving them within a reduced timeline of 15 days. The Grievance Officer has also been made responsible for the receipt and acknowledgement of any order, notice or direction. Further, under the 2011 Rules, intermediaries had to “act within thirty-six hours and where applicable, work with the user or owner of such information” to take it down. Under the new Intermediaries Rules, intermediaries must complete the takedown process under Section 79(3) of the IT Act, within 36 hours. Lastly, the 2011 Rules did not specify a timeline within which intermediaries were required to provide information or assistance to law enforcement agencies. The Intermediary Rules have provided intermediaries with a 72-hour limit for providing such information or assistance. Further, the 2011 Rules did not specify any consequences upon the intermediaries for failing to comply with the provisions of the Rules; the consequence was relatively direct \u0026ndash; they lost immunity! The Intermediaries Rules, 2021 however, expressly state a loss of immunity and indicate a level of severity of consequences, including potential criminal prosecution under provisions of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code. This is a major barrier for potential entrants into the sector, who may either not have the necessary resources to acquire the necessary legal capabilities to deal with such obligations or may be scared away by the threat of criminal prosecution. It will undermine social sharing and conversation functions in any user, community centric technical environment.  Additional compliances for “significant social media intermediaries” On top of these, several additional compliances have been imposed on significant social media intermediaries under Rule 4 of the Intermediaries Rules for which the deadline is May 25. Rule 4(1) of the Intermediaries Rules states that significant social media intermediaries must publish monthly compliance reports of action taken in respect of grievances received by the grievance officer (Rule 4(1)(d)), and also appoint at least three distinct officers:\n A chief compliance officer, who will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Intermediaries Rules; A nodal contact person for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies; and A resident grievance officer, who must reside in India and receive complaints, acknowledge them within 24 hours and respond within 15 days.  All three officers appointed by the significant social media intermediaries, as above, are now legally required to reside in India. Significant social media Intermediaries are also required to have a physical contact address in India [Rule 4(5)]. Officer’s details and the physical contact address must be prominently published on its website or mobile-based Internet application. It is important to note that the Home Ministry has fortnightly meetings with all social media entities in India. This will no doubt erect a significant entry barrier to the sector, as new entrants will now have to invest a major chunk of their resources towards developing such a compliance mechanism. While behemoths like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram will easily be able to do it, smaller Indian startups will face greater financial pressure in implementation. This will also reinforce higher entry barriers when startups start to scale to the 50 lakh limit. It simply means reduced competition and hence lower levels of innovation and value for users.\nAdditionally, significant social media intermediaries must allow users to voluntarily verify their identity (Rule 4(7)). This could lead to a scenario where the voluntary becomes mandatory, as is the case with many other technologies which were introduced as “voluntary” but eventually made mandatory in an indirect manner. For instance, the Data Protection Bill also contains a similar proposal to link Government IDs with our social media accounts! Again, as Indian consumers begin to [value privacy and data security further](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/indians-care-deeply-about-privacy-of-personal-data-shows-new-study-117121500346_1.html), even if established platforms are able to navigate such obligations, new players looking to emerge in the field would be significantly hampered by such constraints.\nWhat really concerns us is your free expression and privacy! Some of the more troubling aspects of the Intermediaries Rules coming into force on May 25 are Rules 4(2) and 4(4). Under Rule 4(2), significant social media intermediaries that are primarily in the nature of messaging services must enable the traceability of the originator of messages. This is severely detrimental to the fundamental rights of speech and privacy of all citizens, since it will essentially undermine end-to-end encryption and likely cause a chilling effect on speech in private conversations.\nWhile the Intermediaries Rules clarify that in doing so, the significant social media intermediary shall not be required to disclose the contents of any electronic message, any other information related to the first originator, or any information related to its other users, the Information Technology Decryption Rules contain powers to make demands for the message content. Used together, the government will have the power to break any type of end-to-end encryption to gain knowledge of who sent what message and also get to know its contents. As we have mentioned previously, more and more Indians are valuing their privacy: 84% Indian consumers willing to pay more to do business with organisations committed to protecting data privacy. Thus, for enterprises and start-ups who have based their business on providing secure platforms for exchanging information, such an obligation would be a death blow, devaluing the enormous amounts of money, time, and research that would have gone into developing rigorous cyber-security standards.\nUnder Rule 4(4) of the Intermediaries Rules, significant social media intermediaries must enable ‘automated tools’, or basically AI technology, to identify and take down child sexual abuse material, or content depicting rape, or any information which is exactly identical in content to information that has previously been removed. This is already an example of function creep, where extreme technological measures contemplated for a limited and very serious use are slowly and imperceptibly utilized for other less serious uses, and it will lead to further function creep.\nBig tech like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Google often make terrible policies and decisions that are often harming millions of Indians. All of us at IFF, are consistently advocating with our public authorities for user rights centric regulations that help address them. It is our clear belief that the Intermediaries Rules do not fix these outstanding issues, suffer from core defects of procedural and substantive legality and end up harming your rights as well as the innovation which makes the internet so special and exciting. Today, more than ever we need to follow a path that is led by experts and the values of the Indian constitution.\nImportant Documents  Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;Deep dive: How the intermediaries rules are anti-democratic and unconstitutional.\u0026rsquo; dated 23.11.2020 (link) Previous post title ‘Coming to streaming services near you: Self-censorship!’ dated 04.03.2021 (link) Table collating all the various challenges to the Intermediaries Rules (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/pound-the-alarm-the-clock-strikes-for-social-media-tomorrow-with-the-intermediaries-rules-coming-into-effect/","summary":"Under the Intermediaries  Rules, significant social media intermediaries had a host of obligations to comply with by the deadline of 25th May, 2021.

The clock strikes for social media tomorrow with the Intermediaries Rules coming into effect."},{"content":"            Tl;dr We came across news reports of two letters issued by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (“MEITY”). The first letter is addressed to all social media platforms and seeks the removal of content related to the ‘Indian Variant’ of coronavirus. The second letter directs Twitter Inc. to remove the manipulated media tag affixed on certain tweets made by Indian political leaders. We are concerned that these letters, which have not been published by MEITY, do not have a statutory basis and curb freedom of expression over the internet. We have written to MEITY seeking withdrawal of these letters.\nBackground On 21st May 2021 we came across news reports of letters written by MEITY to social media platforms. The first letter which MEITY sent out yesterday, requests all social media platforms to remove “all the content that names, refers to, or implies ‘Indian variant’ of corona virus from your platform immediately.” The second letter (copy of the letter is not in the public domain), according to news reports, is addressed to Twitter and seeks removal of the “Manipulated Media” tag affixed by Twitter on certain tweets made by Indian political leaders.\nWe have previously discussed the impact of curbing speech during the pandemic. Such restrictions have the effect of curbing otherwise legal information which must be available to the public at large. Thus, we are concerned about the impact these two extra-legal letters may have on speech. In this post, we discuss the legality of each of these letters and the steps we have taken against them.\nCan MEITY ask social media platforms to remove all content that refers to ‘Indian Variant’ of Coronavirus? As mentioned above, through the letter dated 21.05.2021, MEITY has requested all social media platforms to remove “all the content that names, refers to, or implies ‘Indian variant’ of coronavirus from your platform immediately.” As per the letter, MEITY has made this request because a false statement is being circulated online, which implies that an ‘Indian Variant’ of the coronavirus is spreading across countries. We have three concerns with this letter:\n Lack of statutory basis: The letter does not identify a provision of law under which the request to remove content has been made. The procedure to direct intermediaries to block information is provided by Section 69-A of the Information Technology Act 2000 (IT Act, 2000) and the Information Technology (Procedure and safeguards for blocking for access of information by the public) Rules 2009 (the Blocking Rules). Both the IT Act, 2000 and the Blocking Rules permit blocking of information only after the prescribed procedure has been followed. The prescribed procedure includes giving the author of the information an opportunity of being heard under Rule 8 of the Blocking Rules. The law does not empower MEITY to write to social media platforms asking for en masse removal of content. Thus, the letter does not have any sanctity in law. Vague, overbroad and violates Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution: The letter seeks removal of ‘all the content that names, refers to or implies ‘Indian variant’ of coronavirus’. As a result of this phrasing (especially the word “implies”), social media platforms may remove myriad content which is otherwise completely permissible in law. It includes news reporting on the spread of the virus in India as well as the World Health Organisation’s press release dated 16th April 2021 which states that a “new variant was reported in India” and that “this virus variant is a variant of interest, the B1617 lineage. This was first detected and reported by India; it has two mutations: the E484Q and the L452R.” Similarly, Indian users may also be denied access to important scientific developments wherein the words ‘Indian’ and ‘Variant’ are used in the same sentence. For example, yesterday Dr Gabriel Scally, Public health physician, Visiting Professor of Public Health at the University of Bristol tweeted that “The head of BioNTec expects their Pfizer vaccine to be \u0026ldquo;up to\u0026rdquo; 75% effective against the B.1.617.2 variant (first identified in India). This compares with its 95% effectiveness against the original virus. That is a big difference.” Removal of such essential and potentially life-saving posts is likely because social media platforms employ keyword-based filtering to censor content en masse and even if the latest AI tools are deployed the removal will not account for context. Provides no legal basis to remove such content: MEITY is empowered to block information only if it is necessary to do so in the interest of sovereignty of India, defence of India, security of State, friendly relation with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence related to the above. Blocking content that refers to the ‘Indian variant’ of coronavirus is not necessary for any of these interests. Moreover, each instance of content posted online needs to be examined on its own merits, to determine whether it affects any of these interests. Asking for en masse removal prevents such an analysis and unreasonably censors speech which is protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Notably, the advisories dated 20.03.2020 and 07.05.2021 issued by the MEITY and referred to in the letter, directed social media entities to inform their users to not upload information “that may affect public order.” As opposed to those advisories, this letter seeks removal of any content that refers to ‘Indian Variant’ of coronavirus, irrespective of whether it affects public order or not.  Can MEITY ask Twitter to remove the ‘Manipulated Media’ tag? We are also concerned with another letter that MEITY has addressed to Twitter Inc.. According to media reports, through this letter MEITY has sought removal of the “Manipulated Media” tag affixed by Twitter on certain tweets made by Indian political leaders. In those tweets, the political leaders are attributing a ‘toolkit’ to a political party. The Ministry has objected to the tagging because law enforcement agencies are investigating the veracity of the ‘toolkit’.\nIn this regard, we reiterate the concern we have raised above that such letters are not anchored in any provision of law. Nothing in the IT Act, 2000 or the Rules made thereunder empowers MEITY to request Twitter to take down such tags. The law also does not prohibit twitter from affixing such tags. Moreover, the actions of Twitter aligns with Twitter’s ‘Synthetic and Manipulated Media Policy’. This policy permits Twitter to affix a tag if it finds that the content has been substantially edited or if the content is shared deceptively. The fact that a law enforcement agency is investigating the veracity of the toolkit referred to in the tweets does not prevent Twitter from tagging content on its platform. In the event that such tagging affects any ongoing investigation, it is the law enforcement agency and not the Ministry that should take steps.\nIFF’s Response To ensure that speech over social media is not unreasonably curbed, we have written to MEITY detailing our concerns. In the letter, we have urged MEITY to:\n Publish true copies of these letters on the official website of MEITY and seek legal opinion from the Ministry of Law and Justice. In the interim withdraw these letters and publish the withdrawal order on the website of the Ministry.  We are hopeful our letter is considered and we remain available to provide assistance to MEITY. We shall keep you informed on any developments on this front.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s letter dated 22.05.2021 asking MEITY to withdraw the letters (link) MEITY letter dated 21.05.2021 addressed to all social media platforms seeking removal of any content that related to ‘Indian Variant’ of coronavirus (link) IFF’s statement condemning social media censorship of posts seeking or providing COVID-19 relief April 25, 2021 (link) IFF’s video discussing the legality of orders taking down COVID-19 relief work dated April 26, 2021 (link) IFF’s video discussing the liability of WhatsApp group administrators for content posted by others dated May 5, 2021 (link) Supreme Court order in Suo Motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021 dated April 30, 2021 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/meity-asks-social-media-platforms-to-remove-content/","summary":"MEITY has written letters to social media platforms.

India’s data localisation policy confers excessive discretion to the government, and adversely affects the privacy of individuals. We recommend that the Bill explicitly define critical personal data and should not impose undue restrictions that affect the open nature of the internet.\nBackground Last time in part 5, we discussed how voluntary verification of social media accounts affects the rights to privacy of users and leads to self-censorship. In today’s post, we examine one of the most debated issues with the Bill; India’s data localisation policy.\nThe architecture of the internet is such that it is borderless. It allows the free flow of ideas across borders. In this globalised world, where trade is largely digitised, free flow of data has also become important for the free flow of services. Data localisation policies run contrary to the free and open nature of the internet as it curbs the free flow of data by requiring the storage and processing of personal data within national boundaries. It appears that the main policy considerations behind the data localisation policy are to ensure effective enforcement, prevent foreign surveillance, avoid vulnerabilities in our fibre optic cable network system, and promote growth in the Indian digital economy.\nData localisation is not an entirely new concept in India. India has implemented sectoral data localisation policies before. For example, in 2018, the RBI issued a Circular on the Storage of Payment System Data which mandates the storage of entire data related to payment systems in systems located only in India. The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 introduces a comprehensive policy for data localisation. India’s data localisation policy is mired in a host of issues and this post intends to discuss them.\nThe Issue: Lack of clarity on critical personal data The restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside India is found in Chapter VII of the Bill. The restrictions are on the transfer of two categories of personal data: the sensitive personal data and the critical personal data. Clause 33 states that sensitive personal data can be transferred outside India after obtaining the explicit consent of the data principals, but a copy of such sensitive personal data shall continue to be stored in India. This requirement is not exactly data localisation. This is mirroring of data, as processing of sensitive personal data outside India is permitted, the only restriction is that a copy of it has to be stored in India.\nOn the other hand, the Bill envisages strict data localisation for critical personal data. This means that the data classified as critical personal data can be stored and processed only in India. The transfer of critical personal data may be permitted in two situations where: the transfer is necessary for prompt actions, or the transfer, in the opinion of the Central Government, does not prejudicially affect the security and strategic interest of the State (Clause 34).\nThe issue here is that ‘critical personal data’ is not defined under the Bill, and it is the Central Government who will decide what will fall under this category. The Report of the Committee of Experts under the Chairmanship of Justice B.N. Srikrishna (‘A Free and Fair Digital Economy Protecting Privacy, Empowering Indians’) gives us some indication on what could potentially fall under the category of critical data. The report states that critical data will include all kinds of data necessary to keep the wheels of the economy and the nation-state turning. The report further states that it is a wider category and may include health, government services, infrastructure data and system control software which includes inter alia transport, waterways and all controlled and sensor mapped infrastructure. It is evident from these examples that critical personal data may even go beyond the scope of personal data. Given the ambiguity in the concept of critical personal data, leaving the Central Government with the power to determine what data will constitute critical personal data will certainly lead to abuse of power by the State through excessive and overbroad intrusions into privacy in the name of national security.\nThe Concern: Stifling innovation and threat to privacy Data localisation can stifle innovation and the free flow of data across borders. For companies from outside India, data localisation policy would mean that if they are collecting sensitive personal data of Indians, they have to have a data server located in India to store this data, or if the data they collect includes critical personal data then they will have to store and process it solely in India. Not every data fiduciary has the resources like Google and Facebook to set up servers in India. This added compliance cost would disincentivize foreign companies from bringing their services and products to India. For Indian companies, this policy would mean that their ability to avail the services of foreign cloud service providers would be restricted. Start-ups and other entities who depend on foreign cloud service providers would be required to either set up their own servers or avail the services of domestic cloud service providers. Innovation will be stifled as these businesses would be deprived of the global technological developments.\nOne of the main reasons given for data localisation is the prevention of foreign surveillance. Ironically, storing data within the State raises concerns of domestic surveillance, especially since clause 35 allows the Central government to exempt any governmental agency from the provisions of the Act. Law enforcement agencies always find it difficult to access data stored in servers that are located in other countries. With this new policy for storage of data, law enforcement agencies in the country will easily obtain greater access to data. Therefore, data localisation policy is considered very important for the effective enforcement of domestic laws. However, in the absence of strong surveillance reforms in the country, storing sensitive and critical personal data in India only raises concerns of unbridled intrusion into privacy by the State.\nFrom the perspective of data security also, data localisation is not very convincing. In fact, data localisation only creates greater risks to the security of data. Storing all critical personal data and sensitive personal data in few data centres within the country, as opposed to scattering them across the world, would only increase the risk of cyber attacks. Just like putting all our eggs in one basket!\nSolution: Define critical personal data to preserve the open nature of the internet The policy for local storage of the data under the Bill is vulnerable to abuse by the State due to the ambiguity in the concept of critical personal data and the excessive discretion given to the government in determining what constitutes critical personal data. Therefore critical personal data must be defined in the Bill itself and should not be left to be defined by the executive without any guiding principles. It is also important that data which pertains to the critical information infrastructure of the State and that does not fall under personal data be kept out of the purview of critical personal data.\nThe seventh principle of the Indian Privacy Code which is concerned with the protection of the open internet states that care and caution should be taken to preserve the global character of the open internet. Open internet is beneficial to Indians as they can access information, knowledge and services from all over the world. Hence, in a strong data protection law, rules such as blanket data localisation proposals, which would threaten and undermine the global open internet should not be included.\nTo preserve the open nature of the internet, it is imperative that the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 does not mandate the storing and processing of personal data only in India. The safety of personal data does not depend on the physical location where it is stored. The protection of personal data transferred outside the boundaries of India must be achieved through a data protection framework that provides for adequate safeguards to ensure that data protection rights apply to the data of Indians no matter where it is stored and processed. For instance, Japan amended their data protection law, The Act on the Protection of Personal Information, 2003, last year to strengthen the protection of personal data in international transfers. The Amendment will come into force in 2022 and has broadened the disclosure obligations of the data fiduciaries. It requires them to provide the users, prior to obtaining their consent, information on the data protection system of the foreign country and the actions taken by the third party for the protection of the data. The obligations of data fiduciaries have also been tightened for transfers of personal data pursuant to standard contractual clauses.\nOur data protection law should also consider incorporating such protections instead of a data localisation requirement. India should abandon the data sovereignty approach and should adopt approaches that ensure the free flow of data and protection of the rights of users.\nThis is the sixth post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Read part 1 here, part 2 here, part 3 here, part 4 here, and part 5 here. Do join us next Friday (21st May, 2021) as we analyse the provisions of the Bill related to data localisation.\nImportant Documents  The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (link) The SaveOurPrivacy Campaign (link)  This post has been largely drafted by Fathima V N, who is a 2020 graduate of the National University of Advanced Legal Studies and is currently a Daksha Fellow interning at IFF with the supervision of our staff.\n      ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/dataprotectionttop10-data-localisation-a-threat-to-free-and-open-internet/","summary":"In part 6 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we look at the restrictions imposed by the PDPB on the transfer of personal data outside India.

The MoU appears to propose that farmer’s data will be used to authenticate their identity for the receipt of entitlements under agricultural schemes. Further, the MoU speaks of a data sharing agreement, wherein the Agriculture Ministry will share farmers’ data with Microsoft. While the SOP contains guidelines for correcting gaps and errors in land records concerns on data protection, exclusion to entitlements and algorithmic governance emerge.\nBackground Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microsoft for a pilot project in 100 villages in 6 states. Under this MoU, Microsoft has been roped in to\n \u0026ldquo;to develop farmer interface for smart and well-organized agriculture, including post-harvest management and distribution\u0026rdquo;.\n The press release and subsequent media reports have indicated that a central farmer database would be prepared by linking the land records of farmers across the country that would integrate data from PM Kisan, Soil Health Cards, and the Pradhan Mantri Crop Insurance Scheme as well as other data. Geo-tagging of agricultural assets shall also take place.\nThis database will be leveraged by Microsoft and its local partner CropData to build post harvest management solutions and capture agricultural datasets such as crop yields, weather data, market demand and prices. This pilot sounds very similar to the \u0026ldquo;Agristack\u0026rdquo;, which is the collection of technologies and digital databases, proposed by the Central Government focusing on India’s farmers and the agricultural sector (for an explainer on the Agristack, please see here).\nA joint letter for transparency and consultation In response to this, on 5th May, 55 organisations (including IFF and led by various farmer groups and agricultural cooperatives) had written a joint letter to the Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. The letter highlighted a number of key concerns with the proposed project such as usurious lending practices, exploitation of farmers by procurers, reduced agency on the part of farmers, reduced transparency through algorithmic governance, and inadequate and incorrect land records. Additionally, the letter stated that:\n Extensive consultations with farmers: The Ministry should hold consultations with all stakeholders, especially farmers’ organisations, on the direction of its digital push as well as the basis of partnerships, and put out a policy document in this regard after giving due consideration to feedback from farmers and farmer organisations. As agriculture is a state subject, the central government should consult the state governments also. Need for adequate legal framework: All initiatives that the government has begun with private entities to integrate and / or share multiple databases with private/personal information about individual farmers or their farms be put on hold till (i) the policy framework mentioned in the earlier point is finalised by the ministry and (ii) a data protection law is passed by the Parliament. This agreement and any other such agreements with any IT organisations must be backed by adequate legal systems in India. Existing laws must be reviewed considering the advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data and new laws need to be enacted accordingly. Transparency and financial disclosures: The MoU signed between the Ministry of Agriculture and Microsoft India on 13th April, 2021 should be put in the public domain on the website of the ministry, apart from being put on hold as per Point 2 above. Further, any financial commitments or implications must also be put on hold and be disclosed.  Transparency is an important part of our work, and so we had taken a proactive position with respect to the third demand: on 23rd April, 2021, we filed an RTI request before the Ministry of Agriculture (Agri Ministry) and Farmers Welfare. Two days ago, on 18th May, we finally received a response to our RTI, in which the Ministry furnished us with a copy of a MoU dated April 13, 2021, between the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare at the Agri Ministry and Microsoft Corporation (India) Private Limited. We were also provided with a document titled “Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for verifying Farmer’s Database (100 Villages)”. We are thankful to the Ministry for Agriculture for providing us this information and urge them to resort for proactive disclosures on significant policy issues that help improve citizen feedback and trust in policy formation.\nBut, what is an MOU? Concerns emerge. Before we discuss the MoU, we ought to set out that a memorandum of understanding is a non-binding document, it is not enforceable in a court of law, and it ordinarily has very bare, broad and illustrative provisions. Typically an MoU is executed only to set out, in writing, what the understanding is between two parties, and to provide a roadmap for negotiations pursuant to which a binding contract is executed between those parties. However, since the MoU is a roadmap for negotiations towards a binding agreement, and also sets out the understanding between two parties, it is extremely important and helpful for us to understand some of the conversations around AgriStack and data protection.\nWe pored over the MoU and found some interesting points. Exhibit A of the MoU (page 7) has a summary of the project and bullet points on what the government will contribute and what Microsoft will contribute. Broadly, the solution proposed is that farmer’s data will be used to authenticate their identity for the receipt of entitlements under agricultural schemes.\nIt is absolutely essential here to note that under the MoU, ownership of the data, and the responsibility for its security will reside with the Ministry of Agriculture. However, the Ministry will share its datasets with Microsoft. Absolutely no clarity has been provided on how the data will be protected.\nThe MoU (on page 7) also requires the States to participate in this project to integrate the national farmer database and build a unified farmer service interface. However, the State departments have not been made parties to this MoU, even though agriculture is a state subject under the Constitution of India.\nFurther, the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) at Appendix A on page 10, appears vague on the subject of whether farmers’ data shared under the MoU is considered “confidential information”, and thus subject to protection under the NDA.\nThe SOP for verifying the farmer database As stated in the SOP, the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare intends to create a farmers database and) a framework for a digital ecosystem for Agriculture. The SOP further states that since farmer data is available under various central and state agricultural schemes, a list of farmers shall be prepared from the scheme data and compared with land records data.\nNow, it is well known that land records in India, especially records for rural areas, are riddled with errors and inconsistencies. This has been tacitly accepted by the SOP which states that even though some amount of matching was achieved, significant errors and mismatches remain. To resolve these problems, field visits to the 100 selected villages will be conducted under the Department of Agriculture. Each field team shall be provided with pre-filled excel sheets, on the basis of which they verify and correct the relevant details, including the name of the farmer, their Aadhaar number, the area of the land holding, and the schemes from which the farmer has benefitted.\nData from a 2017 PRS Legislative Research report on ‘Land Records and Titles in India’ suggests that the aforementioned issues may not have been resolved easily, as indicated by the slow progress of the Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme :\n 86% of all land records have been computerised However, only 46% of cadastral maps have been digitised Only 39% of records have had their spatial data verified Only 28% of records have been issued a digitally signed Record of Rights Only 15% of land records have real time updation of the Record of Rights and the accompanying cadastral maps Only 35% of the total area under inquiry has been surveyedOnly 9% of villages have seen survey work completed  Thus, addressing these issues will require time and patience. Most importantly, the policy design should be based on studies, feedback and consultation with farmers.\nCan databases resolve land disputes in rural india? The raison d’etre of the field visit is to identify the gaps and inconsistencies within the data and reconcile them. However, therein lies the rub: what happens in case there is disputed land? The SOP provides for handling issues related to unrecorded land, new farmers who are not present on land holding lists, and land holdings whose location has been incorrectly recorded; however, no clear process has been provided to deal with disputed land. Instead, the SOP simply states that the data collected must be “reconciled 100%”.\nResolving land disputes is a key part of cleaning up India’s land records database: a World Bank study estimated that about two-thirds of all pending cases in the country are land related disputes. Meanwhile, the NITI Aayog has estimated that “on an average it takes twenty years for a real estate or land dispute to be resolved”. Given the pervasiveness of land grabs (which have been increasing in recent years) and encroachments, such issues may not be easily resolved, and will likely require a certain amount of time to forensically analyse each case to ensure that large scale exploitation and dispossession does not take place.\nA GRAIN report titled ‘Digital fences: the financial enclosure of farmlands in South America’ has already brought to attention how digitalisation has enabled the land grabs by large scale agribusinesses in Latin America, while the requirement of digital land records for access to public schemes for agriculture has resulted in large scale exclusion. Thus, here, the Agristack may be a double-edged sword: in case such cases are rushed over and dealt with in a perfunctory manner, the resultant injustice in the form of dispossession would be locked in, whereas if land disputes are adequately addressed and resolved, India’s farmers could rest assured that their land holdings are have been digitally enshrined. Thus, there is an urgent need to address all such land disputes before creating such a database, especially since compensation-based dispute settlements have generally led to highly inadequate compensation for farmers and lengthy delays in payment.\nLastly, the project fails to mention landless or tenant farmers. Marginal farmers i.e. those with less than 1 hectare of land, constitute 68.5% of all land holdings as per the Agricultural Census of 2015-16. Meanwhile, as per the National Census 2011, 14.43 crore people are landless agricultural labourers. In terms of households, the Socio-Economic and Caste census tells us that 56.41% of rural households (10.1 crore households) do not have land.\nThese are astounding numbers, and so it is imperative that any support provided under agricultural policies address the landless. However, prima facie, the proposed database excludes landless farmers from its ambit, and so any potential benefits that are forthcoming will not be enjoyed by these households. Linking the identity of a farmer with land ownership brings other issues: for example, many estimates suggest that women constitute 60-70% of all farmers, but since they rarely own land, most schemes and technological inputs would not be made available to them. Additionally, tenant farmers and sharecroppers, who also constitute a large section of all farmers, would also not be recorded in such a database.\nWhat Next? We will continue to monitor the status of the Agristack project, trying to ensure that the government engages with farmers and listens to their needs instead of experimentation that can lead to faulty policy design and results in digital systems that result in harm. In the meantime, we are planning to hold a conference on the Agristack to bring together stakeholders from farmers groups, kisan unions, agricultural policy organisations, and civil society. Through this conference, we hope to grow public awareness about the Agristack and learn more about its potential benefits and drawbacks. We will be making a public announcement on this soon with other organisational partners to initiate greater conversation around this significant digital policy that will impact the rights of millions of India’s farmers.\nImportant Documents  Copy of the MoU dated April 13, 2021, between the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare and Microsoft Corporation (India) Private Limited (link) Copy of the document titled “Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for verifying Farmer’s Database (100 Villages)” (link) Copy of RTI response from Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare enclosing the MoU and SOP (link) Previous blogpost dated 4th December, 2020 titled “The AgriStack: A Primer #SaveOurPrivacy” (link) Previous blogpost dated 6th May, 2021 titled “#StandWithFarmers: Joint Letter by 55 Groups | Hold the Agriculture Ministry and Microsoft India Accountable” (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/revealed-ministry-of-agricultures-mou-with-microsoft-on-the-agristack-urgent-need-for-transparency-and-consultation/","summary":"In response to an RTI query by us, the Ministry of Agriculture provided us with a MoU between the Department of Agriculture and Microsoft, and a document titled “Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for verifying Farmer’s Database (100 Villages)”.","title":"Revealed: Ministry of Agriculture’s MOU with Microsoft on the Agristack. Urgent need for transparency and consultation!"},{"content":"            Tl;dr We filed 6 RTI requests to find out information in relation to the total number of electronic surveillance orders that the Ministry of Home Affairs issues. Such information does not impact national security even remotely and only safeguards the constitutional rights of every Indian. However, this was refused by the MHA leading to a second appeal before the Central Information Commission (CIC). On Monday, after CIC accepted our appeal, it observed that the MHA failed to justify reasons for denial. It also observed that our first appeal to the First Appellate Authority of the MHA was improperly rejected. It remanded the case back to them, and had directed them to re-adjudicate it by July 31, 2021. This is a positive outcome. IFF will consistently and incrementally be pushing for greater transparency and trust for interception and surveillance reforms.\nBackground On December 28, 2018, IFF filed six RTI requests seeking statistical information about electronic surveillance orders under S. 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. S. 69 is also at the heart of our writ petition demanding judicial oversight in the surveillance process. The information obtained through these RTI applications would support our litigation work, and you can read more about our PIL for surveillance reform here.\nHaving a meaningful discussion about surveillance is impossible unless there is transparency with regard to the government’s surveillance practices. So how do we fix this problem? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted \u0026ldquo;in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority\u0026rdquo;. Through these RTI requests, we hoped to fill this gap and obtain statistical data which could form the basis of inferring broad operational trends and implementing safeguards for the government’s surveillance practices. Following is an illustrative list of figures sought by us:\n  Total number of surveillance orders passed by the Competent Authority.\n  Total number of surveillance requests from law enforcement agencies rejected by the Competent Authority.\n  Total number of surveillance orders passed by the Competent Authority for prevention of any offence affecting the sovereignty or integrity, defense, or security of the State.\n  Total number of surveillance orders passed by the Competent Authority for investigation of any offence.\n  Total number of orders which authorize surveillance for more than 15 days.\n  Total number of surveillance orders which were renewed for a period exceeding 60 days.\n  The full list of the questions we asked in our RTI Applications is available here. As is clear we are asking for statistical information that in no way, shape, or form hurts national security. It on the contrary strengthens our constitutional rights by ensuring that interception is lawful, proportionate and safeguards are followed.\nSo, what happened? Even though we did not ask for details of a specific interception order or a particular individual, and despite our request being limited to anonymous and consolidated figures, the CPIO at the Ministry of Home Affairs refused to provide the information citing various exemptions under Section 8(1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act). Section 8(1) contains various provisions under which information can be denied to an applicant and contains several grounds in specific sub-sections.\nIn his response, the CPIO merely stated that disclosure of surveillance related statistics would threaten national security under Section 8(1)(a), endanger the safety of third parties under Section 8(1)(g) and interfere with ongoing investigations under Section 8(1)(h). We failed to understand why it would do either, since all we were asking for was statistical, anonymised and macro information that could better inform evidence lead policy for surveillance reforms. The First Appellate Authority also cursorily rejected our first appeal without explaining how harm would be caused by disclosure of total figures.\nNot satisfied with the responses we received from the Ministry of Home Affairs, we decided to file second appeals in these matters and approach the Central Information Commission (CIC), on 6th May, 2019. On 17th May, 2021, nearly exactly two years later, all six of our appeals finally came up for hearing.\nNational security becomes better with accountability Before the hearing, we filed additional Written Submissions in all 6 matters, since we had filed the second appeals two years ago. The updated Written Submissions gave us a chance to update the research to include latest judgments, and organise the materials before the Information Commissioner in the order that we intended to argue them.\nAt the hearing on 17th May, we were represented by Ms. Vrinda Bhandari, Advocate who was assisted by our team of lawyers, Tanmay Singh, Krishnesh Bapat, and Anushka Jain. Ms. Bhandari argued that none of the exemptions claimed by the CPIO, i.e. under Sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act were applicable, since the RTI requests were only in respect of anonymised, aggregated, statistical data, and not regarding personally identifiable data or data relating to specific orders or persons.\nWe argued that Section 8(1)(a) of the RTI Act exempts from disclosure such information which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or lead to incitement of an offence. National security is a serious issue, and we are very cognisant of the concerns surrounding undermining the security of the nation. However, seeking aggregate data of the total number of orders issued does not, and cannot, prejudicially affect any of the above competing interests. We believe that CPIOs must also be careful not to invoke a highly contentious argument of “national security” in cases where it is not relevant. Such tactics may amount to, “crying wolf” and undermine the real issues of national security. It will block honest and open discussions on evidence required for policy and legal reforms that deepen public trust in our public institutions.\nWe went on to argue that Section 8(1)(g) of the RTI Act exempts from disclosure such information which would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify the source of information or assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes. However, anonymous data which does not contain any personally identifiable information cannot endanger anyone’s life. Again, this ground just like, “national security” seemed to be completely inapplicable, and not even remotely connected to our request for information. This has also been previously held by the CIC in _Arun Kumar Prasad vs Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) [_CIC/NCCLD/A/2018/100136]. Similarly, the CIC held that Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, which exempts from disclosure information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders, is improperly relied on by the CPIO because how can disclosing the total number of investigations, possibly ‘impede the process’ of any ongoing investigations? This was also held by the Delhi High Court in BS Mathur v. Public Information Officer of the Delhi High Court [2011 125 DRJ 508 Del].\nWe also pointed out that it is well settled in CPIO, Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal [(2020) 5 SCC 481] that a CPIO cannot merely reproduce exemption sections from the RTI Act when declining to provide information pursuant to a request. They must provide extensive written reasons for why any such exemption cited is justified. The burden of proof is on the CPIO to show why requested information cannot be provided under S. 19(5) of the RTI Act. It should not be up to the applicant to show why information can be provided. It is already the applicant’s right to receive information under the RTI Act, unless an exemption under the Act justifiably applies. On the basis of these, and other, arguments, we requested the CIC to issue appropriate directions to CPIO to provide the information requested in the RTI Applications.\nCIC’s Accepts our appeal. Directs MHA to properly adjudicate our RTI. On 18.05.2021, the CIC pronounced a common final order for each of the six appeals. In its order, the CIC noted that he heard both parties at length, and found that he is not convinced with the justification provided by the Respondent for denial of information. It was held that the CPIO claimed exemptions under Section 8(1)(a), (g) and (h) of the RTI Act without establishing any connection between the exemption sections and our request for information. He went on to hold that the First Appellate Authority (FAA) has also not decided the cases at hand with due diligence and summarily disposed of the appeals, without dealing with the facts in any detail. Accordingly, the matter has been remanded to the FAA for a proper adjudication this time. The CPIO has been directed to submit a copy of the FAA’s revised order before the Commission by 31st July, 2021.\nPrivacy and transparency must be seen together In a democracy which recognises the fundamental right to privacy as held in K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India [(2017) 10 SCC 1], we must know the extent to which the State undertakes electronic surveillance activities. Privacy for citizens can only be guaranteed by guaranteeing transparency from the State. Privacy and transparency must be seen together and cannot be separated from each other.\nIn that context, this is a welcome order, because the CIC has taken cognisance of the unjustified reluctance on part of the CPIO in disclosing necessary information to us. The CIC has also set clear timelines for when the FAA must dispose of our matter before him, and sought a status report by July 31, 2021.\nWe will keep you updated on the status of this case before the FAA. We intend to pursue this information until we receive it, because it is crucial for the safety and privacy of our citizens, and it is a major step in advancing transparency on part of the state’s security agencies.\nImportant Documents  Order of the CIC dated May 17, 2021******(**link**)****** Written Submissions in one of the six appeals (our arguments and grounds in all six appeals were the same, since the denial of information by the CPIO was on exactly same grounds) (link)**** A table containing all the questions and the information we sought in the RTI Applications******(**link**)****** Previous blogpost “We won’t give up!

The classification of social media intermediaries into significant data fiduciaries is based on vague and broad grounds. Additionally, the collection of identity documents for the verification of user accounts is against the principles of data protection and violates the informational privacy of the users. Thus, we recommend that the relevant clauses be removed.\nBackground We are half-way through the series! Here is a quick recap of the series so far. In Part 1 of the series we discussed the lack of clarity on the objectives of the preamble of Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and in Part 2 we saw how this has lead to the inclusion of certain provisions in the Bill which give preference to the private sector and commercial interests of the State over the protection of personal data of the users. In Part 3 we explained how certain exceptions to consent under the Bill violate the informational privacy of individuals. In Part 4 we delved into the issues with the rights granted to the users under the Bill. In today’s post we discuss the provisions under the Bill for the regulation of social media intermediaries.\nThe Issue: Voluntary Verification of Users of Social Media Intermediaries The Bill creates a new category of data fiduciary called ‘social media intermediaries’. Clause 26 of the Bill defines a social media intermediary as an intermediary whose primary function is to enable online interaction between two or more users and allow them to create, upload, share, disseminate, modify or access information using its services. Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. fall under this category. These social media intermediaries may be further classified as significant data fiduciaries, if their user base surpasses the prescribed threshold, or their actions have, or are likely to have a significant impact on electoral democracy, security of the State, public order or the sovereignty and integrity of India. The provision further empowers the Central Government to notify these thresholds.\nThe classification of social media intermediaries into significant data fiduciaries entails increased obligations for such social media intermediaries. These obligations include conducting data impact assessments, auditing of personal data by an independent data auditor, maintenance of records, and appointing a data protection officer. While these obligations are important for the protection of personal data of the users, what is concerning is the obligation of social media intermediaries (which are notified as a significant data fiduciary) under Clause 28 that requires them to enable voluntary identification of the users. As per the provision, users who voluntarily verify their accounts have to be provided with some demonstrable and visible marks of verification.\nThe issue with these provisions is that they have little to do with a data protection regime. The classification of social media intermediaries into significant social media intermediaries is based on vague and broad factors, like significant impact on electoral democracy, security of the State, etc. These vague grounds confer ample discretion to the government for this classification. Furthermore, such classification is not on the basis of their data collection and processing practices, or the potential privacy risks that would ensue. More importantly, the collection of identity documents of users by social media companies for verification of user accounts will lead to further data collection by these companies, and it is in stark contrast to the principle of data minimisation. A provision for voluntary verification of users is not found in any other data protection laws in the world. As our identity documents are our sensitive personal data, we should prevent these social media giants from getting a hold of it.\nThe Concerns: Surveillance and Profiling of users The new category of data fiduciaries (social media intermediaries), and the provision for voluntary verification of users of social media were absent in the 2018 draft of the Bill, as well as in the report (Free and Fair Digital Economy: Protecting Privacy, Empowering India) of the Committee of Experts on a Data Protection Framework for India (Chair: Justice B. N. Srikrishna). Therefore, the objectives behind these provisions are not clear. We believe that these provisions have been included in the Bill with the aim to counter fake news and disinformation. Even if this is the intention behind the inclusion of these provisions, it is still not clear how voluntary verification of user accounts helps in curbing fake news and disinformation. For example, several sitting legislators have tweeted out scientifically inaccurate information about alternative treatments for COVID-19, in spite of the Indian Medical Association pointing out the risks associated with such treatments.\nOn the contrary, voluntary verification of user accounts can lead to profiling and targeting of users by social media intermediaries. It is no secret that social media companies thrive by capitalising on our personal data. Provisions like clause 28 enable social media companies to gain greater access to our official identifiers, which can in turn be used to engage in more advanced targeting and surveillance. The more data these companies have about us, the greater is their power over us. Giving our sensitive personal data to social media giants like Facebook comes with the risks of data breaches. We all know how frequently these social media companies face data breaches, most recent being the data breach at Facebook which exposed the personal data of over 53 crore users. Now imagine if this personal data had included our official identifiers. That would have been deeply troubling indeed!\nAgain, verification of social media accounts, means your ability to stay anonymous online is restricted. While some may argue that anonymity fuels disinformation, online abuse, etc., we cannot ignore the fact that anonymity also creates that safe space for everyone to express and share our ideas without fear. The verification of social media accounts will stoke self-censorship and will deprive whistleblowers, dissidents, victims of sexual assaults, etc, who often resort to anonymous identities on social media websites, the opportunity to share their experiences. Anonymity is a facet of the right to informational privacy. The importance of anonymity in informational privacy, particularly in this digital age, has been recognised by the Supreme Court of Canada in its landmark decision of R v. Spencer, wherein it was held that “anonymous internet activities engage a high level of informational privacy”. Therefore, any measure that impedes online anonymity will have a negative impact on the informational privacy of users.\nClause 28 of the Bill makes it easy for social media companies to demand government issued identity documents like Aadhaar which contain sensitive personal data like biometric data etc. Though the clause states that such verification process is only voluntary, due to the immense power these social media companies wield, they can restrict some of their services to the users for want of verification of their account, and this can eventually lead to the mandatory verification of accounts. This could potentially shut out thousands of users from social media platforms, depriving citizens of a key stage for expressing their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression.\nSolution - Special laws for social media intermediaries The classification of social media intermediaries into significant data fiduciaries is based on vague and broad grounds. Besides the vagueness of these grounds, they are also not connected to the objectives sought to be achieved by a data protection regime. Any measures for the regulation of social media intermediaries that are not in connection with data protection have to be through special laws for regulating the same.\nThe concerns raised by social media intermediaries other than the protection of personal data may be addressed under the realm of electoral laws, intermediary liability and competition laws. The new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 is a step in this direction. The Rules require the significant social media Intermediaries to enable their users to “voluntarily'' verify their accounts, using any appropriate mechanisms. However, these Rules are also fraught with the same issues that we have discussed above. Indeed, this has already taken place, as the Rules specify a threshold of fifty lakh (5 million) registered users for social media intermediaries to be considered and regulated as a “significant social media intermediary”. We have written vociferously against the Rules, asking for their withdrawal.\nIt is thus clear that voluntary verification of user accounts will adversely affect the informational privacy of the users, while Clause 26 is not in consonance with the objectives of a data protection regime. Hence, we recommend that these provisions be deleted from the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.\nThis is the fifth post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Read part 1 here, part 2 here, part 3 here, and part 4 here. Do join us next Friday (21st May, 2021) as we analyse the provisions of the Bill related to data localisation.\nImportant Documents  The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (link) The SaveOurPrivacy Campaign (link)  This post has been largely drafted by Fathima V N, who is a 2020 graduate of the National University of Advanced Legal Studies and is currently a Daksha Fellow interning at IFF with the supervision of our staff.\n      ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/dataprotectiontop10-voluntary-social-media-verification/","summary":"In Part 5 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we analyse the various issues with the inclusion of social media intermediaries under the  Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and the provision for voluntary verification of user accounts.

Last year, TRAI had released its final consultation paper on ‘Traffic Management Practices and Multistakeholder Body for Net Neutrality’ after extensive consultations. Those recommendations are yet to be operationalised, while ISP continue to be arbitrary in their adherence to net neutrality guidelines. In light of this, we have written to the DoT highlighting key issues that still persist. We also provided our recommendations for addressing these issues, in the hopes that they shall be considered by the Ministry while drafting the new bill.\nBackground India has experienced a significant amount of market concentration among internet service providers (ISPs). As per TRAI’s Telecom Subscription Data for January 2021, as of January 31st, 2021, 95% of the all-India market share for broadband services is captured by 3 service providers - Reliance Jio (54.51%), Bharti Airtel (24.37%), \u0026amp; Vodafone Idea (16.20%). By comparison, BSNL has only a 3.52% share in broadband services. Apart from any concerns about oligopolistic tendencies and market competition, such a situation may have a deleterious effect on the implementation of net neutrality, as those players who have captured a high share of the market may be less liable to account for such concerns.\nIn a pleasing turn of events, recent media reports have stated that the DoT (Department of Telecommunications) is planning to update the Telegraph Act, 1885, especially with regards to issues such as net neutrality. This is a good move, as it is important to update India’s regulatory framework to take into account modern considerations of internet technologies and digital infrastructure. However, India\u0026rsquo;s net neutrality regulation apparatus has seen a considerable amount of vacillation over the years, with the tensions between 1) a government trying to impose a regulatory framework, 2) an industry trying to evade responsibility and pushing for \u0026lsquo;soft touch regulation\u0026rsquo;, and 3) a civil society trying to ensure a progressive implementation of net neutrality leading to a large amount of back and forth. In between all of this, key concerns have not been addressed and errant behaviour has been allowed to become the norm. We detail some of these issues below.\nArbitrary blocking and a lack of transparency On July 31st, 2018, the DoT formalised TRAI\u0026rsquo;S recommendations on network neutrality dated 28 November, 2017. The DoT amended various telecom licenses, imposing the principle non-discriminatory treatment of internet traffic as a licensing obligation on internet providers. “Discriminatory treatment\u0026quot; has been clarified to include practices like blocking, degrading, slowing down or granting preferential speeds/treatment to any content.\nHowever, despite these clear regulatory requirements, ISPs have still continued to discriminate against certain types of internet content and block them with impunity. These instances conform with observations from a larger study published by the Centre for Internet and Society which was published on January 17, 2020. In it researchers found that the website blocklists of licensed internet service providers (ISPs) across India are widely inconsistent with one another, suggesting that a larger pattern wherein internet providers are either a) not complying with blocking orders or b) arbitrarily blocking websites without legal orders.\nIFF’s net neutrality violation tracker, which allows people to submit reports of potential net neutrality violations, has received 1,459 reports since April 2020, with 46 reports from the start of the year itself. These reports are consistent with the earlier study and indicate a wide range of websites and internet services being blocked by ISPs.\nAdditionally, TRAI’s 2017 recommendations on Net Neutrality stated that blocking requests be initiated in accordance with the law. Under section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, a Central or a State government can block access to a website on grounds such as “interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order”. Now, in its decision in Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India, dated January 10, 2020, the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court mandated (para 152(a)) that all orders which block people\u0026rsquo;s access to the internet be published for the general public. However, such orders are not easily accessible, with many orders becoming publicly available only after being released by whistleblowers. This results in a significant lack of transparency and accountability.\nThe TRAI\u0026rsquo;s recommendations On September 22nd, 2020, TRAI had released the final version of it’s consultation paper ‘Traffic Management Practices and Multistakeholder Body for Net Neutrality’. These recommendations included:\n Forming the multi-stakeholder body: The DoT must constitute the multi-stakeholder body as recommended in the consultation paper, keeping in mind concerns about industry capture highlighted above. Creation of reasonable TMP repository: Once the multi-stakeholder body has been set up, the DoT must, together with the body, create a list of suitable TMPs that meet global standards. The DoT must also help to define the narrow and specific set of conditions in which set TMPs may be deployed. Transparency and accountability with respect to deployment: The DoT, along with the multi-stakeholder body, must specify accountability and transparency measures for ISPs to adhere to when deploying TMPs. This would involve notifying users about all instances of TMP deployment in a suitable manner as described above, maintaining detailed records about each instance of deployment, and creating a forum for grievance redressal with respect to the deployment of TMPs.  The key recommendation here is the multi-stakeholder body that will ensure that ISPs will adhere to net neutrality obligations. Without an oversight body to not only frame context specific regulations but also ensure their enforcement, ISPS may continue to act in an arbitrary and discretionary manner as demonstrated above. Thus, the need of the hour is for the DoT to create and publicly disclose timelines for the implementation of the recommendations laid down by the TRAI in their consultation paper.\nOur recommendations During the consultation process last year, we provided our comments, counter-comments, and a supplementary submission on TRAI’s consultation paper ‘Traffic Management Practices and Multistakeholder Body for Net Neutrality\u0026quot; (you can read our summary of the paper here). We have also written to the DoT and TRAI asking them to protect net neutrality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our submissions largely rely on the following proposals:\n A strong and independent multistakeholder body: The multistakeholder body recommended by the TRAI must be diverse and include a proportionate number of representatives across TSPs, ISPs, small content providers, large content/application providers, civil society, think tanks, consumer advocacy groups, legal experts, free speech scholars. This shall prevent industry capture and allow for the expression of user-centric and legal perspectives. Additionally, the body must also be used as a forum to handle private complaints of net neutrality violations in a streamlined and transparent manner. Tools for monitoring and assessment: The TRAI must identify and promote global and local standards for tools to assess Traffic Management Practices (TMPs) and reduce information asymmetries. Such tools must go beyond simply measuring network speed and instead evaluate a larger set of technical characteristics. Narrow deployment of TMP exception: TMPs must only be employed in instances of congestion and threats to network integrity and security. Any reasonable deployment of TMPs must meet the following criterion: 1) must be used only in appropriate circumstances (such as congestion), 2) must be as application agnostic as possible, and 3) must only apply to rules against blocking and discrimination. Transparency and Accountability: All ISPs must disclose instances of deployment of TMPs that must be 1) comprehensive, 2) transparent, and 3) easily comprehensible. All formal complaints against ISPs must be forward to TRAI (or to an appropriate authority such as the multistakeholder body) and must be displayed in a detailed manner on a centralised database. Public campaigns to increase user awareness must be undertaken in partnership with civil society.  Additionally, there exist existing frameworks for operationalising net neutrality: the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications has released guidelines for the implementation of net neutrality frameworks as well as a reference system for users to monitor broadband connections and services and test for neutrality, performance, and quality. The guidelines provide a user-centred approach to implementing net neutrality, and lay down transparent, non-discriminatory, and proportionate rules for the same.\nJust a year after implementation, a report on the implementation of the guidelines indicated that, “there is a consistent treatment by NRAs of practices relating to the core principles of net neutrality, such as the ban on blocking of applications and discriminatory treatment of specific traffic”. Furthermore, the guidelines were found to be well suited, “to assist NRAs in performing their tasks of supervision and enforcement as set out in Article 5 of the Regulation.” Thus, we recommend that such a mode be used as a basis for implementing net neutrality enforcements mechanisms in India.\nThrough this letter, we hope to remind the ministry of the dire need to effectively address long-standing issues and implement a robust net neutrality framework. In the meantime, we we will continue to engage with the TRAI and the DoT to ensure that net neutrality is implemented and ISPs are held accountable. You can do you part and help us by reporting net neutrality violations here.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s Letter to the DoT regarding \u0026lsquo;Operationalising the TRAI’s recommendations in ‘Traffic Management Practices and Multistakeholder Body for Net Neutrality’\u0026rsquo; ([link](Operationalising the TRAI’s recommendations in ‘Traffic Management Practices and Multistakeholder Body for Net Neutrality’)) IFF’s previous work on website blocking and net neutrality (link and link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/telegraph-act-amendments-and-net-neutrality/","summary":"Recent news report have said that the Telegraph Act, 1885 will be updated to include net enutrality considerations.

Certain rights under the Bill, specifically, the right to correction and erasure and the right to data portability are not absolute and contain significant exemptions. The Bill also fails to include certain rights like the right to object to the processing of certain personal data and the right to seek exemption from automated decision making. To address these concerns, we recommend certain changes to strengthen the rights of users.\nBackground Last time around, in part 3, we looked at how the consent architecture operated under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. In this post, we will be looking at the various rights granted to users under the Bill and the issues with them.\nIn a data protection regime which claims to be rights-based, it is imperative that the users are given certain rights against the data fiduciaries. These rights are essential for the users to exercise control over their personal data. As we had noted in our explainer on the Bill, Chapter V of the Bill grants users the following rights:\n Right to confirmation and access: Users have the right to obtain their personal data as well as a summary of activities performed upon their data in a clear and concise manner. Right to correction and erasure: Users have the right to correct, complete, and update their personal data. Users also have the right to erase their personal data after it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed Right to Data Portability: Users have the right to receive and have transferred to any other fiduciary their personal data as well as any data generated during the provision of services. Right to be Forgotten: Users have the right to restrict or prevent the disclosure of their personal data if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or if they withdraw their consent.  While it is true that these rights empower the users and protect them, the Bill also creates certain impediments to the exercise of these rights. Therefore, it is important that we discuss the issues with the rights available to the users under the Bill, as well as the provisions that make the exercise of the rights cumbersome.\nThe issue: Signifcant exemptions that curtail users\u0026rsquo;s rights The right to correction, completion, updation and erasure of personal data is contained in clause 18 of the Bill. This right is important as it enables the users to ensure the accuracy of the personal data that they gave to the data fiduciaries, as well as the data that the data fiduciaries use to create profiles or arrive at certain conclusions about the users. However, this right is not absolute. Data fiduciaries can reject requests for correction, completion, updation or erasure of personal data if they disagree with such requests. Given that this right is also an integral part of the data fiduciary’s obligation to maintain the quality of data, the data fiduciaries should not be given the power to reject the requests of users unilaterally.\nClause 19 contains the right to data portability, which enables the users to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. Like the right to correction and erasure, this right is also conditional, as the data fiduciary may deny a request for data portability on the grounds of technical infeasibility or protection of a trade secret. A request cannot be denied on the ground that the compliance with the request would reveal a trade secret of the data fiduciary, as personal data is not a trade secret that belongs to any data fiduciary, rather, it belongs to the users and control over it is a fundamental right of the users. There is no option for the users to challenge the decision of the data fiduciary when the request is rejected on the ground of technical infeasibility.\nWhat rights are missing? The Bill has left out a few important rights like the right to object to processing of certain personal data and the right to seek exemption from automated decision making. The right to seek exemption from automated decision making includes the right to object to automated decision-making and to access the logic behind such decisions. The object of this right is to protect the users against the prejudice and discrimination that results from algorithmic decision-making without any human intervention. Moreover, automated decision making affects the autonomy of users negatively.\nThis is a right guaranteed under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a benchmark rights respecting data protection legislation. Article 22 of the GDPR gives the users the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects on them. We have seen in recent years how entities like Ola and Uber use algorithmic pricing and profiling to discriminate against their customers. Therefore, it is important that we have the right to seek exemption from automated decision-making and profiling in our data protection law.\nThe right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing and related profiling is another right that is present in the GDPR (Article 21) but is absent in our data protection law. The rationale behind the exclusion of such a provision from the Bill, as can be gathered from the Sri Krishna Committee report, is that direct marketing can be done only with the consent of the users. Hence, if the users do not consent to direct marketing, the data fiduciaries cannot approach the users for the same. Consent provisions are not unique to the Personal Data Protection Bill, it serves as the foundation of the GDPR as well. Yet the right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing exists only under one!\nSolution: Strengthen user rights! In order to strengthen user protection, it is also important that the users are given mandatory notice in the event of data breaches. Clause 25 provides that in case of a breach of data, the data fiduciary shall inform the Data Protection Authority, as soon as possible, where such breach is likely to cause harm to any data principal. Furthermore, the section leaves it to the determination of the Data Protection Authority, whether the users should be notified of the breach. Thus, the data fiduciaries are denied the opportunity to inform the users of breaches even if they wish to and the users are denied their right to be informed of breaches to their personal data.\nAccording to the first principle of the Indian Privacy Code, individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection. Therefore, the rights of users under the Bill have to be reviewed to ensure that the right to privacy of users gets primacy and the interests of data fiduciaries are addressed through limited exceptions. The Bill should make the disclosure of data breaches to users the rule rather than the exception. Rights such as the right to object to the processing of certain personal data and the right to seek exemption from automated decision-making have to be included in the Bill to protect the users from the challenges of emerging technologies.\nThis is the third post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Read part 1 here, part 2 here, and part 3 here. Do join us next Tuesday (18th May, 2021) as we analyse the provisions of the Bill related to social media entities.\nImportant Documents  The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (link) The SaveOurPrivacy Campaign (link)  This post has been largely drafted by Fathima V N, who is a 2020 graduate of the National University of Advanced Legal Studies and is currently a Daksha Fellow interning at IFF with the supervision of our staff.\n      ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/dataprotectiontop10-on-the-need-to-protect/","summary":"In part 4 of the #DataProtectionTop10 series, we explore the issues with the user rights under the Bill.

In our comments, we have highlighted the following concerns: firstly, that algorithmic governance must be accompanied by robust measures for accountability; secondly, that increased digitisation should be complemented with increased transparency; thirdly, the digital technology must not be deployed in a way that causes exclusion and depends the digital divide; fourthly, that technology feasibility studies and impact assessment be carried out before implementation; and lastly, that the value of judicial federalism should be promoted.\nBackground The E-Committee of the Supreme Court was established way back in 2004 and has the objective of ‘Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enablement of the Indian Judicial System’. To this end, since 2004 the E-Committee introduced Phases I and II of e-Courts Project with an overall budget of approximately 2400 crores. Phase I focused on the nuts and bolts of digitization - setting up hardware, ensuring internet connectivity, digitizing case records and operationalising the e-Courts platform. Phase II provided systems which operated independent of each other and catered to the needs of the litigant, such as National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) which permits citizens to check pendency of cases across the country, virtual courts, E-Seva Kendras and the eCourts Services App. While this process has taken years (17 years since it started), the digitisation has helped the judiciary become more efficient albeit at some cost to those on the other side of the digital divide.\nLast month, a sub-committee of the E-Committee of the Supreme Court released the Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III (the document). Once finalised by the E-Committee, this document will determine how Indian Judiciary shifts towards digitisation in the upcoming years. Last month itself we had provided an outline of the document which is available here, and we had encouraged all of you to study the document and submit your comments on ecommittee@aij.gov.in or submit them on the CIVIS platform.\nNow, after an extensive study of the draft document, discussions with stakeholders, inputs from the IFF community, and an evaluation of international best practices, we have submitted our comments to the e-Committee. Please note that our participation in this consultation process is independent of the representation we had sent to the Hon’ble Justice D.Y. Chandrachud that contained suggestions to improve the eCourts platform.\nThe Draft Vision Document The draft vision document suggests a plan of action for Phase III of the eCourt Project. As per the document, Phase III, as opposed to Phase II, seeks to adopt an ‘ecosystem’ approach where systems interact with each other. It contains several proposals that increase digitisation within the Indian judicial system:\n Installation of Relevant Hardware: To ensure that the basic hardware needed across all courts is present so as to ensure the provision of digital services. This would include installing a reliable internet network in each court, along with a steady power supply. Courts which lack other basic hardware such as computers, printers, and scanners, shall also be provided with the same. Creation of Digital Infrastructure: To build capabilities that can ensure the generation of many services. This would include a digital case registry, a freely accessible, comprehensive, and updated repository of case law, the use of intelligent scheduling algorithms, integration of Supreme Court Vidhik Anuvaad Software for translating documents, and the implementation of the Interoperable Criminal Justice System for information sharing between the police, prisons, legal aid, and the courts. Steps such as the adoption of OCR standards for documents and the use of digital signatures and blockchains for authentication will be undertaken to make documents machine readable and secure. Enabling Access to Critical Services: To simplify processes and evolve services built upon new digital infrastructure. This would include creating a Digital Case Management Mechanism, setting up more virtual courts, exploring Open Digital hearings, providing remote digital assistance for litigations with limited digital access, and the administration of legal aid by a more equitable and efficient allotment of cases. Additionally, the eFiling system will be extended, lawyers and litigants will be provided technologically enabled transcriptions of court proceedings, and systems will be built for the sending and receipt of notices through SMS and email.  The e-Committee of the Hon’ble Supreme Court has successfully led the process of digitisation of the Indian judiciary through phases I and II, and we welcome the vision laid down in the draft document for phase III. Some of the proposals in the document, such as a free repository of case law, a digital case management system, an improved E-Filing system, and mechanisms for open online hearings, are much needed and will improve a litigant’s ability to access justice.\nWhile we welcome the increased use of digital technology to address existing lacunas, we feel there is a need to ensure that such a move does not lead to over-reliance on digital technologies, which would give rise to new problems. Additionally, though these developments are welcome, they will be brought in without any independent evaluation of Phase I and II of the project and more concerningly, as of now, without data protection legislation.\nFurthermore, while India’s internet penetration is improving, evidence from government reports suggests that the country has a long way to go before attaining universal internet penetration. For example, TRAI’s ‘The Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators October – December, 2020’ report states that India has 795.18 million internet subscribers, which indicates an internet penetration rate of only 58.51%. Rural-urban disparities prevail, as indicated the rural penetration rate of 34.69%, with 308.17 million rural internet subscribers, is not even one third of the urban penetration rate of 103.98%, with 487.01 million urban internet subscribers. Additionally, 96.71% of all internet subscribers use mobile devices for accessing the internet, which may not be well suited for court proceedings. Given that around 37,439 villages in India are still not covered by telecom service providers, it is clear India’s digital infrastructure requires further expansion. Thus, the further implementation of digital technology must happen in a way that does not exacerbate the digital divide that persists throughout the country.\nOften the values of efficiency have a tendency to result in an output bias to measure outcomes on dashboards and metrics. We caution against such system design that may impair the delivery of justice and be counterively undermining the goals of the draft document. Digital technology has been a powerful tool of change in various sectors from governance to finance. India and its citizens will best benefit from such a revolutionary technology if it is implemented in a way that safeguards their fundamental rights. Thus, we have tried to provide a citizen oriented perspective in our submissions, keeping them at the center as the principal participants in any system design.\nOur Recommendations Our submissions are based on the following themes:\n Algorithmic Accountability: As India goes digital, it is only natural that the judiciary upgrades its digital infrastructure. The COVID-19 pandemic has only made this need more dire. However, given the scale at which this modernisation is projected to occur, such an endeavour must occur in a way that is transparent and promotes accountability. This would help ensure that the dispensing of justice is advanced and the judicial function is not adversely impacted by technological change. We also recommend that the relevant legislative changes are made to ensure a statutory backing for technologies. This must be buttressed with a mechanism for ‘human review’ of any algorithmic decisions, as well as a point of contact for helping to smoothen out any technology related issues during court proceedings in real time. Transparency: One of the core values of the draft vision document is ‘transparency’. In furtherance of that value, we have made three recommendations. First, we recommend that phase III of the eCourts project enables live streaming of court proceedings across the country taking lead from the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Swapnil Tripathi vs Supreme Court of India (2018) 10 SCC 639. Second, infrastructure should be established to publish pleadings filed in courts unless the parties or the court prefer otherwise or for categories of cases as per a developed docketing system (e.g. family law cases of paternity and guardianship). These steps will bolster confidence of the public in the judiciary, promote fact based verification, enable greater research into the functioning of courts and ensure justice is imparted fairly. And lastly, a right to information portal should be established which enables citizens to file RTI requests online with any court of the country. Currently, individuals have to send letters by post to public information officers which causes delay, loss of applications and has resulted in a denial of the right to know during the pandemic. Digital Inclusivity: As recognised by the draft document itself, India faces several challenges with regards to both digital infrastructure and digital literacy. This would place several constraints on the adoption of digitalised judicial services and may result in adverse consequences for digital inclusion in the context of the eCourts project. Thus, we recommend that further initiatives to increase digital literacy be undertaken before the implementation of further digitalisation. This would include training citizens in the use of digital technologies and new judicial services. Such initiatives must also be complimented by a grievance cell solely dedicated to solving technology related issues with court proceedings and judicial services. Furthermore, new technological solutions that arise from the eCourts ecosystem must be focussed towards the delivery of justice. Tech review: The draft document proposes the establishment of an entirely new digital infrastructure. Many of these proposals are innovative and have the potential to transform the judicial landscape. But before resources are invested on these proposals, we recommend that a Technical Feasibility Study - to understand the viability of these initiatives - and a Technological Impact Assessment - to understand the long term socio-economic impact of these initiatives - are conducted. These may be required at regular intervals as waves of technology adoption lead to iteration of digital systems at a rapid pace. Empower High Courts: The Constitution vests on High Courts the superintendence over district courts. The proposals in the draft document substantially impact those district courts. Thus, we seek greater detail on the role High Courts will play in the implementation of the draft document and we recommend that High Courts must be at the forefront of any efforts to digitise lower judiciary. This will also promote values of judicial federalism and ensure administrative control by respective State High Courts.  The E-Committee of the Supreme Court of India has asked for inputs from the public, which can be offered here.\nImportant Documents  The E-Committee of the Supreme Court of India’s Draft Digital Courts Vision \u0026amp; Roadmap: Phase III of the eCourts Project (link) IFF’s submissions on the Draft Vision Document (link) IFF’s comments on Niti Aayog’s draft report Designing the Future of Dispute Resolution: The ODR Policy Plan for India (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/ensuring-equity-accessibility-and-transparency-in-court-our-comments-on-the-supreme-courts-draft-vision-document/","summary":"Read our comments pursuant to the Draft Vision \u0026amp; Roadmap for Phase III of the eCourts Project released by the The eCommittee of the Supreme Court for consultation.","title":"Ensuring Equity, Accessibility and Transparency in Court: Our Comments on the Supreme Court's Draft Vision Document"},{"content":"            tl;dr In the first part of this series, we looked at how the United States has responded to the proliferation of harmful facial recognition technology (FRT) in their country. In this post, we will be looking at the diametrically different approach to FRT that has been taken in Europe. While the US is responding post-facto to the use of FRT, Europe is grappling with the conundrum of how use of FRT corresponds to its existing laws.\nFRT regulation in Europe Europe consists of around fifty countries, of which 27 countries are a part of the European Union. The table below illustrates the respective country’s stance on FRT. The stance of countries which have not been included in the table could not be verified through a valid source.\n   Country Stance on FRT     Armenia In use   Austria In use   Belarus In use   Belgium Ban   Bulgaria In use   Croatia Considering use   Cyprus In use   Czech Republic In use   Denmark In use   England In use   Estonia Approved for use (not implemented)   Finland Approved for use (not implemented)   France In use   Germany In use   Greece In use   Hungary In use   Iceland In use   Ireland In use   Italy In use   Luxembourg Ban   Malta In use   Moldova In use   Netherlands In use   Norway In use   Poland Approved for use (not implemented)   Portugal In use   Romania Approved for use (not implemented)   Russia In use   Scotland Considering use   Serbia In use   Slovakia Approved for use (not implemented)   Slovenia In use   Spain In use   Sweden Approved for use (not implemented)   Switzerland In use    Existing and proposed regulations for FRT in Europe Unlike the US and India, the member countries of the EU have a first line of defence against FRT in the form of the GDPR. The GDPR, under Art. 5, puts into place certain principles based on which personal data can be processed. These principles are ‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’, ‘purpose limitation’, ‘data minimisation’, ‘accuracy’, ‘storage limitation’, ‘integrity and confidentiality’ and ‘accountability’. Further, under Art. 9, the GDPR prohibits the processing of personal data revealing biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person.\nHowever according to Daniel Leufer, Access Now’s Europe Policy Analyst, “(t)here are quite a few exceptions to Art 9, such as (e) \u0026ldquo;processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;\u0026rdquo; and (g) \u0026ldquo;processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject\u0026rdquo;, which allow for exemptions and/or abuse.” It is probable that the use of FRT in multiple countries across Europe, as seen in the table above, is being done on the basis of these exceptions. As a result, Access Now, EDRi, and other civil society organisations across Europe have come together to launch the Reclaim Your Face campaign to stop mass surveillance through facial recognition.\nThe Law Enforcement Directive (LED) is a legislation that runs parallel to the GDPR in the EU and relates specifically to the processing of personal data by data controllers for ‘law enforcement purposes’, which falls outside of the scope of the GDPR. Art.10 of the LED states that, “Processing of special categories of personal data: Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person\u0026rsquo;s sex life or sexual orientation shall be allowed [emphasis added] only where strictly necessary, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and only:\n where authorised by Union or Member State law; to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or where such processing relates to data which are manifestly made public by the data subject.”  At present there is an active proposal on harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) in the European Commission. Under Art. 5(1)(d) of the proposal, use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is prohibited, however, the wide exemptions attached to this provision weaken it severely by acting as loopholes. The article also does not apply to other authorities or private companies and relates only to “real-time” uses thereby creating another loophole. In response to the proposal, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), EU’s privacy watchdog, stated in a press release that “ban on remote biometric identification in public space is necessary”.\nSpecific developments in the United Kingdom Since the UK has exited the EU, the GDPR and the LED are not applicable to it (after the transition period) and the new AI Act proposal will also not apply to it. However, the UK has the Data Protection Act, 2018 which regulates how personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government. The Data Protection Act, 2018 is the UK’s implementation of the GDPR and thus, in practice, applies the same principles as the GDPR with regard to processing of personal data in addition to having the similar shortcomings.\nIn addition to legislation, one of the leading legal precedent in this area is the case of Ed Bridges v. South Wales Police: Landmark case on FRT decided by the Court Of Appeal (Civil Division). After the London High Court, in September, 2019 ruled that use of FRT on Ed Bridges was not unlawful, the Court of Appeal in August, 2020 ruled that “use of automatic facial recognition (AFR) technology by South Wales Police is unlawful”. This favourable outcome has been hailed by many as a big step in the fight against FRT as it is touted to be the world\u0026rsquo;s first legal challenge to police use of facial recognition technology.\nWe hope this analysis helps guide researchers, advocates and groups in India on the path forward for crafting a legal framework for FRT regulation in India that may include banning its deployment for specific purposes.\nFRT regulation around the world Under IFF’s Project Panoptic, we have called for a ban on government entities, police and other security/intelligence agencies using FRT. In this series, we will be taking a look at how our stance measures up against developments on FRT regulations around the world. For the third post in this series we will be focusing on China, so stay in touch with us and keep following Project Panoptic.\nImportant Documents  Project Panoptic’s petition calling for a ban on government use of FRT (link) Facial Recognition Laws in the United States dated May 3, 2021 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/facial-recognition-laws-in-europe-projectpanoptic/","summary":"In the second part of our series on FRT regulation around the world, we will take a look at what are the existing laws regulating FRT in Europe and where regulation is headed.","title":"Facial Recognition Laws in Europe #ProjectPanoptic"},{"content":"            Tl;dr We came across an Order issued by the Collector for the district of Indore, Madhya Pradesh under Section 144(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC). The Order under paragraph 7 prohibited “comments made on Social Media platforms related to breaking of Corona transmission chain in an unrestrained manner” and threatened prosecution for non-compliance. We filed an application under Section 144(5) of CrPC to the Collector seeking withdrawal of this overbroad Order given that it stifles freedom of speech over the internet. Today, in a major victory for constitutional values and free speech in the pandemic, the Collector, Indore issued another order under S.144(6) CrPC repealing paragraph 7 of the previous order, and replacing it with clearer and more specific language, limiting the prohibition only to \u0026ldquo;messages or posts on social media that pose a danger to public peace, law and order, and health of the public, and which violate existing covid protocols”\nBackground Over the past two months, the country has been experiencing a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases. It has been a difficult time for everyone and it has been distressing to see that the Central and State Governments have been busy ordering social media posts to be taken down - including those posts which seek help on social media platforms. On April 23, 2021, at the behest of the Central Government, Twitter blocked over 50 tweets from politicians (including those of a sitting Member of Parliament and a state minister), filmmakers, actors and others critical of the Government’s handling of the pandemic. In response to the clampdown on social media, the Supreme Court, in its order dated April 30, 2021 in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021, directed the Central Government and State Governments to “ensure that they immediately cease any direct or indirect threats of prosecution and arrest to citizens who air grievances or those that are attempting to help fellow citizens receive medical aid”. (Paragraph 61)\nWe released a statement condemning social media censorship and also created video explainers (here and here) discussing the legality of prosecuting individuals for their activities on social media.\nOur May 10 Representation to Collector, Indore In this background, we came across the Order (an English version of the Order follows the original Order) issued by the Collector of the district of Indore, Madhya Pradesh under Section 144(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) dated April 20, 2021. The Order imposed a range of directions to tackle the spread of COVID-19. We were particularly concerned with Paragraph 7 of the Order which stated -\n“7. That the restriction is imposed on the comments made on Social Media platform related to breaking of Corona transmission chain in an unrestrained manner and if any such post will be forwarded/extended forward on social media, then the proceedings will be initiated for violation of The Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, National Disaster Management Act, 2005 and violation of this Order…”\nWe filed an application under Section 144(5) of the CrPC before the Collector, Indore stating the following:\n The order is overbroad: The order prohibits commenting, in an unrestrained manner, on the efforts to tackle COVID-19. ‘Unrestrained manner’ or अनर्गल रूप is a vague, overbroad, and arbitrary standard which is unrecognised in law. By failing to define the ambit clearly, the Order restricts the freedom of speech, and violates the directions of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1. The order has a chilling effect on speech: Individuals in Indore will choose not to express themselves for fear of being prosecuted under this overbroad restriction. As a result of this, information such as those related to availability of life-saving resources may be culled from the public discourse. Thus, the Order violates the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The order is an irregular exercise of the power conferred by Section 144(1), CrPC: Section 144(1) confers upon magistrates the power to impose directions to prevent danger to human life. However, Section 144(1) also requires magistrates to provide material facts based upon which such directions are imposed. The order does not refer to any material which would suggest that the comments on social media have adversely affected the public at large or the battle against COVID-19. The order does not comply with the directions of the Supreme Court’s decision in Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India, (2020) 3 SCC 637: The Order does not employ the least intrusive measure as it disproportionately curbs speech which is otherwise permissible and threatens prosecution, as required by the directions of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin. The order is contrary to observations of the Supreme Court in Suo Motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021: The Supreme Court on April 30, 2021 directed governments to cease any threats of prosecution against citizens who air their grievances on social media (Paragraph 61). Additionally, the Supreme Court also observed that clamping down on the sharing of information pertaining to COVID-19 by private persons is against the interest of the nation and without such information, it is possible that COVID-19 may turn into a tragedy worse that what it already is (Paragraph 63). Comments on the efforts to tackle COVID-19 ensure that the public at large is made aware of any lacunae in the ongoing battle and thus, the administration in turn is able to address those lacunae. The Order, however, prevents individuals from making such bona fide comments because of fear of prosecution and thus has the propensity to adversely impact the battle against COVID-19.  Accordingly, we called upon the Collector, Indore to\n Rescind the order under Section 144(5) of the CrPC by appropriately modifying Paragraph 7 therein; and Publish the rescission order on the website of the district administration (http:/indore.nic.in/).  A welcome reply from the Collector! Today, the Collector, Indore issued another order (the translated version follows the order) under Section 144(6) CrPC, in response to our application under Section 144(5) CrPC. In the revised order, the Collector, Indore referred to our representation to him dated May 10, 2021 and stated that on the basis of IFF’s representation, paragraph 7 of the previous S.144 order is hereby repealed, and replaced with the following paragraph (translated from Hindi):\n\u0026ldquo;That such messages or posts, posted on Social Media which present danger towards public peace, law and order and health of the general public at large and which become the reason for violation of prevailing Covid Protocol, will remain restrained”.\nThis is a major victory for the constitutional rights of all residents of Indore, since the revised order is clearer, more specific and limited in its scope only to issues of law and order and the health of the public, whereas the previous order prohibited any and all comments made in an “unrestrained manner” in relation to Covid-19. The revised order has removed vague and arbitrary phrases such as “provoking the public” and “unrestrained commenting”.\nNotably, the revised order also removes the threat of prosecution under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, as was contained in paragraph 7 of the previous order. The direction to group admins to immediately expel group members for “posting wrong messages” has also been removed.\nThe revised order has not yet been uploaded to the official website of the administration of the Indore district. We will update you once it is.\nWe are grateful to the Collector, Indore for his swift action to ensure that measures to tackle Covid-19 do not violate or compromise the fundamental rights of the residents of Indore. This will allow us not only to use social media to coordinate vital help and assistance to patients, but also to exercise our constitutional right to express our views and opinions on all matters relating to the ongoing pandemic, including the government’s response to it.\nWe also call upon our community to share similar orders that may violate your fundamental right of speech online from your home districts with us.\nImportant Documents  Order dated May 12, 2021 issued by Collector, Indore replacing paragraph 7 of the previous order under S. 144(1) CrPC (link) Application under Section 144(5), CrPC addressed to Collector, Indore dated May 10, 2021 (link) Order issued by the Collector, District of Indore under Section 144(1) CrPC dated April 20, 2021 (link) Supreme Court order in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021 dated April 30, 2021 (link) IFF’s statement condemning social media censorship of posts seeking or providing COVID-19 relief April 25, 2021 (link) IFF’s video discussing the legality of orders taking down COVID-19 relief work dated April 26, 2021 (link) IFF’s video discussing the liability of WhatsApp group administrators for content posted by others dated May 5, 2021 (link)        ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/indore-collectors-welcome-response/","summary":"Today, in a major victory for online free speech, the Collector, Indore issued an order repealing paragraph 7 of Indore\u0026rsquo;s 144 order, and replacing it with clearer language, prohibiting only posts \u0026ldquo;that pose a danger to public peace, law and order, and health of the public\u0026rdquo;","title":"Indore Collector's welcome response - problematic paragraph repealed"},{"content":"            Tl;dr In 2015, the Supreme Court struck down S. 66A of Information Technology Act, 2000. Yet the provision continues to be enforced. IFF along with Civic Data Labs (CDL) built Zombie Tracker by relying on data available on the eCourts platform to track the cases which included a charge under S. 66A. While building the Zombie Tracker we faced difficulties on the eCourts platform which impeded our ability to conduct research. We, along with CDL, have now written to Hon’ble Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Chairperson of the e-Committee, Supreme Court of India. In the letter, we have highlighted the difficulties we faced on the eCourts platform and provided our recommendations in a hope that our efforts enable others to conduct data-driven research of judicial trends.\nBackground As most of you know, S. 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) criminalised “offensive speech” over the internet. This provision was used to suppress dissent across the political spectrum. In March, 2015 the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India \u0026amp; Ors., (2015) 5 SCC 1 (Shreya Singhal) declared that the provision was void ab initio, i.e. was deemed to never have existed on the statute books as it violated Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution (summary).\nAs a result of this judgment, all pending cases should have been dismissed and no fresh cases should have been instituted under S. 66A. However, in 2018 a research paper by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta demonstrated that Section 66A was being used to prosecute individuals all over the country. Taking note of the research paper, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), one of the original petitioners in Shreya Singhal, with assistance from IFF, approached the Supreme Court in January, 2019. PUCL sought directions from the Supreme Court to ensure implementation of the decision in Shreya Singhal. In February, 2019 the Supreme Court directed the Union of India to ensure compliance of its decision by making available copies of the judgment to Chief Secretaries across the country. The Chief Secretaries, in turn, were directed to sensitise police departments across the country.\nIFF and CDL develop Zombie Tracker Despite the directions of the Supreme Court, we came across reports which showed that S. 66A was still being invoked in fresh cases and pending cases were not being dismissed. Therefore, in collaboration with Civic Data Labs (CDL) we built a platform - Zombie Tracker - to track cases which include a charge under S. 66A. The Zombie Tracker provides details of S. 66A cases registered between 27.10.2009 and 15.02.2020 (both ongoing and disposed of cases) in 11 states of the country. Data generated from Zombie Tacker bolsters our advocacy efforts to ensure such cases are dismissed and fresh cases are not registered. As of 08.05.2021, our findings indicate that as many as 810 cases appear to be pending and active before the district courts in 11 States.\nDifficulties we faced on the eCourts platform We collected the findings on Zombie Tracker from the eCourts platform, as no government agency such as the National Crime Records Bureau collects data on prosecution under S.66A of the IT Act. The eCourts platform has been built under the aegis of the e-Committee of the Supreme Court to provide information related to cases before district courts across the country. The eCourts platform contains important data points (such as date of filing, hearing, disposal) and metadata (such as the provision under which a suit is filed and details of the lower court) about a case.\nTo build the Zombie Tracker, we initially used the “Search by Act/Section'' feature to obtain a list of all cases registered under a S. 66A of IT Act for every district court establishment and then we downloaded those cases. After a round of collection we observed that the data was incomplete. This was because the eCourt website permitted selection of standardised values while selecting an Act, but one needed to manually write the name of the section related to which they wanted cases. This meant that cases which were not tagged as ‘Section 66A’ did not show up in our initial data set. Thus, to ensure that the data is complete, we downloaded all cases under the IT Act and then manually selected cases registered under Section 66A to arrive at our findings.\nWhile conducting this exercise we face the following major difficulties -\n Non-Standardization: Cases which included a charge under S.66A were tagged as under the IT Act, but not as a 66A case under the section tags. Some cases including a charge under S.66A were tagged as S.66a (or another variation including a combination of components “Section” or “Sec” and “66” and “a” or “A”). The lack of standardisation also extended to Act names. For example, we found that the IT Act was variously referred to as “Information Technology Act”, “INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT, 2000”, “Information Technology Act, 2000”, “INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT 2000”, “IT (Information Technology) Act”, “Information Technology”, “Information Technology Act 2000”, and “INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT 2008”. Incomplete data set: During the period between 27.10.2009 to 15.02.2020, according to data available on the eCourts platform, 1988 cases were registered with a charge under S.66A of the IT Act. Of these cases, 1189 cases were tagged as disposed of by the eCourts platform. However, only 19.8% of the disposed of cases have a judgement uploaded in the case file, as available via the eCourts platform. Due to the non-availability of judgements, it was impossible to completely verify the accuracy of “Section” and “Act” tags used on the eCourts platform. This, in turn, may have resulted in certain cases under section 66A being excluded from our dataset, due to lack of verification.  Joint Letter to Hon’ble Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud On 6th May, 2021 we along with CDL wrote a joint letter to Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Chairperson of the e-Committee, Supreme Court of India. In the letter, we highlighted the above issues we faced in our research and have requested him to take steps to improve the eCourt platform which would encourage independent data driven research in India. We have recommended that the eCourts platform should a) provide access to raw data after complying with the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy; b) standardise fields; and c) ensure that the data set is complete. We believe that if these recommendations are complied with, researchers across the country will be able to analyse judicial trends. In particular, exercises similar to Zombie Tracker could be conducted for other provisions which have been held unconstitutional but are still being invoked by law enforcement agencies.\nWe are hopeful that the Hon’ble Justice considers our suggestions and our efforts improve the accessibility of the eCourts platform.\nPlease note that this letter is independent to our participation in the consultation process of the Draft Vision Document for the eCourts Project Phase III. We are in the process of separately offering our inputs to that document, which we will share with you once we have submitted them. We encourage you to engage with the Draft Vision document and participate in the process by submitting your comments on ecommittee@aij.gov.in.

The provisions under the Bill for processing of data without the consent of data principals are vague and undermine the right to privacy. Furthermore, the lack of clarity on the consequences for withdrawal of consent can even result in the denial of essential services. To address these issues, we suggest certain changes that must be incorporated into wording of the Bill.\nBackground Last time in part 2, we looked at how non-personal data could be processed by various entities without user consent. This time, we will look at how the Bill treats consent in general. Consent is the cornerstone of a robust data protection regime. Consent places the control of personal data with its owners. It gives you the choice to determine whether or not to be subjected to certain types of processing of data. The consent contemplated under the Bill is ‘informed and meaningful’ consent. Consent is said to be valid under the Bill, if it is; given freely, informed, specific, clearly expressed, and is capable of being withdrawn. While these provisions appear well grounded, there are certain carve outs to consent under the Bill such as exceptions to the State, employers etc., which make them less effective and debilitate user’s control over their personal data. It is thus important for us to examine the exceptions to consent under the Bill and understand how it affects our rights under the Bill.\nThe issue: Overbroad exceptions The exceptions to consent begin with clause 12, which inter alia allows the State to process personal data without the consent of data principals for certain purposes, such as for providing services, benefits, or for the issuance of any certification, licence or permit for any action or activity of the data principal. The exceptions to State under clause 12 essentially legitimise the collection and processing of personal data by the State for projects like Aadhar.\nThe Sri Krishna Committee report emphasises the need to restrict the exception given to the State for carrying out welfare and regulatory functions to only those entities which are performing functions directly connected to such activities. The report warns that a large part of the functioning of various departments of the government may be indirectly or remotely connected to the promotion of public welfare or regulatory functions, and this ground should not be used for justifying the processing of personal data for all such functions. In this context, the Committee made the recommendation that the availability of this exception should be restricted to certain entities of the State and certain functions to avoid vagueness in the law. However, from the text of clause 12 we can discern that such restrictions are missing.\nThe processing of data by the State is prescribed under Principle 4 of the Indian Privacy Code, a progressive and rights-based data protection legislation based on multistakeholder collaboration with data protection experts and lawyers. The Code states that the government is responsible for the delivery of many essential services to the public of India and that individuals cannot be forced to trade away their data at the altar of being permitted to use government services and access legal entitlements on welfare. Therefore, any provision which allows the State to collect personal data for providing services or benefits, should not be vague and should respect the informational privacy of the data principals.\nDenial of services based on a lack of consent Though the Bill does not explicitly state that services can be denied to the data principals for want of consent, there are some provisions under the Bill, which when read together, can lead to denial of services. The provisions on consent are set out under clause 11, which inter alia states that the provision of any goods or services, or the performance of any contract, or the enjoyment of any legal right or claim, should not be denied on the ground that no consent was obtained for the processing of any personal data not necessary for that purpose. In the same breath, the clause also states that if the data principal withdraws their consent from the processing of any personal data without any valid reason, all legal consequences for the effects of such withdrawal will have to be borne by such data principal. This clause is very vaguely worded as there is no clarity on what amounts to a valid reason and what are the legal consequences that the data principals will have to face. Since there is no express bar on denial of essential services, it is possible that such legal consequences may also include denial of essential services. This is a valid concern, for instances of exclusion from essential services are plenty in the country. We have already seen this during the ongoing pandemic, as Aadhaar has been made mandatory for the receipt of several healthcare services such as hospital beds, COVID-19 tests, and oxygen cylinders. Patients have even been denied healthcare in certain cases.\nEmployers as Big Brother Workplace surveillance has become a common feature of workspaces across India in recent times, with the increased use of CCTV cameras, biometric attendance systems, and other technologies being reported. The use of such pervasive technologies is undesirable and we have always voiced our dissent against their use. The Bill does not do much to allay workplace surveillance, as clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from obtaining the consent of the employees for the purposes of recruitment or termination of employees, for delivering services to employees, for verifying the attendance of employees or for the assessment of the performance of the employees. This exception is available only if seeking consent of the data principal would be inappropriate given the employer-employee relationship or would involve a disproportionate amount of effort on the part of the data fiduciary due to the nature of the processing involved in the clause.\nThe exception given to employers is broad and poses a grave threat to the privacy of the employees. Here, it is important to refer to Article 88 of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which deals with processing of data in the context of employment. The Article affords more protection to the data and informational privacy of the employees. It formulates that any rule for the processing of the data of employees in the context of employment should have specific measures to safeguard the human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights of employees, especially with regard to transparency of processing and workplace monitoring systems.\nFurthermore, this exception can lead to violation of the fundamental rights of the employees guaranteed under the Constitution of India. In our public brief on workplace surveillance we have deliberated how workplace surveillance violates the fundamental rights of the employees. Workplace surveillance can aggravate the existing power imbalance between employees and employers, and can adversely impact the fundamental right of employees to form associations or unions guaranteed under Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. Also, it is needless to say, the use of pervasive surveillance technologies by employers could amount to disproportionate encroachment on the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.\nHow reasonable are the ‘reasonable purposes’ for processing data? Clause 14 of the Bill allows the processing of personal data without our consent for certain purposes that are considered as “reasonable”. This is a residuary clause to cover the grounds that are useful to the society but are not covered by the grounds for non-consensual processing of data enumerated in Chapter III of the Bill. The Bill also gives a suggestive list of grounds of processing personal data that would amount to reasonable purposes. We find certain grounds contained therein as concerning.\nThe Bill includes publicly available personal data as one of the reasonable purposes for processing of personal data without consent. This exception stems from the fundamentally flawed notion that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in public places. We believe that this ground can become a backdoor to profiling of individuals. The government as well as the big techs would no longer require the consent of individuals for aggregating their social networking activities and their sentiments on various issues.\nAnother interesting ground that has found place under reasonable purposes is the operation of search engines. This was not present in the previous draft of the Bill. The reason for its inclusion remains unknown. The operation of search engines range from simple indexing to profiling of users. The extent and scope of operations of search engines that would constitute a reasonable purpose is not clear.\nSolution: Clear definitions, limited exceptions, and clarity It is no doubt that certain exceptions are necessary in order to facilitate a functional data protection regime. However, as we have mentioned in the second principle of the Indian Privacy Code, these exceptions can, if not worded clearly, end up swallowing the rule. Therefore, any exception should be worded clearly, limited in purpose, necessary and proportionate to the aim, and accompanied by sufficient procedural safeguards. Therefore, to prevent the abuse of the exceptions to processing of data without consent, all such exceptions must be in line with these safeguards.\nThe Bill should also provide in explicit terms that essential services cannot be denied for want of personal data or at the very least be based on the impossibility of providing the service. Further, for processing of data in the context of employment, as we have previously stated in our public brief on workplace surveillance, information regarding trade union affiliation, which can be used by employers to target employees, should be categorised as sensitive personal data to put the processing of such data out of the purview of the exception under clause 13 of the Bill. The principles of necessity and proportionality as articulated in the Justice KS Puttaswamy vs Union of India judgement of the Supreme Court on right to privacy should be incorporated into clause 13 so that the employers will be forced to resort to less privacy intrusive employee monitoring programmes, necessary to protect the interest of the employers and to thwart the risks to them. Further, the Data Protection Authority, which is the regulatory body proposed by the Bill, should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under clause 50 of the Bill. Employees must be consulted and their views must be sought before processing personal data under clause 13 of the Bill. It is important to incorporate these safeguards into the Bill to ensure that consent, which is the bedrock of our data protection regime, is secure.\nThis is the third post in our series on the issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

As people across the country battle the second wave of COVID-19, ensuring equitable, fast and easy access to healthcare, medicines and the vaccines is critical. The undersigned organizations and persons call on the Central Government, State Governments, Health Secretaries of the Union and the States, and the District Magistrates to ensure that the vaccination process focuses on increasing reach and accessibility, that there are no onerous ID requirements, including Aadhaar, for access to health services or vaccinations, and that health data is not misused.\nDon’t let the “largest” vaccination drive become the most discriminatory On 23 April, 2021, the Government of India announced the “largest vaccination drive,” in Phase III of the National Vaccination Strategy under the “Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy”. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has subsequently sent a letter to State Secretaries. These two documents lay out the following conditions for Phase III of the vaccination, in which persons between the ages of 18-45 are eligible for the vaccine:\n State governments and private hospitals will have to directly procure the vaccines from manufacturers The price for the vaccines will be self-set/declared in advance by vaccine manufacturers. There is no regulation, but only “monitoring,” of the price that private hospitals will charge for vaccination. Persons in the 18-45 age group will not be provided vaccination by the Central Government but will instead have to be taken care of by the state governments (whether paid or without payment). Those in the 18-45 age group can only register for the vaccine online, through the CoWIN platform, without an option to walk-in and register.     These measures will only exacerbate difficulties in accessing the vaccine.  The class and rural-urban divide in the previous vaccination phases have already been highlighted by civil society groups like the All India People’s Science Network and others. We echo these concerns:\n Leaving the pricing of vaccines to the free market and the responsibility of vaccination of a large population to states who are low on resources and where negotiating capacity can impose a barrier to peoples’ access to vaccination. Mandating online self-registration for vaccination without a walk-in facility will further entrench inequities in access to the vaccine. Only those with access to the internet and who can operate an app-based system will be able to register themselves, or will register themselves ahead of others, leaving the poor and vulnerable behind, creating an enormous divide in access to the vaccine.  Unless these conditions are changed, the “largest” vaccination drive could turn into the most discriminatory, and further entrench inequities.\nNo to Aadhaar for access to Healthcare Amidst distressing reports of hospitals running out of oxygen and medicines, there have been accounts that hospitals, private suppliers and state governments are mandating Aadhaar for access to diagnostics, medicines, oxygen supplies, and the vaccine. This must be stopped immediately. Onerous identity requirements cannot be made a precondition to access lifesaving resources.\n In Maharashtra, it is mandatory to show Aadhaar card, the results of a positive test and a doctor\u0026rsquo;s prescription for citizens to purchase Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. The Bombay High Court has made it mandatory for all those venturing out on the roads, including doctors and medical staff, in 11 districts of Marathwada, Maharashtra to carry their Aadhaar cards. In Ahmedabad, admission in AMC run COVID hospitals mandate needs Aadhaar card with local address. In Gurgaon, on the government’s emergency portal, persons cannot register for a hospital bed without Aadhaar cards that too with a Gurugram address. Across multiple states and cities, the Aadhaar card of the patient and attendant are being mandated to hand over oxygen cylinders.     Screenshot from Gurugram portal  The pandemic cannot be used to test out new technology Persons in power, like RS Sharma, the CEO of the National Health Authority, have made irresponsible statements about introducing new technologies for the vaccination process, including rolling out facial authentication, which civil society groups have strongly opposed. India is the only country to test facial recognition for the vaccination process. The pandemic, which has stretched our people and societies to the breaking point, is not a time to test out new technologies.\nNo to the “data tax” The National Health Authority, (NHA), which does not function under any enabling law, has been rolling out National Health IDs as part of the vaccination drive, for all persons who register for the vaccine using their Aadhaar numbers. This is unwise, not backed by law and unethical. It would take significant time to ensure informed consent is obtained from those who register before a National Health ID is issued. The NHA itself has not disclosed how this process works and is silently rolling it out without informing the general public. We cannot permit the government or private entities to piggyback on a crisis, and use it to roll out the National Health ID, or use this data in any manner, without public debate or a law.\nThe pandemic should not be used to collect more data and develop the National Digital Health Stack. As public interest technologist, Anivar Aravind, has warned, mandating that all vaccinations are routed through the government’s Co-WIN platform, without a clear understanding of how the data will be used, amounts to enforcing a “data tax” by the Government of India. The Co-WIN platform includes a hidden consent collection method for health ID generation, is designed to permit the sharing of health data, and the generation of a Digilocker linked Vaccination certificate (Digilocker is the government’s document sharing system which can be accessed via Aadhaar numbers or cell-phone linkage).\nThe demand to safeguard health data is not an abstract right. It lies at the heart of the right to privacy, to dignity and protects people from private health players and data brokers. Any measures seeking to encroach on this right must be backed by a law, and meet the constitutional standard of being necessary and proportionate for a legitimate aim.\nOur Demands The undersigned persons and organisations call on the government to:\n Increase access to vaccinationsa. Allow walk-in access for all vaccinations.b. Remove all onerous identity requirements for access to the vaccine.c. Ensure the vaccines are taken to eligible populations at community level.d. Ensure Vaccination certificates do not affect people\u0026rsquo;s right to movement and access and further entrench inequities. Ensure there are no barriers, including mandating Aadhaar, for access to diagnostics, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, medication or any other treatment. Protect people\u0026rsquo;s rights over their dataa. Ensure the CoWin platform is not made mandatory for registrations for vaccinations.b. Ensure that vaccination is not used to as a way for hidden consent collection for health ID generation \u0026amp; data sharingc. Ensure that Proof of vaccination must not be linked to Digilocker, or Aarogya Setu.d. Move the Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) reporting to a system without direct linkage to patient’s data. The alternate system must be built with participatory consultation, involving health care expertise and ground level involvement of state health departments, Hospitals and ICMR. Permit vaccination for all without ID proof or proof of residence.

At this time, it is important for the Government to not curb speech. Free speech helps the spread of vital information such as lacunae in government policy, and is instrumental in tackling the pandemic. In fact, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India on April 30, 2021 noted the importance of not clamping down on speech. In this background, we came across an Order issued by Shri Manish Singh, the Collector for the district of Indore, Madhya Pradesh under Section 144(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The Order prohibits “comments made on Social Media platforms related to breaking of Corona transmission chain in an unrestrained manner” and threatens prosecution for non-compliance. We have filed an application to the Collector seeking withdrawal of this overbroad Order given that it stifles freedom of speech over the internet.\nBackground Over the past two months, the country has been experiencing a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases. However problematic Big Tech may be otherwise, in these times, social media has played an incredibly important role in ensuring that Indians are able to crowdsource scarce resources such as oxygen, medicines, plasma and even patient care. As this report points out, over 3,56,000 ordinary citizens have taken to Twitter to seek help between March 1, 2021 and April 21, 2021. In addition to this, social media has also been essential in holding the Government accountable. In view of the oxygen shortage across the country, it is almost a public duty to ask the Government to take steps to remedy the situation.\nIn this background, it has been distressing to see that the Central and State Governments have been ordering social media posts to be taken down - including those posts which seek help on social media platforms. On April 23, 2021, at the behest of the Central Government, Twitter blocked over 50 tweets from politicians (including those of a sitting Member of Parliament and a state minister), filmmakers, actors and others critical of the Government’s handling of the pandemic. In response to the clampdown on social media, the Supreme Court, in its order dated April 30, 2021 in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021, directed the Central Government and State Governments to “ensure that they immediately cease any direct or indirect threats of prosecution and arrest to citizens who air grievances or those that are attempting to help fellow citizens receive medical aid”. (Paragraph 61) __\nWe released a statement condemning social media censorship and also created video explainers (here and here) discussing the legality of prosecuting individuals for their activities on social media.\nLegality of Indore’s Section 144(1) CrPC order In this background, we came across the Order (an English version of the Order follows the original Order) issued by the Collector of the district of Indore, Madhya Pradesh under Section 144(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) dated April 20, 2021. The Order imposes a range of directions which purportedly ensure that the spread of COVID-19 is restricted. We are particularly concerned with Paragraph 7 of the Order which states -\n“7. That the restriction is imposed on the comments made on Social Media platform related to breaking of Corona transmission chain in an unrestrained manner and if any such post will be forwarded/extended forward on social media, then the proceedings will be initiated for violation of The Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, National Disaster Management Act, 2005 and violation of this Order…”\nImposing on restriction of comments in such a broad manner is a patently disproportionate measure to tackle any underlying concerns. Moreover, according to us, the measure is ill-advised, adversely affects the battle against COVID-19, and is not permissible in law for the following reasons:\n The order is overbroad: The order prohibits commenting, in an unrestrained manner, on the efforts to tackle COVID-19. ‘Unrestrained manner’ or अनर्गल रूप is a vague, overbroad, and arbitrary standard which is unrecognised in law. Certainly some comments made in an ‘unrestrained manner’ may be impermissible in law. However, the lack of specificity also prohibits comments which are bona fide, otherwise permissible in law and which do not present any danger to human life, health or safety. By failing to define the ambit clearly, the Order restricts the freedom of speech. The order has a chilling effect on speech: The Order, because of the threat of prosecution it carries, has a chilling effect on free speech. This implies that individuals in Indore will choose not to express themselves for fear of being prosecuted under this overbroad restriction. As a result of this, information such as those related to availability of life-saving resources may be culled from the public discourse. Thus, the Order violates the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The order is an irregular exercise of the power conferred by Section 144(1), CrPC: Section 144(1) confers upon magistrates the power to impose directions to prevent danger to human life. However, Section 144(1) also requires magistrates to provide material facts based upon which such directions are imposed. The order does not refer to any material which would suggest that the comments on social media have adversely affected the public at large or the battle against COVID-19. The order does not comply with the directions of the Supreme Court’s decision in Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India, (2020) 3 SCC 637: In Anuradha Bhasin, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India directed magistrates to apply least intrusive measures while imposing Section 144, so as to balance fundamental rights (Paragraph 152). The Order does not employ the least intrusive measure as it disproportionately curbs speech which is otherwise permissible and threatens prosecution. We have provided a summary of the decision in Anuradha Bhasin here. The order is contrary to observations of the Supreme Court in Suo Motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021: As we have mentioned above, the Supreme Court on April 30, 2021 directed governments to cease any threats of prosecution against citizens who air their grievances on social media (Paragraph 61). Additionally, the Supreme Court also observed that clamping down on the sharing of information pertaining to COVID-19 by private persons is against the interest of the nation and without such information, it is possible that COVID-19 may turn into a tragedy worse that what it already is (Paragraph 63). Comments on the efforts to tackle COVID-19 ensure that the public at large is made aware of any lacunae in the ongoing battle and thus, the administration in turn is able to address those lacunae. The Order, however, prevents individuals from making such bona fide comments because of fear of prosecution and thus has the propensity to adversely impact the battle against COVID-19.  Application under Section 144(5), CrPC addressed to Collector, Indore To ensure that individuals residing in the district of Indore do not get unreasonably prosecuted for voicing their opinion on social media, we have filed an application under Section 144(5) addressed to the Collector of Indore. Section 144(5), CrPC allows the Collector to rescind/alter any order made under Section 144(1) on an application of any aggrieved person. In our application, we have made the following demands:\n Rescind the order under Section 144(5) of the CrPC by appropriately modifying Paragraph 7 therein. Publish the rescission order on the website of the district administration (http:/indore.nic.in/).  We are hopeful our application will be taken into consideration by the Collector. Notably, Section 144(7) requires the Collector to provide us an opportunity of appearing before him regarding this application to show cause against the order. We are willing to appear before him for a virtual hearing, whenever his office requires.\nImportant Documents  Application under Section 144(5), CrPC addressed to Collector, Indore dated May 10, 2021 (link) Order issued by the Collector, District of Indore under Section 144(1) CrPC dated April 20, 2021 (link) Supreme Court order in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2021 dated April 30, 2021 (link) IFF’s statement condemning social media censorship of posts seeking or providing COVID-19 relief April 25, 2021 (link) IFF’s video discussing the legality of orders taking down COVID-19 relief work dated April 26, 2021 (link) IFF’s video discussing the liability of WhatsApp group administrators for content posted by others dated May 5, 2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/indore-administration-curbs-speech-on-social-media/","summary":"Indore administration issued an over-broad order under Section 144(1) CrPC, 1973 banning speech related to Covid-19 on social media platforms.

We immediately wrote to the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) requesting that the accounts be restored, and that the blocking orders be disclosed. MeitY responded to us on 26th April, 2021 saying that their actions were authorised by law, and that they are not required to disclose the blocking orders. We have written back to the Ministry this week explaining how they are constitutionally required to disclose the blocking orders under relevant law, and according to the directions of the Supreme Court.\nBackground On the 1st of February this year, news emerged that multiple Twitter accounts had been blocked in response to a legal request from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Based on the reports, it seemed as if close to 250 accounts, belonging to a diverse group of entities such as news media organisations, politicians, activists, and farmers groups, were reported to have been blocked.\nWhile Twitter subsequently restored the blocked accounts by the evening of 1st February after significant public outrage, concerns about secrecy, proportionality and arbitrariness have been raised. Furthermore, on February 3rd, the Ministry is reported to have sent an order to Twitter warning it about this decision.\nThe Ministry, pointing to Twitter’s obligations as an intermediary bound by Centre’s guidelines under section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, asked Twitter to comply with the earlier order or face criminal proceedings with penal consequences of imprisonment for up to 7 years. A press note also seems to have been privately circulated amongst various media outlets that provided further details about the same and outlined both the rationale behind the initial order as well as the Centre’s stance on Twitter’s response. Kindly note that this press note was not made public and neither were the legal orders under which the blocking directions were issued.\nOn 8th February, fresh reports emerged of a new order having been sent by the Ministry on 4th February, sharing a list of 1,178 more accounts that it wanted removed. Twitter subsequently put out a blogpost in which they said that:\n They had undertaken a range of enforcement actions against more than 500 accounts that MeitY had escalated. Further, had taken steps to reduce the visibility of hashtags containing harmful content. They had withheld a portion of accounts identified in the blocking orders within India only, though these accounts would be visible outside India. No action was taken against the accounts of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians, as Twitter believed this would violate their fundamental right to free expression.  These events demonstrated that there was an unconstitutional and disproportionate exercise of censorship. What makes this worse, is that there was little public disclosure of the legal orders even when it impacted the fundamental right to receive information that is a part of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.\nRepresentation by IFF We wrote a representation to MeitY on the 8th of February. In our letter, we pointed out that such actions are harmful not only for operational transparency but also for India’s democratic ethos. The representation focussed on the following three points:\n The secrecy and lack of a clear process of a prior notice and hearing with respect to the blocking of the accounts under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 is constitutionally inconsistent. Additionally, the directions themselves, which would contain the reasons for why the accounts have been directed to be suspended, have not been made public. This directly impacts the users of the accounts with respect to their fundamental rights to freedom of speech and expression and access to judicial remedies. Furthermore, it is in breach of the directions of the Supreme Court in the Shreya Singhal (paras 117, 118, \u0026amp; 119) and Anuradha Bhasin Judgements (paras 15, 16, 17, \u0026amp; 18) that recognise the public’s right to receive public information and any censorship for it being as per principles of transparency and proactive disclosures.  MEITY Responds On 26th April, 2021, MEITY emailed us their response to our letter. This response is being published in full for the sake of transparency. They have justified actions taken by them, refused to recall their orders and defended the secrecy of the legal orders issued by them. The top points which emerge from their response are set out below:\n The Ministry has followed the due process necessary under section 69A and the Blocking Rules. The former was found to be constitutionally valid in the Shreya Singhal vs Union of India judgement of the Supreme Court. Under Rule 16 of the Blocking Rules, all requests and complaints received and all actions taken thereof shall be confidential. Thus, the directions to block the Twitter accounts were fair and followed the course of the law. However, they cannot be made public due to the obligation of confidentiality.  Basically, as one might have expected, they said that they did nothing wrong.\nOur rejoinder Earlier this week, on May 5, we responded to MeitY urging them once again to make the available the blocking orders pursuant to which the 250 or so accounts were taken down. We pointed out that disclosing such blocking orders is necessary to bring the actions of MeitY in accordance with the requirements of the IT Act, 2000, the directions of the Supreme Court, constitutional values, and the principles of natural justice.\nMeitY had claimed that it was authorised under Section 69A of the IT Act to issue the blocking orders, and relied on Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015) 5 SCC 1 to say that Section 69A of the IT Act had been upheld as constitutionally valid by the Supreme Court. We explained in our letter that Section 69A of the IT Act was indeed held to be constitutionally valid under Shreya Singhal, but subject certain specific safeguards. These safeguards stipulate that reasons have to be recorded in writing in such blocking order so that they may be assailed in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution (paragraph 114 of Shreya Singhal). Further, according to paragraph 115 of Shreya Singhal, where the originator is identified, which in the present case is true for many blocked twitter accounts, the originator must be presented an opportunity to be heard before a blocking order is passed, under Rule 8 of the Blocking Rules. Even in instances of emergency blocking, a post-decisional hearing must be provided. We pointed out that no such opportunity was afforded to the accounts that were disabled.\nMeitY also relied on Rule 16 of the Blocking Rules to claim confidentiality of the blocking orders. We pointed out that this was premised on an incorrect understanding of the Rules. The confidentiality requirement of Rule 16 pertains to the complaints received by MeitY on the basis of which it took the action, and does not mean that the blocking orders issued by MeitY are also to be kept confidential. Such a reading of Rule 16 would be unconstitutional, and would also violate the directions of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal (2015) 5 SCC 1 (paragraphs 112, 114, 115) __ and Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India (2020) SCC 3 637 (paragraphs 23, 24, 25).\nOn the basis of these reasons, we urged MeitY once again to uphold constitutional values and the spirit of transparency, in this and in future cases. We will keep you updated on the Ministry’s response to us. Our belief is centered from constitutional values that transparency in any act of censorship is necessary not only for legality but for maintaining the democratic values of public trust.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s rejoinder to MeitY’s dated May 05, 2021 (link) MeitY’s email response dated April 26, 2021 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s letter dated February 8, 2021 to MeitY regarding \u0026lsquo;Secretive and disproportionate directions issued to Twitter under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000\u0026rsquo; (link) Our previous post dated February 8, 2021, titled ‘Government censorship and the dire need for transparency’ (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/meity-response-to-representation/","summary":"In February, we had written to MeitY with regards to the blocking of Twitter accounts.

This basically allows them to profit over your personal data without your consent! Here we first examine the provisions in the Bill on government access to non-personal data and setting up of privacy sandboxes, and then discuss potential changes that could be made to include a more rights based perspective on non-personal data.\nBackground Picking up where we left off in Part 1 of this series on the issues with the Personal Data protection Bill, 2019, this post is a continuation of previously raised concerns. The muddled objectives of the Bill have resulted in the inclusion of some provisions that do not really fit into the rubric of data protection. Hence, in this post we shall discuss these provisions and how they affect the privacy of the people. So, without any further ado, let’s get started!\nThe Issue: The use and misuse of Non-Personal Data The provision that we are concerned with is Section 91 of the Bill. According to the Section, the Central Government can frame policies for the promotion of digital economy so long as the policy does not cover personal data. However, it does not stop there; the Section goes on to state that the Central government can, after consulting the Data Protection Authority, direct any data fiduciary or data processor to share any anonymised personal data or other non-personal data to enable better targeting of delivery of services or formulation of evidence-based policies.\nBefore we dive into the issues with the provision, we need to understand non-personal data and anonymised personal data. Anonymised data is such data that meets the standard of irreversibility or anonymisation as prescribed by the authority, and is in a form in which the data principal cannot be de-identified as per the prescribed standards of irreversibility. To begin with, anonymised data has been exempted from all the other provisions of the Bill. Till here, things seem to be fine. But what becomes a bit more concerning, is “non-personal data” that has been very conveniently defined under the Bill as any data other than personal data. The definition of non-personal data given under the Bill **** is problematic as it does not provide any clarity on what it actually is and how it can be delineated from personal data. We have discussed at length the problems with distinguishing between personal data and non-personal data in our comments to the draft framework for the governance of non-personal data. In that we have highlighted that non-personal data is a very ambiguous concept and that ascertaining the degree of identifiability of a data-point can be a convoluted process in the context of both implementation and jurisprudence.\nSimilarly, the definition of anonymised personal data is also not comprehensive, and it does not address the possibility of identification of the individuals. A seemingly innocuous non-personal data or anonymised data when combined with other datasets can cause the deleterious effect of de-identification and targeting of the individuals to whom the data pertains. The threat of de-identification of anonymised data and the consequent violation of privacy of individuals is very grave as the underlying data is personal data.\nDespite the concerns raised by non-personal data and anonymised data, the Government still wants access to them. It appears that the only possible rationale for this approach of the Government is that it sees data as a resource which needs to be harnessed at any rate for the growth of the digital economy of the country. What is equally worrying is that Section 91 serves as kind of an exemption to the Government which grants it the power to demand non-personal data or anonymised data from data fiduciaries and use it however they want, without having any regard for the security of the underlying personal data.\nSandboxes to play with your data! By making provision for sandboxes lacking adequate safeguards for personal data protection, the Bill peaks at favouring businesses and the growth of the digital economy over the protection of informational privacy of individuals. A regulatory sandbox is set up for the testing of new products or services under a controlled environment with relaxation in certain regulatory requirements. A data sandbox is where data is accessed and analysed in an isolated environment. It gives the innovators access to sensitive and proprietary data while respecting the privacy and intellectual property rights of the rights holders. The Bill creates a provision for sandboxes in order to encourage innovation in artificial intelligence, machine-learning or other emerging technology in public interest.\nThis provision is worrisome; firstly because the term ‘sandbox’ is not defined anywhere in the Bill. Secondly, it falls under chapter VIII, which provides for exemptions from the provisions of the Bill. The necessary implication of this is that data fiduciaries get exemption from the core data protection principles such as consent, purpose specification, collection limitation, and storage limitation. Such exemptions could have detrimental effects on the right to privacy of the individuals.\nSolution: A rights-based approach to non-personal data The provisions for Government access to non-personal data and privacy sandbox are unique to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. The fundamental considerations behind these provisions are the economic interests of the State, and thus it is a stark deviation from the ultimate objective of data protection legislation: the protection of informational privacy of individuals. Thus, these provisions must be deleted.\nWe had voiced similar concerns when we provided our submission on the second version of the Draft Report of the Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework. In our submission, we had recommended that:\n Non-personal data be regulated under the Data Protection Authority proposed by the PDPB. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for NPD. Questions about the fostering of growth in the sector can then be handled in consonance with an approach that safeguards user data. Doing so would also strengthen institutional independence, reduce confusion and minimise the potential risks and faulty premises adopted by the second version of the Draft Non-Personal Data Report. This becomes necessary in light of issues of the ease of de-anonymisation, since a proactive approach in which robust guidelines for anonymisation procedures are mandated and enforced (in addition to any retroactive procedures) may be better equipped to deal with the emerging threats posed by de-anonymisation. Subsequently, the Data Protection Authority must junk an approach that directly enables the over-extraction of data and the formation of data monopolies, and create a model that centres the governance framework around the protection of user privacy, based on the Puttaswamy judgement on the Fundamental Right to Privacy.

Along with several other organisations, we wrote a letter to the Union Minister for Agriculture, in which we asked for further consultations with all stakeholders, highlighted the need for statutory backing, and demanded greater transparency with regards to the financial details of the project.\nBackground On the 14th of April, 2021, the Press Information Bureau put a press release stating the Ministry of Agriculture had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microsoft for a pilot project in 100 villages. Under this MoU, Microsoft has been roped in to\n \u0026ldquo;to develop farmer interface for smart and well-organized agriculture, including post-harvest management and distribution\u0026rdquo;.\n The press release also stated that the government is preparing a farmer database by linking the land records of farmers across the country that would integrate data from PM Kisan, Soil Health Cards, and the Pradhan Mantri Crop Insurance Scheme as well as other data. Geo-tagging of agricultural assets shall also take place.\nSubsequent media reports have thrown further light upon on the project: the Union Minister for Agriculture, Narendra Singh Tomar, said that Microsoft would be helping farmers with\n \u0026ldquo;post harvest management solutions through building a collaborative platform and capturing agriculture datasets such as crop yields, weather data, market demand and prices\u0026rdquo;.\n The media reports have quoted senior officials in the Agriculture ministry as saying that Microsoft and its local partner CropData will be \u0026ldquo;leveraging\u0026rdquo; (using) a master database of farmers that will be shared with them by the government. This database would contain the data of 50 million farmers along with their land records.\nThe Agristack This pilot sounds very similar to the \u0026ldquo;Agristack\u0026rdquo;, which is the collection of technologies and digital databases, proposed by the Central Government focusing on India’s farmers and the agricultural sector. The Government confirmed the existence of the Agristack in an answer to a Lok Sabha question on 9th March, 2021. In the answer, the Ministry stated that a task force has been constituted to develop the IndEA (India Enterprise Architecture) Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture, on the basis of which a Unified Farmers Service Platform will be prepared. In other words, the Agristack is coming.\nWe have written about the Agristack before: last year in December, we worked with several volunteers and created a brief for analysis to serve as a primer on the Agristack. In the primer, we explained how the Agristack would function, provided some historical and legislative context, and looked at some of the issues with the project. These issues include:\n A lack of consultation with farmer organisations Increased algorithmic decision-making without accountability Concerns about the privacy of farmers' data  Given the existence of such significant concerns, the Agristack would have an extremely deleterious impact on farmers as:\n Their data may be exploited by private companies for purposes such as predatory lending or land grabs. Aadhaar and mandatory authentication-based exclusion from welfare measures and agricultures services Reduced agency on the part of the farmers with potential impacts on legal rights through databasing and surveillance  Thus we had recommended that comprehensive consultations with farmers groups be carried to generate feedback for the implementation of such technologies. We had spoken about the need for academics, technologists, civil society, and digital rights organisations to engage with, and study the Agristack programme, so as to understand the genuine problems faced by farmers. Lastly, we had called for an examination of the relationship between personal data and digital policies such as the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture and highlighted the need for a rights-centered data protection regime to undergird such policies.\nJoint Letter to the Agriculture Minister Along with organisations such as the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) - Kisan Swaraj, we have collaborated and co-signed onto a joint letter that has been sent to the Union Minister for Agriculture. We have also filed an RTI regarding various aspects of the pilot project and the MoU.\nThe joint letter co-signed by close to 55 organisations, collectives, and groups is reproduced below; the original can be found here.\n To,\n  Shri Narendra Singh Tomar,\n  Hon’ble Minister of Agriculture \u0026amp; Farmers’ Welfare,\n  Government of India.\n  Cc:\n  Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad, Union Minister of Law and Justice, Electronics and Information Technology\n  Dr. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairperson, NITI Aayog\n  Shri Sanjay Agarwal, Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture \u0026amp; Farmers Welfare\n  Shri Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology\n  Shri Anant Maheshwari, President of Microsoft India\n  Shri Sachin Suri, Managing Director of CropData Technology Pvt. Ltd.\n    Subject: Direction and Partnerships of the digital push by the Ministry of Agriculture\n  Dear Sir,\n  The Union Ministry of Agriculture and Microsoft India have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 13th April, 2021. As per news reports, “Microsoft through its local partner CropData will leverage master database of farmers to address challenges of individual or group of farmers. “The government has a verified database of more than 50 million farmers along with their land records,” a senior agriculture ministry official said.” Another report states, “the creation of Agri-Funds based on the National Farmers Database. The government is preparing a farmer database by linking the land records of farmers across the country. The data related to PM Kisan, Soil Health Card and Pradhan Mantri Crop Insurance Scheme, available with the government, have been integrated and the process of inclusion of other data is going on.”\n  These developments seem to allude to the AgriStack and seem to be taking place in a policy vacuum with respect to the data privacy of farmers and other related issues. At a time when “data has become the new oil” and the industry is looking at it as the next source of profits, there is a need to ensure the interest of farmers. It will not be surprising that corporations will approach this as one more profit-making possibility, as a market for so-called ‘solutions’ which lead to sale of unsustainable agri-inputs combined with greater loans and indebtedness of farmers for this through fintech, as well as the increased threat of dispossession by private corporations. All this is apart from the widely documented exclusion and other issues related to the central role that Aadhaar plays in this ecosystem.\n  Ultimately, any proposal which seeks to tackle the issues that plague Indian agriculture must address the fundamental causes of these issues - something the existing implementation of the Agristack fails to do. Indeed, the current model relies on ‘tech-solutionism’, in which it emphasises using technology to solve structural issues. Such an approach may fail to solve structural issues and instead gives rise to new problems, as has been witnessed in Indian agriculture in the past. In this case, these problems would include:\n   Usurious lending practices.    Further exploitation of farmers by procurers, including because of reduced local traders and competitors reducing the chances of getting a better price.    Reduced agency on the part of farmers.    Reduced transparency on the part of the government through algorithm-based decision-making. This includes the strong possibility of the database leveraging process using AI techniques that has the danger, either inadvertently or intentionally, of control systems becoming autonomous and even misaligned intelligence directing goals that are not set to our purpose. Lack of an AI policy and a legal security net in India, enhances such a danger.    In India, we find that real cultivators and farmers are still not part of data systems and they are not recognised as Farmers. Digitisation of land records created new problems which have not been addressed so far.    The government’s official press release states that “[t]ransparency at the central government level is benefiting the farmers”. In keeping with this government’s espousal of the idea of transparency, and in order to truly benefit farmers without compromising on their autonomy and agency and clear the air on the government’s vision for greater digitisation in agriculture we request the following immediately:\n   The Ministry should hold consultations with all stakeholders, especially farmers’ organisations, on the direction of its digital push as well as the basis of partnerships, and put out a policy document in this regard after giving due consideration to feedback from farmers and farmer organisations. As agriculture is a state subject, the central government should consult the state governments also.    All initiatives that the government has begun with private entities to integrate and / or share multiple databases with private/personal information about individual farmers or their farms be put on hold till (i) the policy framework mentioned in the earlier point is finalised by the ministry and (ii) a data protection law is passed by the Parliament. This agreement and any other such agreements with any IT organisations must be backed by adequate legal systems in India. Existing laws must be reviewed considering the advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data and new laws need to be enacted accordingly.    The MoU signed between the Ministry of Agriculture and Microsoft India on 13th April, 2021 should be put in the public domain on the website of the ministry, apart from being put on hold as per Point 2 above. Further, any financial commitments or implications must also be put on hold and be disclosed.

Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from Government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights. We also highlight how our demands for transparency have been affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information (RTI) Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from, the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of April, we have up till now filed 7 RTI requests electronically with authorities at the Central level, concerning the various issues on which we engage with the Government.\nNote: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month\u0026rsquo;s report may be included in the present report.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 6 RTI requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:\n The Unique Identification Authority of India on their plans for a ‘touchless’ vaccination process, with Aadhaar-based facial recognition. The National Health Authority on their plans for a ‘touchless’ vaccination process, with Aadhaar-based facial recognition. The Airports Authority of India on their use of facial recognition technology at the Varanasi Airport. The Airports Authority of India on their use of facial recognition technology at the Vijayawada Airport. The Airports Authority of India on their use of facial recognition technology at the Pune Airport.  Additionally we also filed requests with:\n The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation \u0026amp; Farmers Welfare on the MoU with Microsoft for a pilot project in 100 villages of 6 states.  Free Speech and Censorship Our other main focus is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the last month, we have filed 1 RTI request to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology on a news report titled, “Twitter removes over 50 posts on govt. orders; majority related to COVID-19,\u0026quot; published in The Hindu dated April 25, 2021.  Transparency has taken a hit during the lockdown Over the last month, our efforts at demanding transparency have de-accelerated considerably. This is due to our inability to safely file RTI requests physically. Only the Central Government and certain State Governments have a dedicated online portal for filing RTI requests. For most other State authorities across the country, RTI requests still have to be filed physically. The lack of an online RTI portal creates considerable hurdles to demanding transparency in situations like the current one wherein physical filing has become impossible due to the ongoing pandemic.\nImportant Documents  Digital Transparency: A Right to Information Report for March, 2021 dated April 6, 2021 (link) Response received from MeitY’s CPIO pursuant to the CIC hearing on March 25, 2021 dated April 13, 2021 (link) Without prejudice: The least the government can do is proactively publish judicial orders for website blocking dated April 21, 2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/digital-transparency-a-right-to-information-report-for-april-2021/","summary":"Since our last report in the month of March, IFF has filed 7 RTI requests.

Will the bill serve ordinary Indians, or the government and large corporations is a big issue dominating our minds. To clear this up we need the law, to have clear objectives that record what is a priority. People, or profit. Unfortunately the Preamble of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 engages in some hand waving and tries an awkward balancing exercise that is inconsistent with principles of data protection.\nBackground Over the course of the last few weeks, we had provided a series of explainers on various facets of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. In part 1, we gave an introduction to the Bill and provided some historical context to data protection in India; in part 2, we explained the key definitions and clauses of the Bill; in part 3, we briefly touched upon the various issues with the Bill; and in part 4, we looked at alternative paradigms of data protection legislation.\nIn this new series #DataProtectionTop10, we wish to discuss the concerns surrounding the Personal Data Protection BIll, 2019. Unlike part 3 of our #StartFromScratch series, which was more of a sneak peak, this series aims at pulling out important issues related to the Bill and dissecting each one in detail. As the issues with the Bill start right from its beginning, this post will delve into the concerns around the Preamble of the Bill.\nThe issue: Lack of clarity on the objectives Behind every law, there is a purpose. This purpose constitutes the objectives of a statute (a statute is basically an act of parliament). They are set out at the very beginning of a statute in its preamble. These ultimate objectives anchor the interpretation of the statute and hold together the various provisions in it. The preamble along with the objectives of a statute will tell you what the lawmakers are trying to achieve through that particular legislation.\nAt the end of the day, a strong data protection regime has to be clear on what it is trying to achieve. Determining the objective of a data protection legislation is no easy task, mainly due to the unique nature of the data and the interests of the State involved in the regulation of the data. Data has long since been seen as what belongs to you or what information you generate, and is now a valuable commodity in the market. The commodification of data in this highly technology driven world has presented two conflicting choices before policy makers: protection of information privacy of the citizens, and fostering the data economy of the country.\nThe founding document of the Personal Data Protection Bill; the Sri Krishna Committee report throws light on what the considerations should be in formulating a legal framework on data protection which would work as a template for the developing world. The report states that the protection of personal data holds the key to empowerment, progress, and innovation. It also notes that any such legal framework on data protection should be not only for India, but for Indians. Such a framework should also understand from the ground up the particular concerns and aspirations pertaining to personal data shared by Indians, their fears and hopes. However this draft bill and the report by the Sri Krishna Committee was also disappointing for it brought into priority issues of promotion of data side businesses along with data protection. A good way to think about this is to pose a question. Will legislation or law for, let’s say, protection of the environment (like the Air Act) also in its preamble mark an equal priority for the promotion of industries?\nThe Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017 Now that we have the second draft of the Bill, in the form of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, it is pertinent to analyse whether these were the considerations that influenced the drafters of the Bill, or if they were influenced by some other objectives. From the preamble of the Bill we can discern that the primary objective of the Bill is to create a collective culture which promotes a free and fair digital economy, progress and innovation, while respecting informational privacy. This essentially means that the PDP Bill aims to promote digital economy of India through data protection legislation. This leads us to the obvious question: how does protection of information privacy fit in this matrix?\nRather than prioritising the informational privacy of individuals over economic benefits of data, the PDP Bill 2019 places these two competing and contradicting goals on the same footing. The natural consequence that flows from this is that the informational privacy of Indians, which should have been the primary objective of the PDP Bill gets sidetracked. In addition to this, because of the ambiguity in the primary objective of the data protection law, the balancing of competing interests also gets messy.\nThe preamble also appears to have failed to mention the need for protecting the right to privacy of individuals from one of the powerful and biggest processors of personal data: the State. The right to privacy, being a fundamental right, is essentially a right that is available to us against the State. The State has a duty to not intrude into the personal lives of individuals, and to protect the privacy of individuals. Furthermore, in these times, where State sponsored mass surveillance runs rife, it is important to state in clear terms in the preamble of a data protection law that it is applicable to the State - the primary focus of the Bill should be on protecting the data and informational privacy of individuals from both the State as well as private actors.\nSolutions : Clearer objectives to secure your digital rights The problems with the objectives of the PDP Bill, 2019 become more glaring when we compare it with the GDPR, which sets the standard for comprehensive data protection laws, or the two private member Bills which we discussed in Part 4 of the #StartfromScratch series : the Data Privacy and Protection Bill, 2017 and The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019.\nThe objectives of GDPR are enshrined in the recitals. The recitals set the context and objectives of the GDPR, and supplements the articles. Recital 4 of the GDPR starts by stating that the processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The recitals acknowledge that individuals should have the control of their own personal data. The need for development of the digital economy is also addressed by the GDPR. The recitals note that a strong and coherent data protection framework is required, for this would foster the trust that is essential for the development of the digital economy.\nEconomic benefits of data and development of the data economy find no place in the objectives of the Data Privacy and Protection Bill, 2017 and The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019. These Bills place the protection of informational privacy of the individuals from private actors as well as the State at the heart of the data protection framework and based on these objectives devise an individual centric rights based data protection regime.\nFostering the digital economy is indeed a legitimate interest of the State, but it should not become a playground for the trade off of informational privacy for innovation and economic growth. In our comments submitted to the Sri Krishna Committee, we had highlighted this very fact; that a data protection law must place individuals at its centre, and their interest should be paramount, especially when weighed against state expectations or commercial interests.\nThe first out of the 7 privacy principles states that the protection of the right to privacy of the individuals promotes innovation in a sustainable way. This essentially means that right to privacy of the individuals should be the means to promote innovation. The efficient use of data and adherence to the principles of data protection will help businesses in gaining and retaining the trust of customers, and loyal customers equals the good growth of businesses.\nThe other related concerns regarding innovation etc. can be addressed through suitable compliant norms, once a data protection law and its modalities are in place. Thus, the objective of the Personal Data Protection Bill must be restated in unambiguous terms, affirming that the overriding objective of the Bill is the protection of data and informational privacy of the individuals from both private as well as State actors. Doing so would ensure that data protection regimes in India remain focused on the user and provide us, the citizens of India, with control over our own data!\nThis is the last blogpost in our series of explainers on the Data Protection Bill; read part 1 here, part 2 here, and part 3 here.

In this post, we will be exploring how use of facial recognition technology (FRT) has been regulated in the United States of America post 2020. We will specifically take a look at how political \u0026amp; social movements have affected these attempts at regulating the technology. This is the first of a three part series which will take a look at how various jurisdictions around the world are responding to this technology.\nFRT regulation in USA The USA is a federal republic and thus, its citizens are subjected to regulations at the local, state and federal levels. The table below illustrates the different regulations in place currently at the city and state level.

In the next section we will take a look at the various factors that have played a role in the regulation of this highly intrusive technology.\nHighlights: Factors affecting the regulation of FRT in USA A. Foundational analysis by a cross sections of experts \u0026amp; activists\nThe usage of FRT started receiving criticism from privacy and civil liberties organizations once it was determined that the use of this technology would lead to exclusionary and discriminatory outcomes. In 2016, the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology released a report titled, “The Perpetual Line-up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition In America” which said that, among other issues, use of FRT by the police would disproportionately affect and be least accurate for African Americans.\nIn 2018, researchers Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru in their paper titled, “Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification” found that facial recognition systems had higher error rates while identifying women and people of color, with the error rate being the highest while identifying women of color. (Visit the project website here)\nOn July 26, 2018, the ACLU published the results from a test which found that Amazon’s facial recognition software “Rekognition” incorrectly matched 28 members of the US Congress with people who had been arrested for committing a crime. Of those members who were incorrectly matched, 40% were people of color which is a disproportionate number since people of color make up only 20% of the US Congress.\nOn June 3, 2019, the ACLU led over 60 privacy, civil liberties, civil rights, and investor and faith groups in urging the US Congress to put in place a federal moratorium on FRT for law enforcement and immigration enforcement purposes until they fully debate what, if any, uses should be permitted. The coalition included, among others, organisations such as Fight for the Future, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Algorithmic Justice League and the Georgetown Center for Privacy and Technology.\nAs a result of these actions as well as other research conducted independently, many cities across the USA started thinking about how to regulate FRT, specifically police use of FRT, leading to multiple bans across the country in pre-2020.\nB. The Black Lives Matter Movement\nThe Black Lives Matter Movement, which started in 2013, is a political and social movement which highlights racial inequities and demands racial justice specifically with regard to the disproportionate violence faced by African Americans at the hands of the police in the USA. The movement returned to global spotlight again on May 26, 2020 after protests broke out all over the USA against the murder of an African American man (George Floyd) at the hands of a White police officer.\nIt was during these protests that multiple reports of the use of FRT by the police against protesters started emerging. There was a massive public outcry with regard to how the excessive high-tech surveillance of African American activists and reporters was driving police brutality. The protests led to heightened scrutiny into how this invasive surveillance technology is used not only to over-police and racially profile minorities but also to strip aways basic rights such as the freedom of speech and the right to protest. In response to this, companies such as IBM, Amazon and Microsoft announced that until federal laws are put in place, they will not be selling FRT to the police.\nC. January 6, 2021 Capitol Riot\nThe positive changes brought about by the Black Lives Matter movement were however brought to naught in the aftermath of the riots which took place at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Use of FRT by police and security agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was one of the foremost ways in which rioters who stormed the Capitol were being identified. This posed a complexity for regulation and is an ongoing process of policy debate as a federal level ban is considered.\nOngoing development of FRT regulation in USA Demands for a federal legislation on FRT have been increasing over the past two years. Multiple bills on FRT such as 2019’s Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act, 2020’s Ethical Use Of Facial Recognition Act, and Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Act of 2020, were introduced but never moved forward. The George Floyd Justice In Policing Act and Advancing Facial Recognition Act failed to be adopted.\nIn February, 2021, civil rights groups again wrote to the Government calling for a federal ban on the use of this technology. In April, 2021, US Sens. Ron Wyden and Rand Paul introduced a bipartisan bill titled the “Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act” which would ban the U.S. government and law enforcement agencies from buying user data without a warrant. The Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. In Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 (1967), the United States Supreme Court established that the Fourth Amendment protects legitimate or reasonable expectations of privacy where:\n a person has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy, and the expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as “reasonable.”  The Bill is aimed specifically at the notorious Clearview AI which is infamous for illegally pulling images from social media and other websites such as Facebook, Google and Twitter for its technology.\nWe hope this analysis helps guide researchers, advocates and groups in India on the path forward for crafting a legal framework for FRT regulation in India that may include banning its deployment for specific purposes.\nFRT regulation around the world Under IFF’s Project Panoptic, we have called for a ban on government entities, police and other security/intelligence agencies using FRT. In this series, we will be taking a look at how our stance measures up against developments on FRT regulations around the world.

Today, we explore why the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules are unconstitutional in how they exceed the limits of the parent Act, violate the Puttaswamy judgement and proportionality test, and are vague and non-voluntary. We have written to the Chairpersons of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Committees on Subordinate Legislation petitioning them to take up the Rules for review, in the hope that others will take up the mantle and write to the committee as well.\nThe Aadhaar Good Governance Rules The **** Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 **** (“Aadhaar Act”) gives the UIDAI unfettered discretion to set the policy on issues crucial to the scope, security and ambit of Aadhaar and its uses. This broad power warrants close parliamentary scrutiny over each regulation that the UIDAI adopts, including the rules in question, which were framed by the Central Government in consultation with UIDAI.\nUnder sub – section (1) of section 53 and clause (aa) of sub-section (2) of section 53 of the Aadhaar Act, the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020 were notified on 5th August, 2020t, 2016 and laid on the table of the Lok Sabha on 3rd January, 2021. Essentially, the Rules state that the Central government may allow “requesting entities” to engage in Aadhaar Based Authentication in the interest of good governance, preventing the leakage of public funds, or promoting ease of living and enabling better access to services for residents. Aadhaar authentication can be proposed for the following purposes under Rule 3(1):\n usage of digital platforms to ensure good governance; prevention of dissipation of social welfare benefits; enablement of innovation and the spread of knowledge.  As per the consolidated response to certain RTIs filed by us, as of 1st April, 2021, 53 proposals from Ministries or Departments of the Central government or State governments for permission to use Aadhaar authentication under these Rules. Of these 53 proposals, 32 have been referred to the Unique Identification Authority of India under Rule 5 of the Rules, out of which 22 proposals have been accepted and 10 proposals are under examination.\nWhat this indicates is that wide-spread Aadhaar based authentication is no longer a proposal and is now a reality. For example, on March 3, 2020, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways issued a notification allowing for the voluntary use of the Aadhaar number which can be used “by any individual, desirous of availing various contactless services. Alternatively, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued a notification by which it proposes to use Aadhaar authentication to generate a unique Health identifier.\nThe Aadhaar project has faced several criticisms since its inception; such criticisms have only heightened after its implementation, with a diverse set of actors from the Supreme Court to CAG of India to various civil society bodies questioning the use of Aadhaar based authentication. Indeed, the Economic Survey 2016-17 (para 9.67) has acknowledged the existence of severe exclusion errors due to authentication failure, with failure rates ranging from 5% in Gujarat to 37% in Rajasthan and 49% in Jharkhand! This is before considering the wide range of data security issues and privacy issues that are associated with Aadhaar, especially in the absence of an adequate data protection law. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought these concerns to the fore, with reports of an Aadhaar-based facial recognition system being used in the vaccine rollout and Aadhaar being mandatory for admission into COVID-19 wards in hospitals.\nThus, it is now critical that greater Parliamentary scrutiny into the Rules takes place.\nThe unconstitutional nature of the Rules Upon analysis, several major issues with the Rules have emerged:\n **The Rules travel outside the parent legislation and exceed the limits of the Aadhaar Act: ** It is settled jurisprudence that the rules framed under an Act cannot travel beyond the boundaries of the Act. According to the preamble, and Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, the Aadhaar number can be mandated as proof of authentication of identities for the receipt of certain subsidies, benefits and services, which have been funded by the Consolidated Fund of India (or the Consolidated fund of states). Thus, the objectives provided under Clause 3(1) of the Rules, must fall within these boundaries. But due to the expansive wording of these purposes, any government project could come under the ambit of these objectives, some of which will go beyond the scope of the Aadhaar Act. It must also be recalled that the Aadhaar Act was certified as a money bill, on the grounds that it was linked to welfare goods and services which were funded by the Consolidated Fund of India through Section 7. The Rules expand the ambit and scope of the Act, which would sever the connection to the Act as a Money Bill. The Rules violate the Supreme Court’s Aadhaar Judgement: In Justice (Retd.) KS Puttaswamy v Union of India , a majority bench of the Supreme Court found the Aadhaar Act constitutional, but only after drawing strict lines in the sand for how Aadhaar could be used. The Court held that the government was permitted to use Aadhaar authentication for a limited set of purposes and struck down Section 57, which permitted private parties to use Aadhaar authentication, as there was a possibility of it being commercially exploited by private entities. Clause 4 of the Rules mentions that ‘requesting entities’ could be the Ministry, Department of the Government of India or any State Government that wants to use Aadhaar for the purposes specified in the Rules. In this regard, the question to be asked is what if the ‘requesting entity’ is applying for the purpose of a public-private partnership project? In this case, it would be impossible for the private entity to not get access to the Aadhaar numbers of individuals. Additionally, the Aadhaar Amendment Act, 2019, which permits private parties access to Aadhaar numbers is pending challenge in the Supreme Court, for violating the Puttaswamy judgement. The Rules are only voluntary in name: Clause 3(2) of the Rules states that the process of authentication for the purposes set out in the rules is ‘voluntary’. However, the experience with Aadhaar authentication and recent instances like the roll-out of the Covid vaccination have shown that the Government has pushed Aadhaar so that it becomes the ‘preferred’ mode of verification and authentication. This could eventually lead it to becoming mandatory for government services, in direct violation of the Supreme Court judgement. Thus, even though it is voluntary on paper, it de-facto becomes mandatory in usage. There is also no assurance in the rules about the status of those who choose not to provide their Aadhaar numbers for authentication purposes. This can also take the form of financial compulsions. For example, at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the premier government hospital, a patient can get the registration charges of Rs. 100 waived off if they provide their Aadhaar ID to authenticate their identity. Such a policy significantly privileges the usage of Aadhaar and thus effectively amounts to financial coercion towards the adoption of the Health ID. For the Good Governance rules, some Ministries have stated that Aadhaar authentication is “voluntary,” as it is only required if a citizen wants to access a public service online. For example, the Ministry of Road Transport has applied for permission under the Good Governance Rules to use Aadhaar authentication for online applications for licenses/ learners’ licenses, and other related services. Through this method, Aadhaar becomes de-facto mandatory to access public services online, thus creating a barrier to the right to the internet and to public services. Additionally, technology failures plague the Aadhaar authentication system, and have already led to serious issues of exclusion from welfare benefits, which are likely to be aggravated.The linkage of Aadhaar to welfare services has caused large numbers of people to be excluded from their welfare benefits, which has caused immeasurable hardship. Increasing the use cases for Aadhaar authentication would only exacerbate this problem, and increases the risk of infringement of the right to privacy. The CEO of UIDAI had noted that in 2018 authentication failure for government services was as high as 12%. A recent J-PAL study in Jharkhand also found that Aadhaar based verification “either did not reduce errors of inclusion or leakage or did so at the cost of increased exclusion error”, with an error of between 22% and 34% of reduced disbursals. Reports of starvation deaths due to a lack of Aadhaar linkage or biometric failure have also been repeatedly highlighted. The Rules are unconstitutionally vague: The Rules include vague terms like ‘good governance’, ‘social welfare benefits’, ‘innovation’, ‘spread of knowledge’, and ‘satisfied;/ These terms are not defined either in the Rules or Aadhaar Act or even the Information Technology Act, 2000, and could possibly include every government and administrative function. The rules lack guidelines which would help the administrative authorities decide the various circumstances under which the rules would become operative, or the limits to which its power could be extended. The wide discretionary power of the Rules amounts to excessive delegation, which would be illegal. The Rules violate the proportionality test: The rules also fail to fulfil the test of proportionality, confirmed by the Puttaswamy judgement. In order for the Rules to be accepted, the following conditions must be met: 1) Legality or the existence of a law , 2) Need, defined in terms of a legitimate state aim, and 3) Proportionality which ensures a rational nexus between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them. The objectives of the Rules, however, are vague, and do not define the particular aim that the State intends to achieve through the Rules. Hence, they fail to fulfill the second and third conditions of the proportionality test.  Letters to the Committees The presence of such significant issues further increases the need for Parliamentary oversight. However, a curtailed Budget session has meant that the Rules have not been debated on the floor of the house. Thus, we have written to the Chairpersons of the both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Committees on Subordinate Legislation which scrutinise subordinate legislation such as rules, regulations, and bye-laws that emerge from Acts (for example, in the past, the Lok Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation has provided its recommendations on the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines), 2011). Through our letter, we have petitioned the Committees to take up the Rules for review and test them on the grounds of constitutional principles. We hope that others will take up the mantle and write to the committee as well.\nDocuments  Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020 (link) IFF’s Letter to the Chairperson of the Lok Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation regarding a petition to review the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance Rules, 2020(link) IFF’s Letter to the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation regarding a petition to review the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance Rules, 2020 (link)  This endeavour was the result of collaborative work with other organisations who assisted in drafting the petition and engaging in advocacy.

We began with an explanation of all the definitions and jargon, and then showed how the Bill:\n provides users with certain Rights; lays down a consent mechanism for the processing of personal data; imposes on obligations on data collectors and processors lays down transparency and accountability measures to be followed provides the government with certain exemptions  We also provided an update on the Bill: the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill will now be releasing its report in the first week of the monsoon session.\nThen last week, in part 3, we highlighted the key concerns with the Bill that we feel deserved the most attention. Broadly, we covered the following issues: the dilution of user’s rights, non-consensual processing of data, definitional ambiguities, the removal of anonymity on social media, the threat of increased surveillance, the lack of independence of the Data Protection Authority, and governmental access to non-personal data.\nThis post will be the last in our #StartfromScratch series, and we plan to use this to provide examples of what other potential data protection frameworks might look like. Now, the Puttaswamy judgment of the Supreme Court, which enshrined the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, noted that a data protection bill signals a positive obligation of the Government of India towards fulfilling the autonomy and dignity of the people by securing informational privacy. Hence, any data protection legislation needs to be centred around our fundamental rights. The bill must cement the power of individuals and communities that constitute individuals over governments and corporations.\nFor instance, the Government of India is under a clear obligation to provide essential services. However, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is ambiguous about whether services may be denied due to a lack of consent for the processing of personal data. Another example is the use of surveillance technology.\nToday, such technologies are no longer about the surveillance of the high and the mighty - they are now used for a more everyday surveillance in which the aam aadmi is constantly surveilled in public spaces and while using public infrastructure. Facial surveillance even occurs through masks in metropolitan areas. Such technologies are not adequately regulated under the Personal Data Protection Bill, under which there are exemptions for large categories of surveillance which do not have any oversight mechanisms of judicial review, a hallmark of a democratic country. Furthermore, existing models of data protection, as well as a lot of the conversation that occurs around the bill, focus more on the growth of the digital economy, rather than the protection of an individual’s privacy. We believe that any rights respecting legislation should not drive a bargain between the market and fundamental rights.\nWith this in mind, we will now explain the 7 privacy principles of the India Privacy Code, 2018, put forth and discussed by lawyers involved in the Puttaswamy case and by public law experts. We believe that these principles must form the bedrock of any forthcoming data protection legislation.\nThe 7 Privacy Principles of #SaveOurPrivacy These Principles were created through a collaborative and iterative process by a diverse group of civil society organisations, lawyers involved in cases and submissions related to digital rights, and digital law experts. They draw from a variety of sources, including the Privacy (Protection) Bill, 2013, the report of the Justice A.P. Shah Committee of Experts, and submissions by multiple lawyers to the Justice Srikrishna Committee of Experts, as well as various Supreme Court judgements such as the Puttaswamy judgement. Best practices from international frameworks such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation were also taken into account:\n Individual rights are at the center of privacy and data protection: The individual and their rights are primary. The promotion of an individual’s rights promotes innovation in a sustainable way. A data protection law must be based on privacy principles: User rights as identified by the report of the Justice A.P. Shah Committee of Experts are essential to a data protection law. Additionally, a data protection law should develop with advances in technology and global best practices. Exceptions to the law should be: (a) worded clearly; (b) limited in purpose, necessary and proportionate to the aim; and (c) accompanied by sufficient procedural safeguards. ****A strong privacy authority must be created to enforce the privacy principles: **** We need a strong and independent body to ensure that the data protection rights are put into practice and enforced. It should be provided wide powers of investigation, adjudication, rule-making and enforcement. The authority should adopt an approach that builds accountability for the rights of users by having powers to impose penalties that are proportionate to the harm and build deterrence, and should serve as a forum for the redressal of the general public’s grievances. The government should respect user privacy: We support the use of digital technologies for public benefit. However, they should not be privileged over fundamental rights. Individuals cannot be forced to trade away their data and citizenship at the altar of being permitted to use government services and access legal entitlements on welfare. To make sure this happens the privacy authority must have overriding power and superintendence over all legal entities, including the government, in matters of data protection and privacy. A complete privacy code comes with surveillance reform: Any data protection law has to limit mass surveillance as it contravenes the principles of necessity, proportionality and purpose limitation. Even when individual interception and surveillance is carried out this should be severely limited in substance and practice through procedural safeguards. Furthermore, the privacy authority must be allowed oversight over surveillance activities, while, to ensure accountability, all such orders need to be communicated to the person who was surveilled. The right to information needs to be strengthened and protected: Individual rights are well served by the Right to Information Act which brings accountability to the functioning of government and public authorities. Hence, privacy protections which already exist under the Right to Information Act and are made subject to public interest, need to be preserved. Information Commissioners should be exempted from interference or control from external authorities. International protections and harmonisation to protect the open internet must be incorporated: Data protection legislations must have extraterritorial effect and apply to web services and platforms which are accessible in India and which gather personal data of Indians. At the same time, care and caution should be taken to preserve the global character of the open internet which is beneficial to Indians as they can access information, knowledge and services from all over the world.  We will now look at two legislations that we believe further the process started by the privacy principles.\nThe Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017 The Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017 is a variant of the Indian Privacy Code, 2017 was introduced in the Lok Sabha as a private member Bill by Sashi Tharoor MP. The Bill was submitted to the Parliament before the Puttaswamy judgement and the constitution of the Sri Krishna Committee. The Bill is thus inspired by international best practices and the report of the Justice A.P. Shah Committee of Experts.\nThe Bill seeks to establish an effective and comprehensive data protection regime in the country to protect the right to privacy of individuals in a data driven world, and shuns the ‘goods and services’ driven perspective on data. At the outset, the Bill sets down the guiding principles by enumerating the core data protection principles that are embedded in the Bill and those that govern the Bill. Individuals are made the owners of and put in control of their personal data. The Bill acknowledges that the Government is one of the biggest collectors of personal data and makes it a point to bring the State under its purview to plug misuse by the State. The main regulatory body envisaged is an independent privacy commission. The Bill has various provisions to secure the independence and accountability of its regulatory body and to prevent it from being reduced to a paper tiger. Given that the Bill was drafted before the Puttaswamy judgement, it stands out for being the first statute to explicitly declare that right to privacy is a fundamental right, which is essential to the maintenance of a democratic society.\nUser consent forms the bedrock for data processing under this Bill. The collection and processing of personal data has to be done with the consent of data subjects. In the event of a data breach, notifications must be sent not just to the Privacy Commissioner, but also to the data subjects affected. Certain types of data such as medical records, financial data, biometrics, sexual preference and practices, political affiliation, etc. have been classified as sensitive personal data and are afforded even more protection by requiring explicit consent for the collection and processing of such data.\nThe Bill limits the grounds for the non-consensual processing of data to two cases: a) the use of personal data for personal or family use and b) surveillance by a resident of their own residential property. The limitations on the collection, processing, and storage of personal data are carefully drafted keeping in mind the interest of the data subjects. Indeed, a remarkable feature of the Bill is its focus on the collection of personal data by intelligence agencies, surveillance, and interception of communications. The Bill devotes Chapters IV and V to interception and surveillance respectively. The Bill appears to be mindful of the perils of mass surveillance and bans it outright. Though surveillance at the level of the individual may be allowed, certain safeguards have been placed to ensure that such exemptions do not become a tool to crush dissent. For example, an order of the Chief Privacy Officer is required for carrying out surveillance and interception. Furthemore, any person being surveilled must be informed about such surveillance and the duration thereof.\nThe Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 Following the lapse of the Data Privacy and Protection Bill, 2017, another private member Bill; The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 was introduced in the Parliament by Dr. Ravikumar M.P. in 2019. It is another, more updated and robust variant of the is a variant of the Indian Privacy Code, 2017. This Bill was a big step along the path to securing the right to privacy of individuals. This Bill is built around the seven privacy principles under the updated Indian Privacy Code, 2018.\nThe Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019, seeks to ensure the protection of informational privacy of individuals through a rights-based individual-centric data protection regime. Like the Data (Privacy and Protection Bill) 2017, this Bill also declares at its outset that every person has a natural right to privacy. The guiding principles of the Bill make it mandatory that personal data be processed fairly and lawfully. These principles also state that any invasion of privacy shall be evaluated based on the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality, and thus enshrines the privacy test laid down in the Puttaswamy judgement. The collection of personal data under the Bill is envisaged through a meaningful, revocable, and accountable notice and consent framework.\nThe provisions of the Bill that handle consent are thorough. An important provision on consent under the Bill is that the data controller cannot deny any service to any person for the reason that consent for sharing personal data for identification purposes has not been obtained. Moreover, the data subjects can claim compensation if essential services are denied to them on this ground. This provision has contemporary relevance where Aadhar has become the prerequisite for availing of essential services.\nThe Bill confers certain rights to the individuals, such as the right to access personal data, the right to correct their personal data, the right to destruction and erasure of personal data, right to object etc. Among these rights, most remarkable is the right to seek exemption from automated decision making. Individuals can seek exemption from decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where such automated decisions cause demonstrable harm or injury.Similar to the 2017 Bill, the grounds for exemption under this Bill are limited as well. Interception and Surveillance are dealt with in detail separately under Chapter IV of the Bill. The safeguards on surveillance and interception under this Bill are almost similar to that in the The Data (Privacy and Protection) Bill, 2017. However, the Bill provides for the setting up of a Surveillance and Interception Review Division, which review, renew, or take any other action with respect to orders for the interception of communications and surveillance.\nThis is the last blogpost in our series of explainers on the Data Protection Bill; read part 1 here, part 2 here, and part 3 here.

It is a cyber security newsletter with a round up of the latest developments in the domain of digital security. The goal of this monthly newsletter is to open a conversation about the digital security crisis India has been undergoing for a few years now and understand why this is an important issue for you to actively start engaging with. Every month I will try to sum up the key cybersec updates you should know about on a national and international scale. If there is something you think I should cover next month, drop me a line at: shivani@internetfreedom.in. I’m listening!\nFor the first edition of this newsletter, I will cover something that has been in the news for a while now, i.e. the most recent data breaches that have accessed the personal data of millions of Indian users and what that means for us.\nBut first, what do I mean by a digital security crisis/es? Consider the following:\n On February 3, 2021, multiple reports suggested that the data of 2.5 Million Airtel users was compromised in a breach. The leaked data included Airtel customers’ names, phone numbers, DOBs, addresses and Aadhar numbers. Airtel denied that any such breach had occurred and alleged that the data didn’t belong to Airtel customers. However, independent researchers were able to confirm that the leaked data indeed belonged to Airtel subscribers. Their users were not informed of this breach. On February 26, 2021 an Indian internet security researcher by the name of Rajshekhar Rajaharia put out a tweet that a massive data breach had put the data of 11 Crore Indian users on sale on the darkweb, allegedly from a company’s server in India. According to the tweet, the KYC details of users were leaked during the breach which included information about their PAN, Aadhar, etc. A little over a month later, on March 29, 2021 news broke that this was the data of Mobikwik’s users. Mobikwik denied any wrongdoing and blamed their users instead. Here’s a useful read if you want to learn about this breach in detail. Mobikwik’s users were also not informed of this breach. In early 2020, a vulnerability that enabled seeing the phone number linked to every Facebook account was exploited, creating a database containing the information of 533m users across countries. On April 3, 2021 it was reported that the data was leaked for free to the world. Security researchers revealed that the personal data of 50+ crore Facebook users was breached, including over 60 Lakh Indian Facebook users. The leaked data includes information of users such as phone numbers, Facebook ID, location, past locations, birthdate, email address and relationship status. Facebook claimed that the data was from 2019 and they had fixed the issue. Their story has a lot of holes but the important thing to note is that regardless of when the breach occurred, Facebook did not inform its users about it.  This isn’t the first time companies have denied a data breach. In fact, many have gone to great lengths to cover up such security incidents. Moreover, these are only a few recent, handpicked instances. Ponemon’s Cost Of A Data Breach Report 2020 (commissioned by IBM) studied breaches in 17 countries (including India). They found a lot of things but here are some of their key findings that might be of interest to you:\n  Data from Ponemon’s Cost Of A Data Breach Report 2020\nAccording to the bar chart above, Customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) was the type of most often lost or stolen in breaches. This is exactly the kind of data that was leaked in the aforementioned Mobikwik and Airtel breaches. Whereas, these instances highlight a pattern of impunity with which these companies function, it is also just the tip of the iceberg. Prioritising digital security must become a part of companies and organizations’ formal policies. In a report by Accenture in 2019, (again, by Ponemon and commissioned by Accenture) that studied the Cost of Cybercrime put this across really well:\nIncreases in phishing, ransomware and malicious insider attacks mean that greater emphasis needs to be on nurturing a security-first culture. Accountability is key. Training and education are essential to reinforce safe behaviours, both for people within the organization and across the entire business ecosystem.\nSo, is there nothing we can do? Yes there is! There’s plenty we can do on our own personal level that will really help amp up your digital security and safeguard you from quite a few, if not all, cybersecurity threats! The goal of today’s post is quite simply to disseminate information and hopefully provide you with some helpful advice on how you can regain control if your PII has been leaked in a breach.\n Step 1: Firstly, find out if you’re amongst the millions of people who’ve had their email or phone information stolen at some point, in some data breach. If the answer is yes, and it will be for 90% of people, please change your passwords everywhere. A much better option here would be to opt for a passphrase instead of a password since they can be much harder to crack. Step 2: If you use the same password or passphrase everywhere, change them everywhere and set a completely different one for each service (avoid reusing your passwords!). This is helpful because even if your password has been compromised, it still can’t be used by anyone to gain access to your accounts if you’ve already changed your password everywhere. And a really easy way to manage your passwords for different services without having to remember them is to use a password manager. The best passwords are the ones you don’t remember! Step 3: Lastly, please set complex passwords and passphrases. You can’t fight big tech and other malicious actors if your password is 12345678. There’s a lot more you can do and we’ll cover a few digisec dos and don\u0026rsquo;ts as a part of each of these blog posts / newsletters.  Amping up your everyday digital hygiene is at the core of protecting your data. Oftentimes, these concepts are accessible only by people who are comfortable using and interacting with technology in their daily lives. In order to bridge that gap, we’ve also started making digital security videos in Hindi, in an attempt to make these concepts reach a more diverse audience. If you have any ideas on how we can do a better job at reaching more people, please reach out to us. We aim to listen, learn and grow!

This updates previous forms of data but given actual URLs were not provided it is deficient. In total, 94 blocking orders were issued by the DoT during 2020 \u0026amp; 2021 to block or disable access to 3725 websites/URLs. Given that making such requests and getting information is a time consuming process to further transparency we wrote to Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) to, at the least, consider proactive publication of judicial orders and maintaining a public list of websites/URLs blocked under it.\nWhat we found On February 8, 2021, we filed a RTI request with MTNL asking them to provide us with information pertaining to websites, URLs or applications blocked pursuant to any order/decree/judgment passed by a competent court during 2020 and 2021.\n   RTI request filed with MTNL on website blocking dated February 8, 2021  Our request was further transferred from MTNL to DoT, from DoT to Director General (Telecom) HQ and finally from Director General (Telecom) HQ back to DoT.\nIn response to the transferred request bearing reference no. DOTEL/R/T/21/00132, the DoT provided a reply dated March 4, 2021. In their response, the DoT states that, \u0026ldquo;94 blocking orders issued by DoT during 2020 \u0026amp; 2021 pursuant to orders of different Hon\u0026rsquo;ble courts. 3725 website/URL blocked or access disabled pursuant to these orders.\u0026rdquo; They also attached an annexure which contained the list of cases pursuant to which DoT issued these orders.\n   Response received from DoT on website blocking dated March 4, 2021  We also filed a First Appeal against this response, asking the First Appellate authority to direct the CPIO to share with us the specific court orders pursuant to which the blocking orders were issued.\nWebsite blocking in India In India, there are two sources of website blocking:\n Executive: A website can be blocked pursuant to directions of the Central Government under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. This is usually done by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and DoT. However, the Central Government cannot directly block websites for merely hosting pornographic content because obscenity or morality is not a ground for blocking websites under Section 69A of the IT Act. The DoT can also issue specific directions to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) under the Unified Access License to block websites in public interest (Clause 7.12) or to prevent transmission of obscene content (Clause 38.1). This follows the process as prescribed under the Blocking Rules, 2009 and as per the understanding of MeitY and DOT any such directions are confidential as per Rule 16. IFF is at present assisting a legal challenge to the lack of natural justice in this process. Judicial: A website may also be blocked pursuant to a court order. Many of them stem from claims of copyright infringement or defamation. Another additional category are PIL\u0026rsquo;s on grounds of decency, morality and other group harms. After these court orders are passed they are sent to MeitY and the DoT for compliance under Rule 10 of the Blocking Rules, 2009. Such court orders along with the lists of URLs have historically been divulged as they are public information by MeitY but only after RTIs are filed. We have previously been provided access to court orders, however such practices are inconsistent.  So stemming from these two main branches the least the government can do is proactively take steps to provide transparency when websites are directed to be blocked as per court orders. We recently took action on it!\nFor public disclosure of court directed blocking On April 9, 2021, we wrote to the DoT \u0026amp; MeitY requesting them to institute a proactive process for public disclosure of website blocking orders. We highlighted that the disclosure of court orders directing blocking of websites, URLs or applications is not barred under any existing provision and on the contrary there is precedent to the opposite. Disclosure of the applicable court order will not only ensure transparency and fairness, but also foster public trust in the public authorities that are constrained to block websites in accordance with law.\nSince, MeitY is the nodal ministry as per the Allocation of Business Rules for theimplementation of the IT Act, 2000, putting into place a structure under which these orders can be proactively disclosed by MeitY will only demonstrate a commitment to transparency. This is also in consonance with the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, (2013) 12 SCC 73 which stated that the requirement under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, as amended, to remove or disable access to information can only be pursuant to a court order and/or a request by the appropriate Government, and that such order must strictly conform to the subject matters laid down in Article 19(2) of the Constitution.\nIn this age of digital communication, protecting online speech has become extremely vital as it is used not only as a medium of expressing democratic opinion and this can only be done when reasons for blocking specific websites are made public in a proactive manner. Therefore, we made the following recommendations in our representation:\n That MeitY in coordination with DoT may institute a proactive process through an online portal for disclosures of website blocking orders. That when DoT and MeitY receive a court order requiring them to block a particular website, URL or application, a copy of the relevant court order be disclosed as well. That this disclosure be made on a quarterly basis to ensure transparency in the issuance of these orders as well as to ensure that over-broad censorship of online speech is curtailed.

Prior to this we had also made RTIs seeking further information on this FRT deployment. On April 8, 2021 we received a reply from them however they failed to adequately respond to any of our concerns. Read our analysis of their reply below.\nActions to prevent FRT systems on students Today there is an ongoing conversation on the need to postpone CBSE examination as we see a surge in Covid cases across the country. Here, some proposals have been made for the conduct of these examinations through remote means. This may bring up the worrying prospect of deployment of facial recognition as an authentication technology. We have good reasons to fear such outcomes that may threaten the privacy of students all over India. It connects to our prior work, for which we have several updates to provide you on the basis of responses from CBSE.\nWe first became aware that CBSE is using facial recognition technology to provide access to digital documents to students by a news report published in the Indian Express on October 22, 2020. The application enables students to download their digital academic documents of classes 10 \u0026amp; 12 after a live image of the student is matched with the photograph on the CBSE admit card already stored in the repository. Spurred into action from this news report, we filed a Right to Information request with CBSE bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/03761 on October 28, 2020 asking them to provide information about the scope and nature of the project. In its reply dated November 24, 2020 bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/03761/3176, CBSE stated that it was not using facial recognition technology, instead it was using face matching technology, in an attempt to create a measure of difference between the two.\nAs a result, we filed another RTI request on December 10, 2020 bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/04158 asking CBSE to explain how the face matching technology operates. In its reply dated January 27, 2021, CBSE failed to respond to our queries satisfactorily. In our request to them we had asked them to share with us a step by step process of the working of the “face matching technique”. However, the reply failed to provide us with any details about how the face matching takes place as well as how it is distinct from facial recognition.\nIn addition to filing RTI requests for information on the application, we also sent a representation to the CBSE dated January 21, 2021. In our representation, we highlighted our concerns related to privacy and exclusion. In light of these concerns, we recommended that CBSE cease use of facial recognition irrespective of the nomenclature being used for it as face matching for any of its deployments.\nWhat did the CBSE say in its reply to our representation? In its reply dated April 8, 2021, the CBSE has again reiterated that it is only employing a “face matching technique” and not using FRT. However, CBSE hase once again failed to convey any meaningful distinction between the two processes. We believe that this is just a tactic to dilute the issue through use of confusing nomenclature.\nThen, the reply moves on to responding to our analysis of the program based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1. While we commend the CBSE for trying to reason within the existing privacy standards as set by the Supreme Court, we find it’s justification to be erroneous for the following reasons.\n Legality: CBSE asserts that since it does not retain the data collected from the “face matching technique”, it does not need to show legality of the program or the existence of a law which allows them to regulate the program. This understanding is incorrect since the intrusion into the privacy of the students takes place the moment the photograph is uploaded into the facial recognition database. Privacy does not only arise from data at rest, but also when personal data is used for processing. Further, in the absence of any legal basis which mandates non-retention of biometric data under the program, it cannot be proven that no data is being retained since there is no Data Protection Authority to verify such assurances. It is important to consider that such data may also be shared with third parties who may be private organisations, hence verification becomes essential. Proportionality: Additionally, the use of FRT by CBSE fails to satisfy the proportionality requirement of Puttaswamy, since, according to the reply sent to us by CBSE, FRT is just one of the authentication mechanisms being used under the multi-factor authentication process in place and is voluntary. Therefore, it is clear that CBSE does have alternatives to the use of FRT which are less invasive to the privacy of students. Procedural guarantees to check against the abuse of State interference: Finally, there are no procedural guarantees in place to ensure that misuse of the technology does not take place thereby increasing the risks related to its use. The CBSE has only responded in part to how the data is secured against breaches but has failed to respond to how internal misuse will be curbed.  Read our full analysis of the program here.\nThe second wave is a time for care We note how the CBSE responded positively accounting for the care of students by cancelling examinations for the 10th standard and deferring those for the 12 standard till June, 2021 as we see a surge in Covid cases across the country. Here, some proposals have been floating for the conduct of these examinations through remote means. This again may bring up the worrying prospect of deployment of facial recognition as an authentication technology. We have good reasons to fear such outcomes that may threaten the privacy of students all over India. It connects to our prior work, for which we have several updates to provide you on the basis of responses from CBSE. We urge the CBSE to consider these risks keeping the welfare and the rights of students in mind. This includes safeguarding them from invasive technologies such as FRT systems.\nProject Panoptic While we thank CBSE for engaging with us on this issue, its responses remain unsatisfactory. At the same time such engagement is a step in the right direction towards improving institutional practices around personal data and sensitive public officials and decision makers against the deployment of FRT systems. Under Project Panoptic, we have been tracking all ongoing use of facial recognition technology in the country.\nWhat can you do?

Sharma stated that facial recognition technology (FRT) would be used in conjunction with Aadhaar to authenticate the identity of people seeking vaccines. Working with Rethink Aadhaar and a team of volunteers, we have released a joint statement opposing this initiative, that is co-signed by more than 10 organisations and 158 individuals, many from the public health movement. In the statement, we highlight our concerns on the use of this inaccurate technology for access to vaccines and how it may lead to potentially life threatening exclusion. Sign on to the statement here!\nUpdated on April 19, 2021 As on April 19, 2021, the joint statement has been endorsed by 16 organisations and 505 individuals. We have sent this joint statement along with a brief covering letter to Dr. Ram Sewak Sharma and the National Health Authority. The endorsements have also been updated in the table below.\nWe will continue to update you with regard to the next steps we take on the issue as we consider further advocacy actions depending on the response received from the authorities, which may immediately commence with measures towards transparency by filing Right to Information requests.\nWhat happened? In an interview to The Print, the CEO of the National Health Authority, Dr. R.S. Sharma, who is also the former Director General of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), said that,\n “Aadhaar-based facial recognition system could soon replace biometric fingerprint or iris scan machines at Covid-19 vaccination centres across the country in order to avoid infections”.\n While currently the Government is using biometric fingerprint or iris scan machines for the purpose of authentication of identity at vaccination centres, they could soon be replaced with FRT by the Government which believes that use of FRT will help in avoiding infections. According to the interview, the pilot for the program has already been initiated in Jharkhand.\nFollowing severe backlash from privacy as well as public health organisations, Dr. R.S. Sharma, on April 10, 2021, clarified that Aadhaar based FRT usage for access to vaccines is just a “proof of concept” at this stage, and won’t be made mandatory even if it is rolled out across the country. However, even non-mandatory use of Aadhaar based FRT is extremely problematic and should be immediately halted. We discuss our concerns on use of FRT in the next section.\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare __ had earlier clarified __ in the Lok Sabha that Aadhaar was not mandatory to receive the vaccine, which was reflected in the ICMR’s guidelines on the vaccination process, which listed the multiple forms of ID that would be accepted. However, in fresh guidelines released in early April, Aadhaar was listed as the \u0026ldquo;preferred\u0026rdquo; mode of identity verification. However, a public interest technologist, Anivar Aravind has posted the following screenshot from the COWIN platform.\nJoint Statement by more than 10 organisations and 158 Individuals The undersigned human rights and digital rights organisations and individuals, including those from the public health community express their deep concern on the National Health Authority’s plans to use facial recognition for “contactless” COVID-19 vaccine delivery. Facial recognition technologies (FRT) pose a grave threat to human rights, including privacy, and are being rolled out in the absence of a valid legal basis. We recognise that the timely and efficient delivery of vaccines is vital. However, the use of facial recognition for authentication does little to ensure this, and will in addition put in place rights-infringing technologies that enable mass surveillance and the erosion of fundamental rights.\nThe unchecked rollout of FRTs increases the risk of unchecked government surveillance, and mission creep. Evidence has shown that FRTs are not accurate and linking this untested technology to the vaccination roll-out will only exclude persons from the vaccine delivery system.\nR.S. Sharma, the current head of the National Health Authority, and former chief of UIDAI said in a recent statement that the “Aadhaar-based facial recognition system could soon replace biometric fingerprint or iris scan machines at Covid-19 vaccination centres across the country in order to avoid infections.” This has given rise to considerable concern and anxiety for many who are yet to be vaccinated. FRT deployment would result in a drastic change in existing government policy for an inclusive rollout of the vaccination process. As per stated government policy, note that biometric authentication is not currently being used in the vaccination process. As the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare clarified in the Lok Sabha, Aadhaar is not mandatory to receive the vaccine, and the ICMR’s guidelines on the vaccination process are clear that multiple forms of ID will be accepted.\nFRTs pose an alarming threat of exclusion, harms to privacy, with a high likelihood of function creep.\n _Exclusion and discriminatory outcomes: Linking welfare schemes to Aadhaar and its biometric verification system has caused mass exclusions, and has even led to_ starvation deaths. As Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and Rethink Aadhaar have_ warned before_, conditioning access to healthcare on Aadhaar, or, as in this case, an untested facial recognition system, will increase the risk of exclusion. Introducing this technology will only impede the process of vaccine delivery. Facial recognition is_ not an accurate mode of identification_ - as IFF_ has noted_, “no FRT has been found to have a 100% success rate. Implementation of an error-prone system without adequate legislation containing mandatory safeguards, would deprive citizens of essential services.” Even the UIDAI’s_ 2018 circular_, that introduced facial recognition as a mode of authentication for Aadhaar, noted that it was to be used “in fusion mode,” as an additional mode of identification. In the absence of any national standards to regulate this technology, the possibility of adopting inaccurate or faulty systems increases. An error-prone FRT system, as the only mode of identification, would lead to false negatives, as the system will not be able to correctly identify individuals, and arbitrarily deprive them of access to essential government schemes, in this case, COVID-19 vaccines.__ _Harms to privacy: The use of this technology violates our fundamental and constitutional right to privacy, a right affirmed by the Supreme Court in_ Justice Puttaswamy v/s Union of India. Any infringements of this right must be necessary and proportionate, in accordance with procedure established under the law, and subject to strict oversight. The proposal to introduce facial recognition for vaccine delivery meets none of these standards._ Function creep: Available evidence indicates several instances where FRTs when initially deployed to a specific purpose are then extended to others. For eg. in December 2019, IFF sent_ a representation_ to the Delhi Police in response to reports that it was using an_ Advanced Facial Recognition Software_ to identify protestors, which was initially obtained to reunite missing children with their families. In July 2020, IFF sent a_ legal notice_ to the National Crime Records Bureau, against their development of the National Automated Facial Recognition System, reportedly the world’s largest FRT system._  As India careens into a “second wave” of COVID-19, it is crucial that the government’s focus stays on increasing the speed, range and efficacy of vaccine delivery, and not use it to test out privacy harming technologies. The pandemic offers the Centre and State governments an opportunity to expand peoples’ access to healthcare as a matter of right, ensure healthcare is accessible and affordable, and that accessibility is not limited by imposing conditionalities such as enrolment in digital identification projects, or being coerced to use privacy harming technologies.\nOur demands are direct with the shared intent of ensuring the prompt and universal delivery of vaccines in a rights respecting manner to mitigate the tremendous harm resulting each day to thousands of Indians due to this pandemic. We call on the Government of India and public officials, specifically Shri R.S. Sharma to :\n Issue a public statement clearly stating that compliance will be ensured with existing government policies for vaccination that focus on universal and inclusive delivery rather than making Aadhaar and FRT based authentication as a basis, or pre-condition for availing it. Transparently disclosing all technical and financial details of the FRT based system, whether any pilot studies are being conducted or being considered for the rollout of FRT based system. We urge that such necessary disclosure must be facilitated with open sourcing the algorithm for the proposed FRT based system. As part of any potential pilot programme, conduct an independent human rights and equity audit that includes a privacy impact assessment of the FRT based system.  We urge for consideration and reflection as India stands at a critical juncture in its fight against COVID-19. Here, we need to follow the path of constitutionalism through a respect for rights and advance social justice rather than restrict it by risky, experimental and harmful technology deployments of Aadhaar based FRT systems.\nWe all need to remain vigilant on FRT System deployments FRT is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based technology system which learns to recognize faces on the basis of the data sets that are fed to it. Research has shown that FRT shows high levels of inaccuracy in correctly identifying faces due to the use of biased datasets. Existing bias creeps into these datasets through the people who design them and is reinforced. (Read our review of the Coded Bias documentary which beautifully highlights the work of the women leading the charge against FRT)\nThis inaccuracy, which is inbuilt into the system, leads to false negative results. A false negative result occurs when the FRT fails to correctly identify the person. This will result in exclusion of the people from access to the schemes for which the authentication of identity was being carried out. We have already seen this occur in the case of Aadhaar to the extent that exclusion led to starvation deaths. Combining these two inaccurate systems will only lead to compounding the existent exclusion.\nIndia is currently at an extremely crucial juncture in its fight against this pandemic and the COVID-19 vaccine is essential to this fight. The foremost way of mitigating the harms of this deadly disease is to ensure that vaccination against COVID-19 is prioritised. The Government has a duty to ensure that any unnecessary hurdles to access to the vaccine are removed. However, with the introduction of this new policy initiative, the Government is increasing them without cause.\nIn addition to this, under our Project Panoptic, we have been warning against the function creep of this harmful technology since last year. Function creep occurs when a technology or system gradually widens its scope from its original purpose to encompass and to fulfill wider functions. This is the major concern among many privacy experts with regard to the use of FRT wherein they are worried that its use will exceed the indicated purpose of authentication of identity and will end up facilitating state-sponsored mass surveillance.\nList of existing signatories (Organisations and Individuals)    Organisations     Centre for Financial Accountability (CFA)   Growthwatch   Health, Ethics, and Law Institute of Forum for Medical Ethics Society   Indian Kanoon   Indian Social Action Forum - INSAF   Indusviva HealthSciences pvt LTD   Internet Freedom Foundation   Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Chhattisgarh   Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, India   Jan Swasthya Abhiyan-Mumbai   Jharkhand Nagrik Prayas   National Alliance for Maternal Health and Human Rights   Punjab Women Collective   Rethink Aadhaar   Swathanthra Malayalam Computing   The Bachchao Project       Individuals     Dr Mira Shiva   A   ASHAR A   ASWIN.B   Aakash Puttige   Aarav   Aarushi Chadha   Aayomi Sharma   Abdul Kalam   Abhay Rana   Abhijith   Abhimanyu Chandra   Abhinav Badola   Abhinav M   Abhinav Sahai   Abhishek   Abhradip Acharya   Abid   Abin Alikunju   Adarsh M Madhu   Adarsh Ranjan   Adhil Ameen P J   Aditi Mittal   Aditya   Adrija Chaudhuri   Adv.

The objective it hopes to achieve is on finalisation to provide a blueprint for the judiciary to adopt and implement digitisation. Since comments on the vision document have been invited by April, 23 we are encouraging feedback by providing a main outline that helps you understand these issues. Our outline notes the obvious positives of transparency and efficiency, while noting some preliminary concerns on data protection, the digital divide and automation of judicial functions. We encourage wide participation not only by lawyers, academics and technologists – but every Indian passionate about improving our justice system.\nFirst, how to participate?  Document link:Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III How to participate: Submit your comments on [ecommittee@aij.gov.in] or submit them on the CIVIS platform. Last date: Comments on the document by the 23rd of April.  Massive changes are underway We often hear for the need for judicial reforms. But does technology have a role to play in it? In the 21st century, the judiciary continues to operate in the brick and mortar (and paper?) world, and suffers from a large pendency of cases which have only increased during the pandemic.\nLast week, as a response to these challenges, significant developments took place at the Supreme Court. First, the Supreme Court E-Committee invited comments on the Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III. Second, the Chief Justice launched the Supreme Court Portal for Assistance in Court’s efficiency (SUPACE) which is an AI driven tool designed to assist judges with processing information. Interestingly, SUPACE is not discussed in the draft vision document of e-Courts project Phase III. And third, Justice D.Y Chandrachud, who heads the E-Committee indicated that it was at the anvil of finalising rules for live streaming of court proceedings across the country. These massive changes will change the interactions of citizens with the judicial branch and it is important we all pay attention, and if possible, participate in consultative processes.\nWith this objective we are providing an outline of the Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III. This 86 page document, drafted by a sub-committee of the E-Committee, is going to set the template of how our judiciary moves towards digitisation over the next few years.\nWait, what happened in phases I and II? Despite being perceived as stodgy and glacial (often a fair criticism!), the judiciary has shown a remarkable foresight for adopting technology. The E-Committee of the Supreme Court was established way back in 2004 and has the objective of ‘Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enablement of the Indian Judicial System’. Since then the E-Committee has introduced Phases I and II of e-Courts Project with an overall budget of approximately 2400 crores.\nPhase I focused on the nuts and bolts of digitisation - setting up hardware, ensuring internet connectivity, digitising case records and operationalising the e-Courts platform. Phase II provided systems which operated independent of each other and catered to the needs of the litigant, such as National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) which permits citizens to check pendency of cases across the country, virtual courts, E-Seva Kendras and the eCourts Services App.\nWhile this process has taken years (17 years since it started), the digitisation has helped the judiciary become more efficient. But is such efficiency sufficient, or failing to utilise existing digital tools and processes? Also, does it provide solutions that may create independent problems, or fail to address existing ones?\nWhat is Phase III of the e-Courts Project? The draft vision document suggests a plan of action for Phase III of the eCourt Project. As per the document, Phase III, as opposed to Phase II, seeks to adopt an ‘ecosystem’ approach where systems interact with each other. The document suggests several ambitious developments such as a digital case registry, a repository of case law, intelligent scheduling, digital case management system, an interoperable criminal justice system, E-Filing and open digital hearings. All of these developments will be based on ‘an intelligent system that enables data-based decision making for judges and registries’ and the system ‘combines the vast body of judicial data to foster legal literacy.’\nWhile these developments are welcome, they will be brought in without any independent evaluation of Phase I and II of the project, as much as, without data protection legislation. Now let us, draw some broad strokes on how we are initially looking at the draft vision document. We request the IFF community to post on the Internet Freedom Forum and help steer us on whether we are omitting anything or if there are any critical areas that we have failed to notice!\nThe good      Database of legal precedents: As the vision document rightly points out, a ‘database of all legal precedents must form the backbone to a judicial system based on common law’. As of now, lawyers have to use websites such as Manupatra, SCCOnline and Indian Kanoon which do not provide case law from district courts. Moreover, Manupatra and SCCOnline are expensive and only further the digital divide. Lawyers also use websites of the High Courts and eCourts platform, however these only provide case law from particular courts. A freely available repository developed by the judiciary will enable lawyers from all backgrounds to undertake high quality legal research and foster legal literacy by permitting citizens to read judgments. Data Protection: The document undertakes to develop phase III with the principle of capturing minimum personal identifiable data, keeping the transient data in memory only and storing data in anonymised ways. However, this in no way is a substitute for data protection legislation and there are problems with processing data at such a scale without a legislation. Nevertheless, the undertaking from the sub-committee that data of individuals will be protected, is encouraging. Standardisation: Currently different lower courts use different methods to classify a case. The usage of different vocabulary makes research difficult and does not permit interoperability of data across courts. Standardisation will enable interaction of data between different services. We have faced difficulties because of the lack of standardisation. After Section 66A was struck down by the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India, IFF collaborated with Civic Data Labs to develop Zombie Tracker, a website which tracks cases where individuals were being charged under Section 66A despite its unconstitutional status. As we have highlighted here, collecting such data was difficult because Section 66A was classified in different ways on the eCourts platform. Research-friendly Approach: The draft vision document’s approach also involves development of infrastructural capabilities which will permit researchers, academics and private actors to undertake research and develop solutions. This is encouraging. Till now, all ‘e-services’ have been provided by the judiciary and other stakeholders have not been able to develop their own solutions which interact with the tools developed by the judiciary. Provide templates to judges: The document proposes the creation of templates for judgments which can be used by judges. The template will be based on analysis of certain inputs by judges, other data from the case and data from similar cases that have been disposed. These templates will only be suggestions, however, and are not intended to replace the decision making process of the judge. This will help save a lot of precious judicial time, and can be a major factor in decreasing case pendency. However, we need a lot more clarity on the systems which will be used to develop such templates and deployed (think about our district courts). Here, we need clear checks to avoid it from becoming a mechanical method in which the application of mind is jettisoned in favour of operational efficiency. We are of the initial view that we should be mindful of automating justice that may also creep in risks of lack of accountability. Hence, this specific proposal should be put to rigorous scrutiny and annual reviews without any institutional bias for proceeding with it due to investment of resources.  Some initial concerns emerge  The distance between bharat and digital india: As we have pointed out previously, whether or not one has access to the internet is dependent on the demographic they belong to. While access has certainly been increasing, digital literacy continues to remain low and is likely to remain an issue for decades. Further, technology systems if deployed compulsorily may exclude litigants from access to court services. Hence, backward compatibility will be essential and budget outlays for physical filing and registry functions will need to be maintained for a long period of time. The document does contemplate training judges, court staff and lawyers in ‘specifics of technology’. The large scale digitisation does not account for how it will impact litigants on the other side of the digital divide. Centralisation: As per Articles 227 and 235 of the Constitution, the High Courts are responsible for administration of lower judiciary. The Supreme Court can overrule the High Court on the judicial side but cannot control its administration. Admittedly, this has led to lack of standardisation which makes sharing of information across state lines difficult. Nevertheless, since the power is vested in High Courts, the E-Committee or the proposed National Judicial Technology Council ought to provide adequate measure of discretion to high courts. It may be noted that the document does say that the ‘High Courts have the strategic autonomy for digitisation and configuration of digital services for their state judiciary’. Moreover, the sub-committee has consulted with High Courts while preparing this document but concerns on centralisation do remain. Robo Lawyers**:****** Another ambitious suggestion from the sub-committee is creation of a portal which will use appropriate data from eCourts database to provide a citizen information on justiciability of their case, the court with jurisdiction over their case and applicable legislations. The portal will then proceed to give information to the citizen on ‘_outcomes of filing a suit’_ or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) options. Such advice and nudges for ADR options, may if not correctly designed lead to what are termed as dark patterns that reduce individual autonomy and result in behavioural changes. We note that such proposals, while seemingly beneficial will be applied to complex questions of law and fact on which even lawyers may have different opinions. An automated portal cannot be trusted to give an authoritative answer on these questions. If such a step is undertaken, there must be grievance redressal mechanism against advice from the portal which is patently incorrect.  Major concerns      Surveillance: The document discusses an ‘Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS)’ which makes data interoperability between different institutions such as police, prisons and courts. This was implemented in part during the earlier phases but data was not entirely interoperable. In this phase, the Committee seeks to ensure ‘seamless exchange of live data between arms of the criminal justice system’ which will allow for ‘seamless tracking and prioritising of processes’. Researchers such as Srinivas Kodali have pointed out that since ICJS is housed within the Ministry of Home Affairs, the large scale collections of data will permit investigative agencies to undertake surveillance. This is of particular concern, since the draft vision document does not make clear how it intends to limit the purposes for which the collected data will be used and there is no data protection law and neither is there any meaningful surveillance reforms. Delegation of judicial duties to ‘transformative technologies’: Most of the developments proposed in the document seek to computerise administrative processes. However, the document also seeks to computerise judicial duties. The document states that transformative technologies can be used to resolve cases under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and Employee Compensation Act, 1923 ‘that do need application of judicial mind’. This is a radical proposal. In this regard we have the following concerns:   This proposal requires an amendment to these legislations. Parliament in its wisdom has empowered judges to resolve these disputes. Such a power cannot be delegated. There is no clarity on what these ‘transformative technologies’ are and how they operate. If the Committee intends to empower a code to impose civil liabilities (hopefully this does not extend to criminal liabilities) on litigants, it ought to have provided more information regarding the code from the outset. This proposal is also seemingly contrary to the comments of the Chief Justice of India at the launch of SUPACE that artificial intelligence will not do decision making. Most importantly, there are serious constitutional concerns over whether a code can perform a judicial function.  Next Steps Please note that our analysis of the draft vision document are only presumptive to invite a critical lens and are open to correction. These concerns are based on an initial reading of the document and we are continuously studying it. Again, we want to hear from you and hope to encourage a broader conversation! The sub-committee has invited suggestions to the draft vision document. We are in the process of drafting these suggestions and we shall update the IFF community once we submit those suggestions. In the meantime, we encourage you to also review the document and submit their suggestions at [ecommittee@aij.gov.in] by April 23, 2021 which is the last date. You can also submit your suggestions on the CIVIS platform.\nImportant documents  Draft Vision Document of e-Courts Project Phase III (link) IFF post highlighting the digital divide in India (link) IFF post discussing the lack of standardisation on the eCourts portal (link) CIVIS Platform (link) Zombie Tracker website (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/digitization-of-indian-judiciary-phase-iii/","summary":"E-Committee has released the draft vision document of e-Courts Project Phase III.

The hearing related to Saurav\u0026rsquo;s RTI requests in relation to the security and privacy aspects of the development of the Aarogya Setu app. While the Court was unable to hear our matter today, due to a shortage of time we take this opportunity to brief you on this case that relates to transparency around Aarogya Setu, the work and arguments that have gone in it and how we are looking forward to our day in court!\nBackground Saurav Das is an independent journalist and a motivated RTI activist passionate about transparency, privacy and fundamental rights. As detailed in our previous post, Saurav approached us to advance his legal remedies for an order dated October 26, 2020 by the Central Information Commission (CIC). The CIC declined to allow him to attend a hearing in respect of the public information officers it had summoned.\nThis case relates to an unreasonable denial of information relating to privacy and security aspects of the Aarogya Setu app. Since May 2020, Saurav has been trying to obtain information about creation of the Aarogya Setu mobile app which was launched by the Central Government as a COVID-19 surveillance measure. Many features of Aarogya Setu have led to concerns about its misuse of personal data for commercial and law enforcement purposes.\nThrough his RTI work, Saurav has managed to uncover information about the Aarogya Setu app that shows its current functioning does not comply with provisions of the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol. However, there is still a lot of information about the creation of the app which is not available to the public. For this reason, he had filed several RTIs with the relevant government authorities and sought a copy of the entire file relating to Aarogya Setu which would contain information about the origin of the proposal, people and government departments involved, correspondence between private sector executives and government officials, file noting(s), minutes of meetings etc.\nAn improper denial of a RTI on Aarogya Setu It is Saurav\u0026rsquo;s case that the authorities did not respond to the RTI for three months even though the RTI Act requires them to respond within 30 days. When they did respond, the Public Information Officers of the National Informatics Centre (which built the App), the National e Governance Division (responsible for e-gov projects) and the Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (which owns the App) all claimed that information relating to Aarogya Setu is not held by their respective departments. Aggrieved by the lack of a response from the public information officers of these departments, he approached the Central Information Commission (CIC).\nThe CIC observed that the denial of information by the CPIOs was unreasonable, however, at a hearing dated November 24, 2020, where Saurav was not allowed to attend despite several requests, the CIC issued a final order accepting the government\u0026rsquo;s claim that the information sought by him was already available in the public domain, and declining to take action in the show cause proceedings against the CPIOs. Subsequent to the final order being issued, the government authorities shared certain documents with him which were already available in the public domain but which did not answer the specific queries in his RTI application.\nOn his instructions and representing him, lawyers from IFF filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court challenging the CIC’s refusal to grant him a hearing prior to passing the final order which incorrectly disposed of his complaint and dropped the show cause proceedings against the Public Information Officers.\nA Tale of Two Charts The case previously came up for hearing before the Delhi High Court on January 19, 2021, where both parties were directed to file a chart indicating the information sought and the information provided. This would be tremendously useful to the court in narrowing down on the area of controversy. Basically what Saurav asked for and what information has been supplied to him under the RTI Act.\nWe filed a chart promptly with our best efforts towards demonstrating the specific non-compliance that required the intervention of the High Court. The Respondents, however, filed a chart bringing up multiple RTI requests that Mr. Das had filed in relation to completely different aspects of the Aarogya Setu application. The Respondents also incorrectly claimed that they have responded entirely to all information requests.\nAt a subsequent hearing dated February 24, 2021, the Delhi High Court granted us one week’s time to file a rejoinder in respect of the Respondents’ chart. We filed a rejoinder reiterating that Saurav’s chart reflects the correct picture of the information sought and received. In a nutshell, the information in the public domain and that provided by the Respondents relates to the functioning and operation of Aarogya Setu. On the other hand, the his request is with respect to the decision making that was carried out away from the public gaze, such as \u0026mdash; proposals, consultations, and other relevant documents relating to the creation of Aarogya Setu - none of which are in public domain and have not been disclosed by the Respondents.\nWe further pointed out in our rejoinder that the Respondents have failed to answer the substantive case of the Petitioner. Their Compliance Affidavit does not deal with the averments and arguments in the Petition. The Respondents have provided a list of RTI applications filed by Mr. Das relating to the Aarogya Setu app, emphasising that the Petitioner has filed 9 RTI applications, with 55 total queries, and that no RTI request is pending, to try and paint Mr. Das’ RTI requests as frivolous. However, the nine RTI applications relate to different aspects of the Aarogya Setu app that have no connection with the relevant RTI that formed the subject matter of this petition. We also found and averred that the Respondents initially, incorrectly claimed that no information was available, even though it became evident from subsequent responses, that such information was in fact available with the Respondents all along.\nThe value of persistence The case was listed towards the end of the Ld. Single Judge’s board on April 11, and by the time it reached, the Court unfortunately did not have time to hear it. The Ld. Single Judge, however, remarked that she wished to hear the parties at length, and would require a large amount of time to be set aside for arguments. The matter has been posted for August 21, 2021, and we will keep you updated on subsequent proceedings. We are hopeful and remain committed to advance transparency in digital policy making. Applying this value to our work and given the large public interest we are making the pleadings available since they have come on record of the Court.\nImportant Links  Writ Petition filed on behalf of Saurav Das (link) An Application to file additional documents on behalf of Saurav Das, containing our Chart (at pages 131- 139) showing the information asked for, and the information received (link) Respondent’s Chart showing the information asked for, and the information received (link) Rejoinder filed on behalf of Saurav Das (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;Delhi HC issues notice to govt in petition challenging denial of RTI regarding Aarogya Setu #SaveOurPrivacy\u0026rsquo; dated 19.01.2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/how-we-are-helping-rti-activists/","summary":"Updates from the High Court of Delhi on the writ petition of Saurav Das who is challenging the Central Information Commission\u0026rsquo;s order denying him information on Aarogya Setu.","title":"Sustained, strategic litigation helps advance transparency in digital policymaking #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"    Tl;dr Cybersecurity researchers have reported that the personal data of 50 crore plus Facebook users, which includes over 60 Lakh Indian Facebook users, is available on the internet for free. This is yet another data breach in a series of data breaches. We have ourselves addressed several such breaches in the past, and this is the second such post only in the last fortnight. In this post, we discuss the steps you can take if your data has been compromised because of the breach. We also discuss the steps we take to ensure the security of your data over the internet. One of the steps we take is raising digital rights concerns with competent authorities. To address the concerns of Indian Facebook-users affected by the data breach, we have written to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN), asking them to initiate an inquiry over the breach under Section 70B(6) of the Information Technology Act, 2000.\nBackground On 31st March 2021, we provided details of the data breach of Indian MobiKwik users and pointed out five steps we expected MobiKwik to take to alleviate the situation. On 3rd April 2021, information on another significant data leak surfaced. The leaked data pertains to information on users collected by Facebook as a pre-condition to avail its services. Vice had first reported this leak in January 2021, stating that a bot was selling data of 500 million plus Facebook users. Now, a cybersecurity researcher has revealed that the data of these 50 crores plus Facebook users, which includes over 60 Lakh Indian Facebook users, is available on the internet for free. The data contains sensitive information of users such as phone number, Facebook ID, location, past locations, birthdate, email address and relationship status. This data breach violates the privacy of lakhs of Indians and puts them at risk of various kinds of frauds including identity theft. These are real risks that put millions of Indian to risk of potential cyber criminals and online scams.\nFacebook’s response Facebook has not informed the users whose privacy has been compromised. Facebook has instead claimed that the data is from 2019 and that it had fixed the issue back then. However, even if the data is from 2019, the breach is still concerning because individuals do not change their personal information, especially email addresses and phone numbers, over such a short period. Also, this breach speaks to fairly weak cyber security practices by a large silicon valley company that literally has billions of dollars in revenue. This demands a more thoughtful and considerate approach by them. They should notify users whenever a breach takes place and also a review of it’s policy by which it seeks large amounts of information including the phone numbers of its users. We also have reason to be circumspect, as if we go by the logic of the explanation, Facebook despite being aware of the data breach since 2019 did not inform users. Facebook needs to do better starting now!\nHow can you respond to the breach? We have reviewed advice from several cyber security experts and also hope to provide you with actionable advice on what you can do to mitigate the risks which emerge from data breaches. Please exercise your own judgement, because by all means, we are not perfect and such personal decisions must be made only after reflection of your risk levels, independent study and research. For one, you need to get better invested with the emerging policy and laws around data breaches. For instance there is no clear legal requirement that is triggered on a data breach for your right to know if you have been affected by the breach. This is difficult because Facebook has not yet informed users. Moreover, as we highlighted here, the law as it stands and the proposed Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB, 2019) do not even require Facebook to inform users whose privacy has been violated.Second, while laws may not be very helpful, to overcome this information asymmetry, you can use either haveibeenpwned and, “Safe me”. We think these solutions are relatively safe but ask you to exercise independent judgement. Haveibeenpwned is a free to use website where users can learn whether their accounts have been compromised. The website does this by aggregating information from data breaches, and you can check out more information on its functionality - here. “Safe me” is an app that is available over android and IOS, and it assesses the cyberisk of a user on a scale of 1 to 5. Interestingly, the app has certain courses which one can take to improve their ‘safety score’.Third, once you find out that your Facebook data has been compromised and if you want to avoid such a situation again, the best option is to delete your Facebook account. However, most of us cannot afford to do so because of the sheer market dominance of Facebook. It is a hostage situation - all our friends, families and colleagues are on Facebook. If Facebook permitted interoperability, we could have interacted with our connections who are on Facebook through a more secure social networking website. Since this is not the case, experts suggest that affected users should change their passwords immediately and consider removing information that does not ‘need’ to be on Facebook.A word of caution - such responses are a bandage on a bullet hole. To prevent such breaches, we need structural changes that ensure that such breaches do not even occur. If they do, data processors such as Facebook in this case, act in a responsible manner. This is why we engage with the development of the Data Protection and cyber security laws. Currently, we have been analysing PDPB, 2019 through a four-part series and we have previously critiqued Facebook’s Human Rights Policy and WhatsApp’s privacy policy.\nHow are we raising this issue? Apart from the above, to address this massive data breach of Indian Facebook users, we have addressed a letter to CERT-IN. CERT-IN is responsible for collecting, analysing, and disseminating information on cyber incidents and undertaking measures to handle cybersecurity incidents. We had written to CERT-IN even after the MobiKwik breach and are thankful to them for acknowledging our request. The agency had assured us that it would take appropriate action. In this letter, we have highlighted the concerns we have raised above and requested CERT-IN to inquire into the data breach of Indian Facebook users. We have also asked CERT-IN to call upon Facebook to explain why such a breach took place, examine the period from which the data pertains and publicly disclose its steps to remedy the situation. We are hopeful that an enquiry by CERT-IN will make Facebook provide relief to the affected users. We will continue to follow-up and assist CERT-IN regarding both the data breaches that have come to light in the past few days.\nImportant Documents  Our letter dated 8.04.2021 to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team to conduct an inquiry into the data breach Indian Facebook users (link) IFF post discussing the MobiKwik data breach (link) IFF post highlighting other recent security breaches (link) IFF post pointing out the security vulnerability of a website that provided for on-boarding services with BHIM (link) IFF post discussing the need to provide legislative protection to security researchers for responsible disclosures (link) Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

There is, of course, a lot to write about, so think of this as a list of the key issues with the bill such as: the dilution of user’s rights, non-consensual processing of data, ambiguities in the definitions, the threat of large scale surveillance, a lack of independence of the Data Protection Authority, and the stifling of social media\nWhat we’ve already learnt Part 1 of our series dealt with the need for a data protection bill, and illustrated emerging threats that threaten our modern digital life. We also provided some historical context for the Bill, and gave some updates on what the future lies with respect to the report of the joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.\nThen came Part 2, in which we dug into the nitty gritties and explained the various provisions of the Bill. We began with an explanation of all the definitions and jargon, and then showed how the Bill:\n provides users with certain Rights; lads down a consent mechanism for the processing of personal data; imposes on obligations on data collectors and processors lays down transparency and accountability measures to be followed provides the government with certain exemptions  We also provided an update on the Bill: the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill will now be releasing its report in the first week of the monsoon session. As we said, this gives us time to ensure that we, the citizens of India, understand and analyse the Bill so that India can implement a robust data protection framework that protects the rights of users.\nIn this post, we want to highlight the key issues with the Bill that we feel require the most scrutiny. Our analysis here draws heavily from our earlier work under the SaveOurPrivacy campaign, through which have been writing about privacy regulations vociferously over the last 2-3 years. However, while we do go into some detail in this post, our aim is to provide a sampler of issues for the reader to engage with. A more detailed and in-depth dive into these very concerns shall be forthcoming.\nDilution of user’s rights Whilst the Personal Data Protection Bill does grant individuals certain rights and protections, it also makes the exercise of these rights difficult. For example, data principals can withdraw their consent for the processing of personal data; however, it is not as easy to exercise this right as it sounds. The Bill states that if the withdrawal of consent is without any ‘valid reason’, the data subject will have to bear the legal consequences of such withdrawal. Here, the burden to prove that the reason for withdrawal was valid is on the data principal. This is against the principle of consent under the Bill which requires that consent should be as easy to give as it is easy to withdraw. Further, it is not clear what constitutes \u0026lsquo;valid reason\u0026rsquo; and what the nature and extent of the legal consequences contemplated under the section are. The threat of legal consequences would deter the data subjects from exercising their right to withdraw consent to data processing, questioning the freeness of consent.\nThe Bill creates a further impediment to the exercise of the rights of data principals by allowing data fiduciaries to charge a fee from the data principals for processing their requests. Such a provision does not take into account prevailing socio-economic conditions in India, and the fact that in India technology is used by the rich and the poor alike. Hence creating a fee requirement would create a gap in the exercise of the rights under the Bill, where certain rights under the Bill would become the prerogative of the rich.\nProcessing of data without consent Chapter III of the Bill provides for certain grounds for the processing of data without the consent of the data principals. While some of the non-consensual grounds for processing data seem to be standard clauses, there are certain provisions that raise concerns. One such provision is that personal data can be processed by the State without consent for delivering services or benefits and for the issuance of any certification, license or permit to the data principal. This is very broad and it needs to be balanced by giving some limited rights to the data principals.\nThe most worrisome clause under the non-consensual grounds for processing data is the exemption given to employers. Employers can process the data of employees without their consent for the recruitment or termination of employees, for delivering services to employees, for verifying the attendance of employees, or for the assessment of the performance of the employees. These purposes are very broad and do not respect the privacy of the employees. The blanket exemption given to the employers from the consent requirement would allow them to engage in various monitoring activities under the guise of assessment of the performance of the employees. Indeed, such practices are already taking place: for instance, the PSU Broadcasts Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL) had put out a tender last year to procure employee tracking smartwatches.\nReasonable purposes The reasonable purposes clause is another exemption that allows data fiduciaries to process data without the consent of the principals. The Bill also enumerates some grounds which count as reasonable purposes. One such ground is the processing of publicly available personal data. This exemption is untenable as it undermines the fact that informational privacy does not make a distinction of publicly available personal data. This is a very dangerous exemption as it allows both the State and private actors to process publicly available data of individuals for various purposes such as discriminating against individuals based on their political and religious views, political advertisements, profiling, etc.\nSocial media intermediaries The voluntary verification of users of social media intermediaries raises concerns of violation of privacy and profiling of users. The Bill classifies certain significant data fiduciaries as social media intermediaries and requires them to provide mechanisms to enable its users to voluntarily verify their accounts. Such verified users are given visible marks of verification. User verification and visible marks impede online anonymity, which is an important feature of the internet. Anonymity is very important in online space as it creates a safe space for the users to express their views without any fear. And it goes without saying that an attack on anonymity is an attack on privacy. Moreover, it is not proven that anonymity fuels fake news, hate speech and the online abuse on social media.\nAnother danger inherent in the voluntary verification of users is that the social media entities get access to official identifiers of the individuals such as ID card, Aadhar etc. Identification documents are sensitive personal data and hence the sharing of these documents requires utmost caution and care. These measures give social media entities easy access to sensitive data which can be used for creating user profiles and engage in more advanced targeting.\nSurveillance The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 gives the government unabated access to personal data without adequate checks and balances against surveillance. The various provisions under the Bill are in fact enablers of State surveillance. The exemptions granted to the State under the Bill empower the Central government to exempt ‘any agency’ of the government from the provisions of the Bill, and to prescribe the procedure, safeguards and oversight mechanism to be followed by such agencies. This is quite alarming as it enables the intelligence and law enforcement agencies to process the data of the individuals without being subject to the provisions of the Bill and engage in mass surveillance. With the government having the powers to lay down the boundaries within which the surveillance has to take place the Bill makes the government the arbiter of its own actions. The broad exemptions granted to the State can render the rights and protections granted to individuals under the data protection Bill meaningless.\nIndependence of Data Protection Authority An independent Data Protection Authority (DPA) is one of the core principles of data protection laws. The DPA has a significant role in determining the rights of the individuals under the Bill and hence, for the effective protection of the rights of individuals it is pertinent that the DPA is an independent authority. However, the independence of the DPA has been called into question by the various sections under the Bill. Firstly, the Bill does not mandate the requirement of a judicial member in the composition of the DPA. This would lead to executive dominance of the DPA impairing the independence and accountability of the DPA. Secondly, the DPA is bound by the directions of the Central Government, which only adds to concerns about the DPA essentially becoming beholden to the Centre.\nGovernment access to non-personal data The data protection Bill is a special legislation dealing with the protection of personal data of natural persons and the application part of the Bill makes it clear that it does not apply to anonymised data under section 91 as an exception. Section 91 empowers the Central Government to access non-personal personal data with any data fiduciary or data processors for framing policies for the digital economy. This section seems to be a misfit in the Bill as the objectives behind the section are not in consonance with the objectives sought to be achieved by a personal data protection regime. Moreover, the extant literature doubts the existence of anonymised personal data as anonymisation can be reversed. We have voiced similar concerns about the draft framework for the governance of non-personal data, which is thoroughly unconstitutional and ignores concerns about privacy and data monopolies.\nThis is the third blogpost in our series on the Data Protection Bill; read part 1_ here_ and part 2 here. Join us next week in part 4, where we delve into alternative models of data protection legislation that address the concerns listed here.\nImportant Documents  The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (link) The SaveOurPrivacy Campaign (link)  This post was drafted with the help of Fathima V N, who is a 2020 graduate of the National University of Advanced Legal Studies and is currently a Daksha Fellow.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/why-is-the-data-bill-being-criticized/","summary":"In the third edition of #StartFromScratch, we explain the key issues with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.","title":"#StartFromScratch: Why is the data protection bill being criticized?"},{"content":"    Tl;dr In this explainer, we delve into the various executive and policy measures taken to expand India\u0026rsquo;s digital infrastructure and improve internet access. We have focused mainly on the National Digital Communications Policy, 2018, since the policy is cornerstone of India\u0026rsquo;s digital infrastructure framework.\nAn Introduction Digital infrastructure, internet connectivity, and access to the internet - all of these metrics are seeing improvements in recent times. However, as we have pointed out recently, a persistent digital divide still remains, and so further governmental efforts are needed to boost internet access.\nLast month, reports emerged that the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has proposed to update the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act 1933 to bring the legislative framework in line with new technologies and emerging trends. As of now, not much is known about these amendments, except that they shall be drafted by the National Law University, after which it shall be put towards a consultation process with various stakeholders.\nWe believe that the Telegraph Act is as important to India telecommunications policy as, say the National Digital Communications Policy, as it forms a part of a goal and implementation framework through the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the DoT. These goals are reached through specific offices and programs which also provide statistics and benchmarks for monitoring and evaluation. IFF believes not only that universal access to the internet is essential, but also that such access must be provided in a manner in which people are free to exercise their fundamental rights and not become a Faustian bargain. It is in this light that we have decided to look into the existing policy and regulatory initiatives to increase internet connectivity and improve India’s digital infrastructure.This is a complex area that experiences a complicated interplay of policy components and programme components, and so such efforts are our attempt to understand this field. In the past, we have focused on issues such as mapping the digital divide, analysing Central schemes, scrutinising budgetary allocations and economic forecasts, fighting for 4G internet in underserved areas, and writing to the DoT and the TRAI. Our analysis is grounded in the context of 4 key datasets: 1) Annual reports and subscriber data from the TRAI, 2) annual reports of the DoT, 3) The National Family Health Survey, and 4) responses to questions in Parliament.\nThe State of Internet Access Today As we have mentioned before, India is experiencing chronic inequalities with respect to internet connectivity. This is borne out by the latest Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators for July - September 2020: the number of internet subscribers increased to 776.45 million, a 3.66% increase over the previous quarter. The number of urban and rural subscribers increased from 455.98 million and 293.09 million to 474.11 million and 302.36 million respectively. Overall internet tele-density (the number of internet subscribers per 100 persons) increased to 57.29 (3.4% increase over the last quarter), with rural and urban internet tele-densities at 33.99 and 101.74 respectively (3% and 3.4% increase over the last quarter). TRAI subscription data also shows that the total number of broadband subscribers increased from 747.41 million in December 2020 to 757.61 million in January 2021. As these numbers show, the picture is improving, but much more work needs to be done to ramp up internet connectivity and address inequalities.\nWhat legislative and policy programmes have been undertaken?    Document Recommendations/provisions     National Digital Communications Policy, 2018 Key Central government policy for harnessing emerging technologies for expanding the availability and scope of telecom-based services.   National Broadband Mission Launched under the NDCP to facilitate universal and equitable access to broadband services across the country, especially in rural and remote areas.   BharatNet Public sector enterprise formed for the purpose of setting up a national Fiber Optic Network across all 2.5 lakh gram panchayats across the country.   Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) Set up to provide widespread and non-discriminatory access to quality ICT services at affordable prices to people in rural and remote areas.   Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules, 2016 Notified under the telegraph Act ,1885 to simplify the grant of permissions for the creation of telecom infrastructure.   Broadband Readiness Index Index created under the NDCP to assess States/UTs with respect to the creation of high quality digital infrastructure, attracting investments, simplifying procedures, and creating institutional mechanisms between the Centre, states, and local bodies.   Measures taken to reduce financial stress on TSPs The Centre has taken certain steps to boost the sector, such as increasing the time period for spectrum payments and introducing a moratorium for certain spectrum payments.   Prime Minister Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) Launched under the NDCP, the scheme liberalises the spectrum regime and encourages the formation of Public Data Offices to boost internet service availability.    Since the National Digital Communications Policy, 2018 is the cornerstone of India’s digital infrastructure policy, we will focus on it here.\nThe National Digital Communications Policy, 2018 The National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP) was approved on September 26th, 2018. The key objectives by 2022 are the following:\n Provisioning of Broadband for All Creating 4 Million additional jobs in the Digital Communications sector Enhancing the contribution of the Digital Communications sector to 8% of India’s GDP from 6% in 2017 Propelling India to the Top 50 Nations in the ICT Development Index of ITU from 134 in 2017 Enhancing India’s contribution to Global Value Chains Ensuring Digital Sovereignty  The NDCP replaces the National Telecom Policy, 2012, and upgrades the 2012 policy keeping in mind “changes and advancements in the digital communications ecosystem”. Recognising that “digital infrastructure and services are key enablers and critical determinants of a country’s growth and well-being”, the policy aims to ensure that all indians are able to take advantage of the digital revolution in a manner that: a) is equitable and affordable and b) secures them against potential threats.\nCreating Robust Digital Communications infrastructure The first vertical (or “mission”) that the NDCP proposes is creation of digital infrastructure. The proposed outcomes of this vertical include: a) providing Universal broadband connectivity at 50Mbps to every citizen, b) providing 1 Gbps connectivity to all Gram Panchayats of India by 2020 and 10 Gbps by 2022, c) enabling 100 Mbps broadband on demand to all key development institutions, and d) enabling deployment of public Wi-Fi Hotspots.\nThese outcomes would be achieved by the following steps:\n Implementing broadband initiatives such as BharatNet and GramNet Establishing a national fibre optical fibre grid to provide optical fibre networks in Tier I, II, and III cities as well as rural areas Improving and expanding upon spectrum allocation and utilisation Liberalising the spectrum sharing regime Promoting next generation access technologies Developing an ecosystem for satellite communications Channelising and broadening the scope of the Universal Service Obligation Fund  Enabling Next Generation Technologies and Services: The second prong of the NDCP focuses on incentivizing investments and innovation to grow the IT sector. The proposed outcomes of this vertical include: a) attracting investments of USD 100 Billion in the Digital Communications Sector, b) increasing India’s contribution to Global Value Chains, and c) creating innovation led Start-ups in the Digital Communications sector.\nThese outcomes would be achieved by the following steps:\n Catalyse investments for the Digital Communications Sector Reforming and rationalising regulatory regimes Creating a roadmap for deploying emerging technologies Enabling Hi-speed internet, Internet of Things and M2M by rollout of 5G technologies Promoting research \u0026amp; development in Digital Communication Technologies Creating a Fund for R\u0026amp;D in new technologies for start-ups and entrepreneurs to enable innovation Supporting Start-ups with various fiscal and non-fiscal benefits Building technical expertise and knowledge management for Public Sector Units  Ensuring Sovereignty, Safety and Security of Digital Communications The last mission of the NDCP is geared towards securing digital sovereignty and effecting a safe and resilient digital communications ecosystem. The proposed outcomes of this vertical are: a) establishing a comprehensive data protection regime for digital communications, b) ensuring net neutrality, c) deploying robust digital communication network security frameworks, and d) building capacity for security testing and establishing appropriate security standards.\nThese outcomes would be achieved by the following steps:\n Amending regulatory frameworks, to incorporate provisions with respect to privacy, data protection, and net neutrality Ensuring that core data protection, security, and net neutrality principles are applied and enforced Aligning with global standards on safety and security Facilitating lawful interception of all Digital Communications for implementation of law and order and national security Establishing a Security Incident Management and Response System for the Digital Communications Sector  Implementation Status According to the government, significant progress has been made in implementing the NDCP. In response to a Lok Sabha question on 24th March, 2021, the government answered that:\n Several Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) projects and schemes such as BharatNet, Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan, and Provision of telecom towers in Left Wing Extremism affected areas are being implemented. Several initiatives taken by the Government and Telecom Service providers have boosted economic activity and created several job opportunities. The recently approved PM-WANI framework will further boost such economic activities and create a sizable number of jobs in the country and encourage entrepreneurs. Services such as eCommerce, FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech, AgriTech, UrbanTech, and eGovernance have seen a sizeable uptake in activity. Consumption of these services has led to 5 times growth of the wireless data consumption in the country. Exports of telecom equipment have increased (Rs 11,023 crore in 17/18 to Rs 37,963 in 19/20) while imports have decreased (Rs 1,49,546 crore in 17/18 to Rs 1,06,195 crore in 19/20), strengthening India’s contribution to global value chains. Appropriate conditions have been incorporated in the telecom licenses for the protection of privacy and confidentiality, ‘National Security Directive on Telecommunication Sector’ has also been recently notified  What is public opinion with regards to the policy? The policy has seen a mixed response. For example, the Internet and Mobile Association of India called several steps in the policy, “a step in the right direction” that would result in, “efficiency improvements, economic benefits, and reduced human exertions”. The Cellular Operator Association of India said that the policy would pave the way for the development of telecom and digital services in the country. The focus on mobilising revenues and investment towards digital infrastructure has also been praised.\nHowever, some of the goals have been criticised for being unrealistic, while the lack of an analysis of the learnings from earlier policies. A lack of specificity and clarity has also been pointed out, while the policy has also been accused of relying too heavily upon existing programmes. The reliance on a fixed-line broadband has also been questioned, given the overwhelming usage of mobile data in the country. On the economic front, commentators have said that the policy failed to adequately address existing issues such as crippling debts across the telecom sector and the huge imports of telecom equipment.\nWhat have other state governments done? Several state governments have taken significant steps towards improving internet access. The Tamil Nadu government in 2018 rolled out low cost public wi-fi zones in 5 cities across the state. The Kerala government has launched the K-Fon project. Acknowledging internet access as a basic human right, the project aims to provide free high speed internet to the poorest 20 lakh families in the state, and involves building out large scale fiber optic infrastructure across the state for commercial and non-commercial operations. Meanwhile, the Delhi government has approved the setting up 11,000 public free wi-fi hotspots across the city.\nIssues with the NDCP A comprehensive policy should ideally include an analysis of the policies it builds upon. Understanding earlier policies and how well they were implemented is a key part of policy making, as it allows policymakers to understand implementational challenges that may arise. Unfortunately, as has been pointed out by others, this is something the NDCP lacks. For example, the National Telecom Policy, 2012 too had set high objectives, especially with respect to rural connectivity, yet some of those objectives were not met. Indeed, the National Telecom Policy itself was criticised along similar grounds, and so the NDCP had provided an opportunity to right these wrongs.\nThe lack of analysis leads to another issue, which relates to the objectives of the policy. Many of the objectives are indeed quite commendable. However, some of them suffer from a lack of insight about the achievability of these goals, while some of them lack specificity about implementation. Consider the following: one of the goals of the NDCP is universal broadband connectivity of 50 Mbps to every citizen. This is of course a singularly remarkable goal, and is indeed desirable. However, this fails to account for the existing state of affairs. For example, an independent report has stated that as of August 2020, 685.6 million (~50%) Indians remain disconnected from the internet.\nAnother issue is the over-reliance on the private sector. While IT sector growth is imperative, infrastructure building may not always be amenable to private sector approaches. As we had pointed in our analysis of the PM-WANI scheme, a key part of addressing the digital divide not only means providing universal access, but also doing this at rates which would be affordable. Given the high initial costs in infrastructure development, along with the reliance on exports for telecommunication equipment, the private sector may not be able to fulfill the latter goal. Even the public-private partnership model would be helpful, as such projects would face similar issues to those faced by private sector endeavours. Moreover, the failure of such models in India, especially in the infrastructure sector, has been well documented. In a post-COVID economy still trying to get back on its feet, the private sector may simply not have the either the financial reserves or the appetite for risk that would be required to undertake large scale projects to build up digital infrastructure.\nRecommendations In light of the above, here are a few suggestions to address these issues:\n Comprehensive Digital Infrastructure Deployment Plan: An appropriate body, such as the National Broadband Mission, must constitute a high level technical committee must oversee a country wide survey, that must be conducted with the aim of assessing state of internet connectivity in each district and drawing up a concrete and comprehensive plan for initiating digital infrastructure projects in each district, including the mode of service delivery. Increased USOF deployment for digital infrastructure: The Universal Service Obligation Fund must be the primary medium of broadband deployment, especially in marginalised areas. USOF funds have often been used for governments for non-telecom purposes. Indeed, as of 2020, of the Rs. 1.04 lakh collected under the fund, only Rs 52 lakh has been allocated to telecom projects. Increased spending on digital infrastructure: Budget 2020-21 contained significant allocations towards digital infrastructure. While this is to be commended, such high allocations must be backed up by actual expenditure. To this end, government entities such as BharatNet and BSNL must be operationalised to provide cheap high-speed internet. Access should not be at the cost of civil liberties: IFF believes not only that universal access to the internet is essential, but also that such access must be provided in a manner in which people are free to exercise their fundamental rights and not become a faustian bargain. Hence, preservation of net neutrality, free speech and privacy need to be the first principles to expand internet access across bharat!

We have focused mainly on the National Digital Communications Policy, 2018, since it is is cornerstone of India\u0026rsquo;s digital infrastructure framework.","title":"Improving Internet Access: An Explainer"},{"content":"    tl;dr Since our last report for the month of February, IFF has filed 23 RTI requests, 5 first appeals and 1 second appeal. We also participated in a hearing at the CIC for another second appeal that we had filed in 2019. Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of March, we have up till now filed 23 RTI requests, 5 first appeals and 1 second appeal with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government.\nNote: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month\u0026rsquo;s report may be included in the present report.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 19 RTI requests, 2 first appeals and 1 second appeal with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:\n AAI-Airport Director, Kolkata Airport, Ministry of Textiles, Department of Economic Affairs, National Thermal Power Corporation, Department of School Education and Literacy, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation, Hyderabad Police, TS Technology Service Ltd.  Additionally we also filed requests with:\n The Department of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare, Department of Defence, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Road Transport \u0026amp; Highways, Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Govt. of Karnataka \u0026amp; Home Department, Maharashtra on the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020. The Ministry of Road Transport \u0026amp; Highways on a news report titled - No toll booths on highways: What is GPS imaging technology on vehicles for toll collection?- published in the Mint on March 18, 2021. The Ministry of Social Justice \u0026amp; Empowerment on the representation sent by the Internet Freedom Foundation bearing reference no. IFF/2021/004 on January 25, 2021.  We filed the following first appeals:\n In response to the reply received from the Delhi Police on our request related to a report titled, DNA fingerprints, facial recognition used to probe riots cases, says Delhi Police chief, published in The Print on February 19, 2021, we filed a first appeal. In response to the reply received from the Excise Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi on our request, we filed a first appeal.  Further, this month we filed a second appeal with the Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology on the Committee Of Experts On Non-Personal Data Governance Framework. A second appeal usually takes around 2 years to be taken up by the Central Information Commission (CIC) however, we believe that in asking for accountability and transparency from the government, persistence and patience is key. This can be seen from the second appeal that was taken up by the CIC this month.\nOn March 25, 2021, one of IFF\u0026rsquo;s second appeals in the CIC was up for hearing for the disclosure of comments on a public consultation on the Personal Data Protection Bill. The CIC accepted our submissions and directed the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to re-visit the RTI application and provide us with a revised reply and the comments, if no valid exemptions could be claimed. Read more here.\nFree Speech and Censorship Our other main focus is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the last month, we have filed 4 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Home Department, Maharashtra on a representation sent by the applicant bearing reference no. IFF/2020/156 dated August 6, 2020. The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology on the Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 which were notified on February 25th, 2021. The Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting on the Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 which were notified on February 25th, 2021. The Ministry of Home Affairs on the Cyber Crime Volunteers programme launched by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).  We filed the following first appeals:\n In response to the reply received from the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited BBNW on our request related to websites, URLs or applications blocked pursuant to any order/decree/judgment passed by a competent court during 2020 and 2021, we filed a first appeal. In response to the reply received from the MTNL-Delhi office on our request related to websites, URLs or applications blocked pursuant to any order/decree/judgment passed by a competent court during 2020 and 2021, we filed a first appeal. In response to the reply received from the MTNL- Mumbai office on our request related to websites, URLs or applications blocked pursuant to any order/decree/judgment passed by a competent court during 2020 and 2021, we filed a first appeal.  Processes are equally important! In addition to this, we are also continuously updating and expanding our internal RTI tracker to ensure that our ever-growing repository of requests stays upto date. Perfecting these processes is essential as we grow over time to ensure that IFF’s commitment to quality is upheld.\nImportant Documents  Digital Transparency: A Right to Information Report for February, 2021 dated March 2, 2021 (link) CIC observes that IT Ministry\u0026rsquo;s denial on RTI for comments on the Data Protection Bill is, \u0026ldquo;grossly improper\u0026rdquo; dated April 2, 2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/digital-transparency-a-right-to-information-report-for-march-2021/","summary":"Since our last report in the month of February, IFF has filed 23 RTI requests, 5 first appeals and 1 second appeal. .

As promised, part 2 of our series on the data bill will explain the basics of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. In it, we provide an introduction to the main definitions, explain what the Data Processing Authority is, detail what rights users will have and how these rights will be ensured in practice, and lastly, explain the exemptions provided to the government.\nA Recap and an update Last time, we discussed the need for a data protection bill and indicated new threats such as data breaches, malicious hacks, and governmental and corporate surveillance that have emerged as our world becomes more and more digital. We also provided some historical context to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and hinted at some of the concerns that have been raised about the Bill.\nRegarding the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill, we have an update that reports had emerged that the Committee would postpone the submission of the report. Indeed, this came true, as on the 25th of March a motion was moved to extend the time for the presentation of the report and was adopted the very same day. Thus, as it stands, the report of the Committee shall be presented in the first week of the Monsoon Session of 2021.\nWe have time. So this means that it is even more important for the public to engage with the bill, understand what it proposes, and critique its weaker aspects so that public pressure can be applied and India implements a stronger data protection bill.\nA Glossary The most important definitions vis-à-vis the data bill are:\n Data principal i.e. you, the user. A data principal is essentially the person to whom the data ‘belongs’ Data fiduciary i.e. the entity that controls the storage of the data and defines the permitted ways it can be processed Data processor i.e. the entity that processes that data collected by a data fiduciary  Suppose you use a certain social medium (eg. Facebook or Twitter). In this case, you are the data principal, the social medium is the data fiduciary (since it collects data about you and your activity on its medium), and the entity that processes your data for, say, advertising purposes is the data processor (this may be an authorised third party entity or even the social medium itself).\nNext, we need understand the categories of data:\n Personal Data: This refers to data that may contain information about any characteristics or traits of a person and can be used to identify said person. Sensitive Personal Data: This refers to certain categories of data such as: financial data, health data, official identifiers; data on sexual orientation and activity, biometric data, genetic data, transgender status, intersex status, caste or tribe status, and religious or political belief or affiliation. Critical Personal Data: Any data notified by the Central Government to be critical data. The important thing here is that critical data can only be processed within the country.  But who will enforce the law? A Data Protection Authority The Bill (Chapter IX) proposes the creation of a Data Protection Authority (DPA). Essentially, the DPA will be the main regulator with respect to the processing of data. The Bill’s Statement of Objects and Reasons states that role of the DPA would be to:\n “protect the interests of data principals, prevent any misuse of personal data, ensure compliance with the provisions of the proposed legislation and promote awareness about the data protection”\n The Authority shall consist of one Chairperson and a maximum of 6 other full-time members, of which at least one shall have experience in law. The chairperson shall be appointed by the Central government and shall be responsible for directing the workings of the DPA.\nNow, given the central role of the Authority, several important functions have been delegated to it, including:\n Monitoring and enforcing application of the provisions of this Act Taking prompt and appropriate action in response to personal data breach in accordance with the provisions of this Act Examination of any data audit reports and taking any action pursuant thereto Specifying codes of practice to promote good practices of data protection and facilitate compliance Promoting awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in respect of protection of personal data amongst data fiduciaries and data principals Promoting measures and undertaking research for innovation in the field of protection of personal data Advising Central Government, State Government and any other authority on measures required to be taken to promote protection of personal data and ensuring consistency of application and enforcement of this Act  Apart from these, the Authority also has the power to:\n Issue directions to any data fiduciary or data processor (who are bound to comply with the orders) Ask data fiduciaries or data processors to provide any relevant information Conduct an enquiry about any data fiduciary or data processor if it believes that it has conducted its activities in a manner that infringes upon the digital rights of users or if it believes the entity has contravened any of the provisions of the Act  Thus, as one can see, the Data Protection Authority will play a vital role. But what will be the regulatory environment that DPA will protect and regulate? Read on.\nDigital Rights and Consent User consent is recognised as a key component of data protection frameworks, and this is recognised in clause 11 of the Bill, which lays down that personal data cannot be processed without obtaining the consent of the user. Furthermore, such consent is valid only if it is: a) freely given, b) on the basis of an informed decision, c) specific in nature, d) clearly expressed, and e) capable of being withdrawn. Users must also be informed about any harms that might result as a consequence of providing consent, while the provision of services cannot be made contingent upon the provision of services or the fulfillment of a contract.\nThere are, of course, certain exemptions. For example, if the processing of certain personal data is without consent may be allowed for the prevention and detection of any unlawful activity including fraud, whistle blowing, network and information security, and the operation of search engines. Additionally, there are certain exemptions that are provided to governmental agencies. More on this below.\nAlong with a consent framework, the Bill, in Chapter V, lays down certain rights that each data principal has:\n Right to confirmation and access: Users have the right to obtain their personal data as well as a summary of activities performed upon their data in a clear and concise manner. Right to correction and erasure: Users have the right to correct, complete, and update their personal data. Users also have the right to erase their personal data after it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was processed Right to Data Portability: Users have the right to receive and have transferred to any other fiduciary their personal data as well as any data generated during the provision of services. Right to be Forgotten: Users have the right to restrict or prevent the disclosure of their personal data if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or if they withdraw their consent.  Here too however, these rights are not absolute, in the sense that certain limits, technical and otherwise, are imposed upon them. For example, in the case of the right to correction and erasure, a data fiduciary may, after providing the user with an explanation, choose to reject their application, though the user can make the fiduciary tage the data as disputed. Alternatively, in the case of the right to be forgotten, all requests need to go through an Adjudicating Officer appointed by the Data Protection Authority, who will judge whether any such request is valid.\nInterregnum - What about non-personal data? You may have noticed that most of these provisions seem to deal with personal data, and so you may ask: what about non-personal data? Well, clause 2 of the Bill says that the provisions of the Bill shall not apply to anonymised data, while clause 91 empowers the Central government to: a) ask data fiduciaries and data processors to provide anonymised personal data or non-personal data to improve service delivery and b) frame policies with respect to non-personal data (as an aside, we will mention here that government released the second version of the draft non-personal data governance framework on 16th December last year, which we have written about here).\nObligations \u0026amp; Transparency Measures Another important part of a robust data protection framework is the regulation of the data collection and processing. For this purpose, chapter II of the Bill lays down certain obligations on data fiduciaries. Firstly, personal data shall only be processed for clear and lawful purposes that a user has consented to, and the privacy of the user shall be ensured while processing. Data can be processed only to the extent that is necessary for the intended purpose, and a notice containing all the relevant information must be sent to the user before collecting their data. The fiduciary must also take the necessary steps to ensure that the personal data processed is complete, accurate, and up to date. Additionally, data fiduciaries must respect the digital rights of users and retain their personal data beyond the time necessary for fulfilling the original purpose of processing, after which such data must be deleted.\nTo complement these obligations, the Bill (Chapter VI) mandates certain procedural measures that data fiduciaries must implement. Each data fiduciary must implement a comprehensive privacy-by-design policy that explains how the privacy of users and the security of their data is going to be ensured throughout processing, they can get to be certified by the Data Protection Authority if it is found to be sufficiently robust. Fiduciaries must also certain information available in a transparent manner, such as:\n the categories of personal data generally collected and the manner of such collection the purposes for which personal data is generally processed any categories of personal data processed in exceptional situations or any exceptional purposes of processing that create a risk of significant harm the existence of and the procedure for exercise of rights of data principal under Chapter V and any related contact details for the same  Some data fiduciaries will also end up being classified as significant data fiduciaries based on factors such as the volume of data processed and the turnover of the fiduciary. Such classification will bring with it additional obligations, such as the need to conduct data protection audits and impact assessments as well as the need to have a designated data protection officer.\nBoth data fiduciaries and processors shall implement necessary security safeguards, such as:\n The use of methods such as de-identification and encryption Take steps necessary to protect the integrity of personal data Take steps necessary to prevent misuse, unauthorised access to, modification, disclosure or destruction of personal data Undertake periodic reviews of their security safeguards  They must also have in place an effective grievance redressal mechanism, in which complaints must be disposed of within 30 days of their receipt.\nThe data protection Bill also specifies behaviour in case a breach occurs: data fiduciaries must inform the DPA about any breaches of personal data, detailing the type and nature of the data involved and the number of persons affected. The DPA shall then decide whether the breach should be reported to the users. The DPA may also direct the fiduciary in question to take certain actions.\nExemptions, governmental and otherwise The Bill provides for a variety of exemptions and these are some of its most criticised sections. For example, chapter III of the Bill states that personal data may be processed without consent in certain situations, including:\n The performance of any State function, such as the provision of a service or statutory benefit In compliance with any order or judgement of a Court or a Tribunal In case of a medical emergency for the data principal For the provision of public health services to combat a pandemic or any other threat to the public health By an employer with respect to a data principal who is an employee  Chapter VII of the Bill provides even broader exemptions to the government: the Central Government can, in the interest of national security and the prevention of incitement to any cognizable offence, exempt any government agency from any of the provisions of the Bill. The Centre can also exempt data processors that process the data of users outside India from the provisions of the Bill.\nThis is the second blogpost in our series on the Data Protection Bill; read part 1 here.

The CIC accepted our submissions and directed the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to re-visit the RTI application and provide us with a revised reply and the comments, if no valid exemptions could be claimed.\nBackground and sequence of events The drafting, vendor selection and choices made by the, \u0026ldquo;expert\u0026rdquo; committee have been the subject of a long standing controversy in which civil society has criticised it for lacking diversity and expertise. This can only be overcome with transparency. To further this we filed RTI\u0026rsquo;s seeking greater information not only on it\u0026rsquo;s working but the comments which were sent in response to a public consultation. This disclosure has been strangely resisted by MeitY leading us to take this case to take this case to the CIC.\nA quick timeline of the events that led to the CIC\u0026rsquo;s welcome order:\n   Date Particular     16/10/2018 RTI application filed   19/11/2018 Reply from CPIO   06/12/2018 First Appeal filed   18/12/2018 Order of First Appellate Authority (FAA)   08/03/2019 Second Appeal Filed   25/03/2021 Date of Hearing   25/03/2021 Date of Decision    RTI for transparency on the Data Protection Bill On October 16, 2018, we filed a RTI request with MeitY pertaining to the public notice dated 16 August 2018 titled, “Feedback on Draft Personal Data Protection Bill” which solicited comments from the general public on the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill. Our short information request was:\n  Kindly provide the number and a list of the names of persons who received comments and feedback\n  Please provide an inspection of any and all comments and feedback and records along with file notings of the feedback process of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill.\n  Provide a copy of all comments and feedback received in electronic form on CD or by copies made available on pen drive or email.\n  The CPIO, in its reply dated November 19, 2018, refused to provide us copies of the comments and stated that,\n “Total No. of responses received: 624. The submission made to the committee by an Individual/ Agency / Company is confidential and meant for examination by the Ministry. The submissions alluded to, will later translate into input that goes into the draft bill, that has to be approved by the Cabinet before it is introduced in parliament.”\n While the RTI Act provides the right to the public to seek information from the government to its activities, it also offers the government various exemptions from providing such information in cases such as state secrets, cabinet papers, danger to life or physical safety of an individual etc. However, to ensure procedural fairness, the government must clearly state which exemption it is invoking, when refusing to provide information. In this case, the CPIO did not cite any provision of the Right to Information Act, 2005 to support their rejection of the our request, and as such, their refusal to provide us with information was without basis, arbitrary, illegal, and in violation of a plethora judgments of Courts such as the judgment of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Sh. Rakesh Kumar Gupta v CIC, WP (C) No. 900/2021, dated January 22, 2021, which stated that the CPIO cannot withhold information without reasonable cause.\nWe file a first appeal Accordingly, on December 4, 2018, we filed an appeal before the First Appellate Authority (‘FAA’) against this reply of the CPIO. However, on December 18, 2018, the FAA disposed off the first appeal by stating that, “Under section 8.1(i) of RTI Act 2005, the information cannot be shared”. Section 8(1)(i) of RTI Act, 2005 states that:\n Section 8: Exemption from disclosure of information. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,— (i) cabinet papers including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers.\n We persist with a second appeal Not receiving a satisfactory response from the FAA, we filed a second appeal before the CIC. The second appeal was taken up for hearing before the CIC on March 25, 2021, where IFF\u0026rsquo;s Of Counsel Advocate Vrinda Bhandari was accompanied by CCG Litigation Fellow who is hosted at IFF, Krishnesh Bapat.\nWe raised the following (among other) grounds at the hearing and in our written submissions:\n The exemption under Section 8(1)(i) is limited to Cabinet Papers and accompanying materials submitted to the Cabinet Secretariat for deliberation. It does not apply to preparatory and other background information (such as. stakeholder consultations, file notings, etc.) which do not constitute a part of Cabinet Papers. Further, in relation to Section 8(1)(i) of the RTI Act, the Full Bench of the Hon’ble CIC in Venkatesh Nayak v. Dept. of Personnel \u0026amp; Training (CIC/WB/C/2010/000120) dated August 30, 2010 had clarified that the exemption under Section 8(1)(i):   \u0026ldquo;will apply only when a Note is submitted by the Ministry that has formulated it to the Cabinet Secretariat for placing this before the Cabinet. All concomitant information preceding that, which does not constitute a part of that Cabinet Note will then be open to disclosure u/s 4 (1)(c), but in a manner as will not violate the provisions of Sec 8(1)(i).\u0026quot;\n  Section 4(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 states that public authorities are mandated to disclose all relevant facts relating to important policies or decisions affecting the general public. Comments and suggestions based on which the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill was revised as well as information pertaining to the persons involved in the revision fall squarely within the ambit of this. Instead, the FAA simply rejected the our first appeal by citing an exemption under Section 8(1)(i) without providing any explanations as to the applicability of the exemption.\n  The decisions of the CPIO and the FAA are contrary to the well-settled principle that denial of access to information under Section 8 of the RTI Act is an exemption that has to be construed strictly (See Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, (2020) 5 SCC 481, para 133) Consequently, any withholding of information under the garb of Section 8 must be accompanied by applicable reasons for doing the same.\n  We also submitted that Section 8(2) provides that regardless of exemptions provided under Section 8(1), a public authority may allow access to information if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests. In the present case, there is significant public interest because the inputs form the basis of the draft of a law prepared by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology prior to being placed before the Cabinet before it is introduced in the Parliament.\nWe also received written submissions from the CPIO in which they raised an additional defense on the basis of Section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act, 2005 which states that, \u0026ldquo;information, the disclosure of which would cause a breach of privilege of Parliament or the State Legislature\u0026rdquo;, is exempted from disclosure.\nPersistence pays off (kinda) After hearing us, and giving a chance to the CPIO to be heard, the Information Commissioner, in her decision, made the following observations:\n The reply of the CPIO was grossly improper as the CPIO had failed to refer to any specific exemption clause enumerated u/s 8 of the RTI Act, 2005. The FAA claimed exemption u/s 8(1)(i) but again failed to justify the exemption so claimed. The CPIO after giving a reply stating that all documents are confidential, prior to the hearing claimed exemption u/s 8(1)(c) i.e. a new clause and again failed to justify the exemption so claimed, nor was any officer able to do so during the hearing. Under the provisions of Section 19 (5) of the RTI Act, 2005, in an appeal proceeding, the onus to prove that a denial of a request was justified shall be on the CPIO. The CPIO in his reply had clearly failed to justify his position as to how the disclosure of information would be in contravention of any of the provisions enshrined under Section 8 of the RTI Act, 2005 and what matter is confidential. In this context, the Commission referred to the decision of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of Dy. Commissioner of Police v. D.K. Sharma, WP (C) No. 12428 of 2009 dated 15.12.2010, wherein it was held as under:   \u0026ldquo;6. This Court is inclined to concur with the view expressed by the CIC that in order to deny the information under the RTI Act the authority concerned would have to show a justification with reference to one of the specific clauses under Section 8 (1) of the RTI Act. In the instant case, the Petitioner has been unable to discharge that burden.\u0026rdquo;\n Accordingly, in her decision, the Information Commissioner directed the CPIO to\n \u0026ldquo;re-visit the RTI application and provide a revised reply to the appellant as per the provisions of the RTI Act including mentioning the correct clause of the RTI Act under which exemption is being sought for denial of information and proper justification for the same. The CPIO should note that in case she is not able to justify the exemption so claimed, then the desired information should be provided to the appellant. This direction is to be complied within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of this order under intimation to the Commission.\u0026rdquo;\n IFF is committed and will keep persisting for greater transparency around the Data Protection Bill to ensure that it serves the rights of everyday, ordinary Indians than unaccountable powers and exemptions that act against their interests.\nImportant Documents  Order of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Central Information Commission in the matter of Apar Gupta v CPIO, Department of Electronic \u0026amp; Information Technology (MEITY) dated March 25, 2021 (link) Written Submissions on behalf of the Appellant dated March 18, 2021 (link) Second Appeal bearing reference no.CIC/MOIAB/A/2019/110785/MOEIT dated February 7, 2018 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/persist-transparency-dpd-cic/","summary":"In a positive order in our second appeal related to the Data Protection Bill, the CIC directed the CPIO of MeitY to re-visit the RTI application and provide us with a revised reply.","title":"CIC observes that IT Ministry's denial on RTI for comments on the Data Protection Bill is, \"grossly improper\" #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"    Tl;dr With Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal going to the polls, we thought we would do our bit for #electionfever by analysing the manifestos of political parties across the spectrum. Our analysis is guided by our focus areas - improving internet access, safeguarding privacy and digital rights, promoting innovation and technology, and cybersecurity - and is meant to help voters understand how political parties are looking at these issues.\nElectoral recognition for digital rights Digital rights are becoming increasingly important in our country for two specific reasons. First, there is an increasing number of young voters in the country, as more and more Indian youths conscientiously exercise their vote on the issues that matter to them. For example, in Tamil Nadu, out of the 6.26 crore people on the electoral rolls for the assembly election this year, 1.37 (21.86%) crore belong to the age group 18-29, of which 13.09 lakh voters belong to the age group 18-19 (2.1%). The hopes and aspirations of this young group of Indians who are digital natives rest upon the political promises of a better future. Second, more Indians come online every day. As per the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India there are about 1.18 billion telecom subscribers and 757.61 million broadband subscribers as of 31st January, 2021 with quarterly growth rates of 1% and 3.1%. These massive numbers signal that the digital divide is incrementally being bridged for scores of our fellow citizens, though, as we have pointed out recently, it requires a mission mode to close the gap. The greater adoption of digital technologies signals a continuing belief that it has the potential to make our lives better. It’s immense potential can be realised through a rights based framework. But are our political parties ready for them?\nSome Historical Context Political parties have been slow to move, if at all, on digital rights. Indeed, before the 2019 general election, only the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 2014 had mentioned anything related to safeguarding the privacy of citizens: the party had promised to implement a robust data protection law that prohibits mass surveillance and had also promised to bar the use of Aadhaar for the provision of social services. The party had also mentioned topics such as, access to the internet, protecting India from cyber attacks and surveillance all issues which were not mentioned in the manifestos of either the Bharatiya Janata Party or the Indian National Congress.\nTo accelerate a greater recognition for digital rights we released a digital manifesto of sorts making an appeal that cut across party lines prior to the 2019 general elections. This saw a marked improvement, with parties across the political spectrum realising the importance of internet access and digital rights (see here, here, and here). Besides their previous promises, the CPI(M) manifesto also included a promise to repeal section 124A of the Indian penal code (the sedition law), as well the need to curb monopolies in the telecom and digital technology sectors, promote FOSS technologies, and increase public funding of science and technology to 2% of GDP. Meanwhile, the Congress began to emphasise the need to protect digital rights. Significantly, the party’s manifesto promised to enact a legislation that would uphold the right to privacy and broadly adopted the recommendations made by us in the Digital Rights manifesto.\nImproving connectivity and internet access has still received some support even for those that were silent on other aspects of digital rights. For example, the BJP’s 2019 manifesto did consider issues of internet access and promised to connect every Gram Panchayat with a high speed optical fibre network by 2022. However, apart from mentioning the need to make financial data secure, the manifesto is mostly silent on issues of privacy - even the Personal Data Protection Bill is not mentioned. Similarly, the Samajwadi Party and the Aam Aadmi Party have spoken about increasing surveillance, with the former promising to restart the NATGRID surveillance system and the latter promising to increase CCTV surveillance in Delhi. We have written about the NATGRID before, highlighting the grave harms to privacy that could arise as a result of its implementation.\nGiven this mixed bag of sorts, we look ahead to a greater realisation of digital rights in one of the most significant state elections in recent times. Here we particularly focus on the assembly elections for the States of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. We hope it helps advance informed choices for voters who care about digital rights along core areas of access, free speech, privacy, innovation, and cyber security. We follow a rough and dirty model in which in a table we place a “+” symbol for positives, “-” for negatives, and “?” for those which as per us do not present a clear foreseeable consequence or are ambiguous.\nKerala First, we’re looking at the manifestos of the three major parties in Kerala: the BJP, the leader of the National Democratic Front; the Congress, leader of the United Democratic Front; and the CPI(M), leader of the incumbent Left Democratic Front. We have selected these parties since they received the largest share of the votes in the last assembly elections in 2016 (10.6%, 23.8%, 26.7%) as well as the 2019 Parliamentary elections (12.93%, 37.3%, 25.83%).\n   Party Increasing Internet Access and Digital Literacy Freedom of Speech \u0026amp; Privacy Promoting Innovation and Technology Cybersecurity     BJP (+) Free laptops to High School students and digital connectivity will be ensured across rural Kerala, and panchayats will be included under the eGramSwaraj to strengthen e-governance(+) Intensive public participation programme through digital literacy volunteers for making all the people in the state digitally literate by 2025 (-) Creation of a data bank with information on persons working in fields of art and culture; identity cards for them. (?) IT to be prioritised with respect to industrial PPP based “Namo Techno valleys” along the lines of the Silicon Valley model(+) Trivandrum to be developed as a core IT sector(+) Computer hardware production to be encouraged(+) New institutes for science and technology to be set up N.A.   INC (+) For Internet Access a large number of promises including subsidised devices; coupons for students to purchase laptops; establishing digital libraries and Broadband connectivity (+) Digital literacy mission to ensure digital awareness for all, with digital education and training for all students and teachers(+) Public libraries with internet facilities in all panchayats(+) All universities will publish their courses online(+) Creation of a university for legal studies and cyber law(+) Access to international journal portals to be made available at a subsidised rates for students and teachers (+) Right to be Heard Act for mandatorily ensuring that the citizens’ grievances are heard by the appropriate authorities (+) Technopark model IT park in Malabar (+) Measures, such as implementing a Kerala IT law and enabling remote work, will be taken to attract global technological companies(+) Increased transparency through publication of all cabinet decisions and governmental projects online(+) Start-up partnerships will digitise businesses including street vendors and farmers(+) Promotion of new technologies in fields like agriculture, medicine, and administration(+) Digital platform for the sale of local products without middlemen(+)Naipunya package (including courses on digital marketing, digital content creation, digital art etc) for women who prefer to work from home. (?) Strict controls and laws to be implemented against cyber-crimes and threats(?) Strong penal law against individuals who insult women on social media   CPI(M) (+) K-fon public fibre optic network to be extended, and upgraded, and local networks of cable operators in Kerala to be utilized(+) BPL families will be provided a free internet connection.(+) Unemployed educators will be provided with state-of-the-art digital skills training on a wartime basis(+) Online examination facility to be expanded(+) Hostels for Scheduled Caste Children will be provided computer labs and internet facilities(+) AI based digital platform for job seekers and skilled trainees (+) The stand taken by Kerala for Net Neutrality will continue. (+) Kerala will be the hub of India’s electronics industry, with Thiruvananthapuram becoming an AI Hub, and Kochi a cyber valley. Emphasis will be placed on future technology-based projects(+) Hardware production in Kerala will increase to 10,000 crore in five year through additional investment of 1000 crore(+) Master plan for new artificial intelligence projects to be drawn up(+) 2 crore sq. ft of IT parks and 2 lakh jobs to be created over 5 years(+) Data centres to be promoted through K-fon, alongwith tech centres and hubs of excellence (+) E-governance and governance governance-oriented framework reform will be introduced along with policy for innovation in economic governance.(+) Innovative IT systems will be utilized to prepare a five-year plan in the context of Kovid(+) Telemedicine and e-Health services will be propagated(+) Digital platform for promoting innovative problem solving with fluid registration and tendering processes, along with innovation challenge competitions for students (+) Free software will be used more in the e-governance of the state government(+) Open source based applications will be promoted to expand the use of IT in small and medium enterprises. (?) A special digital policing wing will be set up, which will include artificial intelligence, cameras, online grievance redressal systems and smart police stations.(+) Cybertech, CyberTom and Hi-Tech Cybercell will work together to create a comprehensive system of cyber security.    All three parties have put a huge emphasis on improving not just access to the internet but also on increasing digital literacy, an extreme welcome move. An even larger push has given to innovation and the promotion of digital technology across the public sector, the private sector, and governance, as can be seen by the granular and detailed proposals laid down in the manifestos.\nHowever, cybersecurity saw a muted and mixed response, with strict laws against online threats evoking eerie visions of the now repealed section 118A of the Kerala Police Act. Moreover, apart from a future Right to be Heard Act and a nod to net neutrality, no provisions promoting digital rights or safeguarding the privacy of citizens have been set forth.\nTamil Nadu Next, we take a look at the manifestos of two major parties in the state of Tamil Nadu: the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a part of the United Progressive Alliance, and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a part of the incumbent National Democratic Alliance. We have selected these parties since they received the largest share of the vote in the 2016 assembly elections (31.64% and 40.77% respectively) and the 2019 Parliamentary elections (32.76% and 18.48% respectively).\n   Party Increasing Internet Access Freedom of Speech \u0026amp; Privacy Promoting Innovation Cybersecurity     DMK (+) 4G/ 5G facilities will be provided in Government higher secondary schools and colleges (+) Every government school and college student will be offered a tablet. (+) All false cases instituted against journalists will be withdrawn (+) Cases filed by the AIADMK against striking workers and those who protested against the Sterlite, Hydrocarbon, Methane and Kudankulam projects will be completely withdrawn (+) Tie-ups between IT firms and higher education institutions will be promoted (-) Increased CCTV surveillance in public places   AIADMK (+) College students would be provided with 2 GB data for three years (+) Laptops will be provided for students studying in self-financing mode in government schools  (+) Mini IT parks would be set up in each district (+) Rs. 3,500 crore would be allocated towards online skill development training (-) CCTV cameras for all tier-II areas and major cities across the State    The manifestos of both parties contain several positive promises with respect to increasing internet connectivity and promoting innovation, though any larger plan to increase internet access is missing in both. Moreover, neither manifesto contains explicit provisions for the protection of digital rights (indeed, the Kalavan app launched by the AIADMK government has faced several questions with respect to privacy and data protection), while both seem to promote CCTV-style surveillance.\nWest Bengal Lastly, we consider the manifestos of three major parties in West Bengal: the Bharatiya Janata party, the All India Trinamool Congress, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). We have selected these parties since they received the largest share of the vote in the 2019 Parliamentary elections (40.64%, 43.69%, and 6.34% respectively), while the received the fourth highest (10.16%), highest (44.91%), and second highest vote (19.75%) shares in the 2016 assembly elections respectively.\n   Party Increasing Internet Access Freedom of Speech \u0026amp; Privacy Promoting Innovation Cybersecurity     BJP (+) 100% internet connectivity will be ensured in all parts of rural Bengal. (+) Tablets would be provided to ASHA workers to assist them in their work. (?) Courts and investigative infrastructure to be digitalised. N.A. (+) A Rs 10,00 crore corpus will be provided to the Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay fund to establish polytechnic colleges and establish science colleges with state-of-the-art facilities.(+) Rs. 300 crore would be used to set up new IT parks and develop existing ones, while Rs 100 crore will be used to set up biotechnology parks in cities.(+) Kolkata would be developed as a ‘tech hub’ by incentivising start-ups, creating co-working spaces and offering low-interest loans. (?) One nation one health ID card will be implemented and health records will be digitised. (+) A Cyber Crime division would be set up.(-) CCTV cameras would be installed on every street in Kolkata   TMC (+) A ‘digitally enriched education’ would be provided to students and teachers across schools and colleges.(+) The ‘Taruner Swopno’ will be continued to provide tablets to 9 lakh students in class XII (+) Every block shall have one model residential school enabled with digital classrooms. N.A. (+) Policies would be undertaken to bring the power of Digital Revolution to all sectors of the economy. N.A.   CPI(M) (+) Every student shall be ensured access to the internet. (+) All political prisoners will be released, and all false cases lodged on political grounds will be withdrawn (+) Knowledge-based industries like Information Technology shall be promoted. (+) A thrust will be given to small and medium enterprises, especially in the fields of information technology, biotechnology, and agro-based industries. (+) An emphasis shall be given to scientific practices and support will be given to scientific and technological research.(+) A scientific temper at all levels of society, especially among the younger generation, will be developed N.A.    Given that West Bengal suffers from low internet penetration, though all parties have tried to address the issue of internet access, a lingering feeling remains that more could have been done. However, all parties did acknowledge the vital importance of information technology and scientific advancement, which would hopefully lead to an increased focus on building out digital infrastructure. The performance of the parties with respect to promoting digital rights ranged from the mild to the disappointing. Indeed, CCTVs-on-every-street style surveillance would only infringe upon the aforementioned rights, as would the privacy concerns that would arise from projects such as the Health ID programme.\nA Digital Rights Charter We have written about such issues previously: after conversations with stakeholder groups rights experts, we had drafted a digital rights charter addressing political parties across the spectrum and highlighting the digital needs of India.\nIFF is grateful for the support of Anagha Sasidharan, a student at NLSIU Bangalore, who helped us translate these documents.\nImportant Documents  Manifestos from Kerala for the 2021 Assembly Elections (BJP, INC, CPI(M)) Manifestos from Tamil Nadu for the 2021 Assembly Elections (DMK, AIADMK) Manifestos from West Bengal for the 2021 Assembly Elections (BJP, TMC, CPI(M)) A digital rights charter for political parties (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/2021assemblyelections/","summary":"With state elections incoming, we thought we would do our bit for #electionfever by analysing the manifestos of political parties across the spectrum.

Users, security researchers and news organisations have reported that data of 10 crore Indians, including their passport details, addresses and phone numbers, is available for sale on the dark web. As per press reports, the data was in the custody of MobiKwik, which provides a mobile based payment system. While MobiKwik has denied the data breach, independent security researchers and Indian Express have verified that details of MobiKwik users are available on the dark web. We have written to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) asking them to initiate an inquiry over the data breach in terms of Section 70B(6) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. In this post, we point out the five steps MobiKwik must take to alleviate the situation.\nBackground Over the past month, several users, independent security researchers and news organisations have reported that data - over 8.2 TB in size - of MobiKwik users has been put on sale over the dark web with an asking price of 1.5 Bitcoin which is approximately equal to INR 65 Lakhs. This data leak contains Know Your Customer (KYC) details, passport details, addresses, email ids, phone numbers and aadhar card details of around 10 Crore Indians and violates their right to privacy. The data breach follows a number of other data breaches that have affected Indians.\nMobiKwik’s response MobiKwik provides access to mobile based payment systems developed by the National Payments Corporation of India. The breach was first uncovered on 4th March 2021. MobiKwik responded by denying the breach and threatened to take legal action against the security researcher who uncovered the breach and suggested that the researcher was ‘trying to grab media attention’. In the past few days, in wake of numerous reports verifying the data breach, MobiKwik released a blogpost where they again denied the data breach and have claimed that the breach could be because users ‘have uploaded their information on multiple platforms’.\nMobiKwik’s denial, which shifts the blame upon users, must be taken with a pinch of salt. Independent researchers have indicated that a data breach has occurred. Indian Express has verified that details of MobiKwik users are available on the dark web. Other reports even suggest that MobiKwik has sought help from Amazon last month after they discovered that some person who did not belong to their organisation, downloaded their ‘S3 data’.\nWhat we expect from MobiKwik We believe that MobiKwik, like many Indian technology companies, need to do better given they are today driving global innovation. It is disappointing for MobiKwik, to dismiss reports of a data breach and also issue threats against a security researcher - both steps which are against the interests of its users. We think it is necessary for MobiKwik to immediately undertake the following five steps to alleviate the situation:\n Inform users: MobiKwik should individually inform each affected user of the extent to which the data breach has impacted them. Provide redressal to users: MobiKwik should devise and implement a strategy to provide adequate remedies to such users, including but not limited to compensation to the users in terms of Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Fix accountability: MobiKwik should provide an explanation on why such a breach took place, provide details of the breach, including the number of users affected by the breach and the date and time on which the breach took place, and issue a statement explaining the steps taken to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future. Permit a third-party audit: The circumstances require that an independent agency conducts a forensic data security audit. We commend MobiKwik for making a public commitment to conduct it but it must be done independently through a firm of repute and its findings must be made public. Recall threat of legal action: As mentioned above, MobiKwik has threatened to take legal steps against the cyber security researcher who uncovered the data breach. As we have pointed out previously, cyber security researchers constantly face threats of legal prosecution even when they disclose data breaches in good faith. While there remains a need to provide legislative protection to such researchers, threatening researchers with legal prosecution is irresponsible. MobiKwik should immediately recall such threats especially since many users and other independent cybersecurity researchers have also claimed that a data breach has occurred.  Letter to Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN) In view of the massive data breach, violation of the right to privacy and the lack of a response by MobiKwik, we wrote a letter to CERT-IN. Under the Information Technology Act, 2000, CERT-IN is responsible for collecting, analysing, and disseminating information on cyber incidents and undertaking measures to handle cybersecurity incidents. In the letter, we have highlighted the concerns we have raised above and requested CERT-IN to conduct an inquiry into the data breach and conduct of MobiKwik, and require executives of MobiKwik to provide detailed explanations to their office in terms of Section 70B(6) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. We are hopeful that an enquiry by CERT-IN may compel MobiKwik to act responsibly and even provide compensation to its users as per Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.\nPersonal Data Protection Bill does not provide safeguards #SaveOurPrivacy A broader policy ask also arises from this specific incident as we have highlighted it in the past with respect to data breaches by other entities, both public and private. Considering the frequency and the scale of such data breaches, Parliament must provide statutory protections to users whose rights are violated. As we have pointed out previously, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB) does contain several clauses relating to security and breaches. For example, Clause 25 deals with the breach of personal data. The clause states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary must inform the proposed Data Protection Authority. However, the clause does not require the data fiduciary (in this case, MobiKwik) to inform the data principal (in this case, users whose data is now public). It is instead left to the Authority to decide: a) whether the data fiduciary must inform the data principal, b) the remedial action the data fiduciary must undertake, and c) the details of the data breach that can be made public.\nIn contradistinction to PDPB, a private member bill (the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019) introduced by MP D. Ravikumar guarantees data subjects the right to be informed about any breaches of their personal information, and also asks organisations to designate privacy officers to ensure security compliance.\nCurrently, PDPB is being reviewed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. A conversation around PDPB is the need of the hour and we have started a four-part series where we will talk about the need for a data law, the current bill’s provisions and loopholes, what good data bills actually look like, where accountability from authorities is needed, and what you can do to advocate for your rights.\nApart from providing statutory protection to data principals, a crucial aspect of data regulation is ‘data minimization’. The principle of data minimization involves limiting data collection to only what is required to fulfill a specific purpose. Cumbersome KYC processes result in companies having access to large amounts of data without necessarily having the ability to securely store such data.\nImportant Documents  Our letter dated 31.03.2021 to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team to conduct an inquiry into the data breach and conduct of MobiKwik (link) IFF post highlighting other recent security breaches (link) IFF post pointing out the security vulnerability of a website that provided for on-boarding services with BHIM (link) IFF post discussing the need to provide legislative protection to security researchers for responsible disclosures (link) Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

On an objective analysis of it’s recently announced Human Rights Policy we cautiously note positive measures such as support for end-to-end encryption but also provide a larger criticism. It is too little, too late and much remains to be operationalised. Moreover, Facebook Inc. continues to apply discriminatory standards for human rights enforcement in the United States and India and the concerns we raised remain unaddressed. For these reasons we call on it to improve it’s practices, openly and transparently for Indian users of its platforms including Whatsapp and Instagram.\nBackground On March 16, 2021, Facebook unveiled its Human Rights Policy which is applicable throughout the world and is relevant for India. The policy for the first time states Facebook’s commitment to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Businesses and Human Rights (UNGPs) in one central repository, applying it to all its products, in all the geographies of its operation. This is done by cataloguing its various policies, guidelines, principles and practices in one place. We believe that social media corporations such as Facebook, which perform a public function, should be held accountable, and we welcome the policy as a statement of intent but Facebook Inc.’s practices in India have been contradictory to human rights standards for a fairly long time.\nWhat is a Human Rights Policy? Silicon valley corporations like Facebook impact individual rights on a daily basis in a highly networked and digital world. This is why UNGPs calls upon such ‘business enterprises’ to maintain a minimum standard of human rights across jurisdictions. A number of Silicon Valley-based entities and members of ‘Big Tech’ also have such policies in place (for example Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon).\nDespite its market leadership, Facebook has been a laggard and has belatedly developed and published a human rights policy. This delay is inexcusable given documented cases of harmful social impacts due to Facebook’s conduct in jurisdictions such as India. For context, the 2020 RDR Index released by Ranking Digital Rights, evaluated 26 most powerful digital platforms and telecommunications companies on their practices affecting freedom of speech and expression and the right to privacy. The index scored Facebook 45/100 and pointed out that Facebook was yet to publish ‘a commitment to adhere to human rights principles’.\nWhat does Facebook’s Human Right Policy state? Facebook has compiled its myriad policies, guidelines and practices in one place. They state that their respect for human rights is applied through their Community Standards, their membership in the Global Network Initiative, the Responsible Supply Chain Program, Privacy Principles, Data Policy, Law Enforcement Guidelines, Transparency Reporting, Responsible AI efforts and Diversity and Inclusion Practices.\nThis policy formalises these commitments and that is indeed a welcome step. However, it is a step that is short in substance and remains to be fulfilled in practice especially for jurisdictions such as India. As we reason below there is a dissonance between the promises made by Facebook Inc. and the obligations it has to fulfill them. Others have critiqued Facebook’s policy here and here.\nWhat issues emerge from Facebook’s Human Right Policy\n Nothing new: The policies Facebook has compiled are dated. Moreover, these policies have a number of issues that remain unaddressed. For example, Facebook does not necessarily comply with the Santa Clara Principles when enforcing its community standards. These principles require Facebook to issue a notice to a user whose content is removed and provide them with a meaningful chance to appeal the removal. Similarly, transparency reporting by Facebook is obscure as has been highlighted here. Facebook also does not continuously report internet disruptions. As per Facebook’s transparency reporting page, the last internet disruption in India was on 28th June 2020. A number of internet shutdowns orders have been issued after that including ones that shutdown internet in Delhi on Republic Day. Only one obligation: Facebook has imposed upon itself a mandate to “report annually on how we’re addressing human rights impacts, including relevant insights arising from human rights due diligence, and the actions we are taking in response.” Facebook has not specified the particulars of these annual reports; particularly, it remains to be seen whether Facebook discloses information adverse to it. Crucially, Ranking Digital Rights has reprimanded Facebook on how it conducts human rights due diligence and questioned whether Facebook ‘conducts systematic impact assessments of its terms of service enforcement, on its targeted advertising policies and practices, on its development and deployment of algorithmic systems, or on its zero rating programs.’ Remember Facebook advocated for Facebook Zero or the Free Basics programme in India that was defeated by advocacy spurred by the SaveTheInternet.in movement. The policy does not provide for a rights audit in India: To address these concerns Facebook could have volunteered for an independent civil rights audit across jurisdictions. Facebook has previously volunteered for an independent civil rights audit after being pressured by US Congress and civil rights organisations. The audit examined Facebook’s efforts to protect human rights on its platforms, evaluated whether Facebook complies with its own policies and provided its recommendations. Similar audits ought to be conducted in other parts of the world and separate reports published. These audits are particularly important for India, where Facebook continues to exercise immense powers, operates in an opaque manner and has been criticized for its actions. However, there is zero public acknowledgement or transparency by Facebook Inc. in India of any such audit. UNGPs are insufficient for Facebook: Facebook has based the policy on the UNGPs. This is a curious choice because Facebook has immense power (by their own admission). In a paper titled, ‘But Facebook’s not a country: How to interpret Human Rights Law for social media companies’, Ms Susan Benesch (Executive Director of the Dangerous Speech Project, Berkman Klein Centre for Internet \u0026amp; Society, Harvard University) has argued that Facebook should be held to higher standards as “social media companies have human-rights impacts of great magnitude on at least half of the world’s population. They can limit not only what people say (or write) but what they see and read. When exercised in public spaces, such powers are reserved for governments.This extraordinary, transnational power and influence sets the companies apart from any other private enterprise. When platforms are used for exchanging information that is vital for civic life, the owners and staff of the platforms influence the political, cultural, and economic development of entire societies”. Apart from this, UNGPs have faced criticism, especially since they focus on process rather than on outcomes. The Human Rights Watch has questioned UNGPs for their low standards of accountability. Others have called upon organisations such as Facebook to instead adopt instruments under International Human Rights Law, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which contains a framework for imposing restrictions upon the freedom of expression. Vagueness: Facebook has stated that ‘human rights defenders are a high risk user group’ and has pointed out that it conducts due diligence to identify risks and ‘create strategies to avoid, prevent and mitigate them’. However, the policy does not reveal anything more. We do not know how Facebook protects human rights defenders on its platforms or the methodology Facebook uses to conduct due diligence.  How does the policy impact its largest, global user base? India is Facebook’s largest market. In Mark Zuckerberg’s own words, \u0026ldquo;India is a very special and important country for us… [a]nd in fact, we actually test some of our new features here first, before rolling them out globally\u0026rdquo;. The policy is relevant for Indians because:\n Facebook has committed to protecting your privacy on WhatsApp: Facebook has stated that it will not “provide governments with direct access or “back doors” to people’s information, and we would challenge any order that sought to have us redesign our systems to undermine the encryption we provide to protect people’s data.” Rule 4(2) of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 requires ‘significant social media intermediaries’ such as WhatsApp to enable tracing of the originator of information on their platform if required by the government. This may affect end-to-end encryption and the right to privacy of all Indians. Considering this far-reaching impact, Facebook’s commitment is a welcome development. We unhesitatingly support end to end encryption and any company that implements it to keep Indians safe, secure and their personal data private. The policy impacts Indian users' freedom of speech and expression: The policy reiterates Facebook’s commitment to its community standards. These standards outline what kind of content is permissible on Facebook. The policy also affirms Facebook’s recognition of the Oversight Board, which recently issued its first round of rulings. Despite the policy and the development of the Oversight Board, Facebook continues to be opaque on how it moderates content at the first instance. As pointed out by Ranking Digital Rights - ‘Facebook should significantly improve its transparency on and accountability for its content moderation by publishing consistent data on actions it takes to enforce platform rules.’ A conversation around this policy will ensure that Facebook undertakes such obligations. Relevant for Indian start-ups: While Silicon Valley led the developments in information technology over the past decade, Indian startups have started to establish themselves in this field and as the number of users on these Indian platforms grows, they ought to provide for such a policy as they build for more Indians and potentially even the world. Not only is this ethical, but it also makes sense from a business perspective. One of the reasons people are sceptical of silicon-valley based Big Tech companies is because they ignored the impact their products have on society and in the process undermined user trust. In this regard, Indian start-ups can differentiate themselves and build user trust from the beginning by providing effective human rights policies. We urge that their policies not only pay lip-service to the UNGPs but should provide a detailed explanation, make product choices, engineering decisions and implement them in practice.  Why it is necessary to critically evaluate Facebook Inc. Let us consider the facts. Facebook’s track record in India speaks for itself.\n In 2016, Facebook introduced the Free Basics program in India to collect vast amounts of data which violated net-neutrality by charging discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content. Facebook withdrew its plans only after efforts by advocacy groups culminated in a ruling by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. In 2020, Facebook failed to respond to hate speech on its platform against Muslims which often preceded acts of mob-violence. An article in the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook’s top public policy executive decided to not enforce hate-speech rules against members of the ruling party. On this issue, we have written to the Parliamentary Committee on Information Technology requesting them to summon Facebook executives, hold a hearing and direct Facebook to repatriate victims. Also in 2020, Facebook’s ‘automated systems’ blocked an account named ‘Kisan Ekta Morcha’ which documented the protests against farm laws on social media.**** In 2021, Facebook is involved in a legal dispute with the Delhi Legislative Assembly. Facebook had refused to appear before the Peace and Harmony Committee of the Delhi Assembly which had summoned Vice President of Facebook India to inquire into the Delhi Riots of 2020. As Rahul Narayan puts it this case has, “it unwittingly provoked a litigation that may have far-reaching implications on Federalism, the Separation of Powers and Fundamental Rights in India. (link)”. We agree with him that this litigation poses a huge risk to democratic processes and the rights of legislative bodies to demand accountability from large silicon valley corporations.  These are just some events that make us determined to match stated commitments with practiced actions.\nImportant Links\n Our blogpost highlighting Facebook’s discriminatory standards for human rights enforcement in the United States and India (link) Representation to Parliamentary Standing Committee on IT regarding the WSJ Story on Facebook India dated August 17, 2020 (link) Ranking Digital Rights 2020 RDR Index (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/facebook-human-rights-policy/","summary":"We analyse Facebook\u0026rsquo;s recently announced Human Rights Policy.

This was potentially a trigger for the regulation of OTT platforms under the undemocratic and unconstitutional IT Rules, 2021. We consider these complaints today against these new rules to show how it provides a heckler\u0026rsquo;s veto and will lead to censorship of speech which is otherwise legal.\nThe Tandav Controversy: A case study The \u0026ldquo;Tandav\u0026rdquo; web series was released on the OTT Platform Amazon Prime Video on January 15, 2021. Immediately upon release, it was embroiled in controversy. The series has been criticised by various factions of the Indian society for hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus. Following numerous complaints, the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting intervened and raised these concerns to the makers of the series. The makers issued an unconditional apology and also removed parts of the series that were said to be objectionable. However, dissatisfied by these steps, multiple FIRs across states were filed against the series' actors, producers and directors as well as the India head of Amazon Prime Video\u0026rsquo;s original content.\nThe controversy also spurred demands for censorship and criminal penalties for OTT platforms in India. Then on February 25, 2021 the Government notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the “Intermediary Rules, 2021”). Part III of the Rules deals with the regulation of digital news media (though there is a lack of clarity on exactly which news media these Rules apply to) and OTT platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+Hotstar and is administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. We analyse these complaints today against the backdrop of the antidemocratic and unconstitutional Intermediary Rules, 2021 to discover that they provide a heckler\u0026rsquo;s veto leading to the censorship of speech that is legal across OTT platforms in India.\nOngoing litigation around Tandav and the Intermediary Rules, 2021 As a result of multiple FIRs being filed in various states across the country, the makers of the series approached the Supreme Court and the Court agreed to club these FIRs. The Court initially declined to pass an order to protect the makers and artists of the series from arrest. However, on March 5, 2021, the Court granted protection from arrest to India Head of Amazon Prime Video, Aparna Purohit in the case registered against her.\nAt the same time, the Intermediary Rules, 2021 have faced criticism since they were notified and their constitutionality has been challenged in the Courts in the following cases:\n LiveLaw Media Private Limited and others vs Union of India and others WP(C) 6272/2021 - Kerala High Court (read more here) **Foundation for Independent Journalism and others vs Union of India and another ** WP(C) 3125/2021 - Delhi High Court **Quint Digital Media Limited and another vs Union of India and another ** WP(C)11097/2021 - Delhi High Court Sanjay Kumar Singh vs Union of India and others WP(C) 3483/2021 - Delhi High Court  Our findings through the Right to Information Act, 2005 We use the RTI Act, 2005 as a tool for demanding transparency and accountability from public authorities on issues of public importance. The Tandav controversy and the resulting conversation around censorship of OTT content is one such issue which we feel is of public importance. Therefore, on February 8, 2021, we filed a RTI request with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting asking them to share with us the complaints they received against the series. The issue also gained importance subsequently because it essentially spurred the regulation of OTT platforms through the Intermediaries Rules, 2021.\n    On March 23, 2021 we received 3 documents of a total 112 pages containing the complaints filed against the series with the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting. The broad trends that we observed in the complaints are:\n The complaints have been filed majorly in only two languages: Hindi and English. The approximate date range of the complaints is from January 16 to January 18, 2021. There is a template which has been used to file these complaints are broadly clustered within familiar themes around hurting religious sentiments and are anti-dalit. In addition to private individuals, complaints have also been filed by advocates, non-governmental organisations and functionaries of political parties.  We are reproducing one such complaint below which has been sent across by multiple complainants. These are made available as public documents while redacting the personally identifiable information.\n    The consolidated document containing all the complaints against the Tandav series sent to us by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting can be found here. We are sharing this information not only because it is a public issue but also for further academic study.\nHeckler\u0026rsquo;s veto : Contrasting OTT Rules with the Tandav Complaints A heckler\u0026rsquo;s veto is a situation wherein the government curtails the right to freedom of speech and expression of a party in order to prevent reactionary behaviour from the other party. Through the recently notified Intermediaries Rules, 2021 the government has essentially created a situation of heckler\u0026rsquo;s veto in India and seriously weakened the freedom of speech and expression in the country. We provide reasons for it below.\nClause II(A)(c) of the Code of Ethics made applicable to OTT platforms under the Intermediaries Rules, 2021, that states:\n A publisher shall take into consideration India‘s multi-racial and multi-religious context and exercise due caution and discretion when featuring the activities, beliefs, practices, or views of any racial or religious group.\n This provision therefore allows complaints to be filed that go beyond the law (as previous clauses of the Intermediary Rules, 2o21 clearly state that this provision is in addition to existing prohibitions of law) as it stands currently on freedom of speech and the reasonable restrictions that can be imposed upon this fundamental right. Further, any person having any grievance with the content that is published on an OTT platform may lodge such grievance with the Grievance Officer of the platform, who must acknowledge the grievance within 24 hours, and also address the grievance and reach a communicated decision within 15 days. It is easy to see how such a provision may be misused in a landscape where, for instance, review-bombing on app stores has led to the removal of several apps.\nThe Grievance Officer mentioned above is only tier-1 of a 3-tier system. If the response of the Grievance Officer is not considered satisfactory by the complainant, they may appeal to the second tier. The second tier is a self-regulatory body with up to 6 members who are experts in the fields of media, broadcasting, entertainment, child rights, human rights, etc. However, while this is framed as the second layer of self-regulation, this is actually the first layer of government oversight, since the composition of this body is ultimately subject to the approval of the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting. Hence, the complainant can continue escalating the complaint till they achieve the desired result.\nThe third tier is the government itself, where an Inter-Departmental Committee, comprising officers of various government ministries, including the Home Ministry, the Law Ministry, the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Women and Child Development etc., and chaired by the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. This Committee is empowered to hear appeals from the second tier, and has wide powers of punishment under the Intermediaries Rules, 2021. It can warn, reprimand, censure, admonish, require an apology, reclassify content ratings (A, U/A, U etc.), or even block or censor content as it deems fit.\n    This structure has been created without any statutory basis and without any public consultation with stakeholders. Such wide powers without constitutional or parliamentary backing are a grave threat to the freedom of speech and expression of content creators and publishers, as well as to the right of free access to information of the consumers of such content.\nThe Intermediaries Rules, 2021, their scope and the concerns regarding the manner in which they will be implemented will have a chilling effect on fundamental rights of the citizens of India, not just on the creator side, but also on the consumer side. Exerting executive control over OTT content will lead to over-compliance and self-censorship on part of platforms, who will be keen to avoid the wide discretion allowed to the government when it comes to punishments.\nOminous signs for creativity in India The Intermediary Rules, 2021 have now prescribed a process for complaint that can be premised on vague criteria even beyond existing criminal offences and civil penalties. To us this conflicts directly against the observations of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court in the classic case of S. Rangarajan Etc vs P. Jagjivan Ram 1989 SCR (2) 204 :\n We want to put the anguished question, what good is the protection of freedom of expression if the State does not take care to protect it? If the film is unobjectionable and cannot constitutionally be restricted under Article 19(2), freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on account of threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence. That would tantamount to negation of the rule of law and a surrender to black mail and intimidation.\n Important Documents  Complaints received from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting dated March 23, 2021 (link) Constitutional questions against unconstitutional Rules dated March 11, 2021 (link) Coming to streaming services near you: Self-censorship! dated March 4, 2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/tandav-case-study/","summary":"Documents accessed through RTI paint a grim picture for creativity and diversity of content for online streaming platforms in India.","title":"Tandav is a Case Study for OTT censorship under the IT Rules, 2021 #LetUsChill"},{"content":"    It’s 2021, and everything is data.\nYour conversations on social media. Your name and number and gender and beliefs. The contours of your face and the ridges of your fingertips. Data is everything you can see, and everything that you can’t.\nSo maybe you know that the Indian government is finally getting a law that seeks to protect your data from hackers, harassers, creeps, criminals, and powerful people who want to exploit it for profit. Of course, the rest of the world has had these laws forever, and it’s shocking that India has simply been functioning without one. But it’s being done now, right? This is imminent and it will become a reality within this year!\nMaybe you also know that this incoming Act, which seeks to provide the entire blueprint of how your data will be dealt with in India, and which gives you rights surrounding your own personal information, has been in the works for a while. Maybe you know that this law has to prioritise you because it’s being made for you. And then, maybe you know that a lot of people are very worried because it is going to fail spectacularly in doing this, benefiting large corporations and government powers way more than it ever even tried to benefit you.\nMaybe you even know the grave seriousness of this situation.\nRegardless of where you are in your journey with the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 - as a newbie, an intermediate, an expert, or a curious learner, a student or startup owner or homemaker or professor - we invite you on a journey where we #StartFromScratch, hashing it out alongside you with the end goal of your empowerment. Over the span of 4 blog posts and 4 videos, we will talk about the need for a data law, the current bill’s provisions and loopholes, what good data bills actually look like, where accountability from authorities is needed, and what you can do to advocate for your rights. After this 2-week conversation, you will know the ins and outs of India’s incoming data law, and the exact ways in which it affects you. We hope that you will pay attention and spread the word to other concerned (and not-so-concerned) citizens!\n    Why do we need a data law? The world is advancing technologically at the speed of light. Every single day, people come up with new and fascinating ways to use your personal information - to make your favourite app run more smoothly, to let you switch your lights off at the clap of two hands, or even to steal your identity or engage in terrorism! For a fun explanation, here’s our video that explains the need for data protection in India:\nSo we’ve known for a while that a legislation that seeks to protect your rights is the bare minimum requirement to live safely in today’s world. Such legislations help maintain a sense of accountability from the government’s end, and they formalize measures for your safety in a way that allows you to seek recourse if your rights are violated. They’re the key to having control over your life, guaranteed to you by the democracy we live in.\nMany places in the world already have data protection regulations. The EU has the GDPR, and California has the CCPA (both are really great examples that have set high standards). Countries like China, Brazil, Singapore, and Australia all have their own data protection legislations which evolve with changing times.\nFor a taste of what a good data protection legislation can do, sample this: Facebook, whose data processing practices have long been criticised, was forced to leave out the Instagram photos of its EU users from its AI training database because of the ban against the large scale scraping of data without informed consent under the GDPR. Such incidents perfectly illustrate why India needs a data protection legislation - and not just any legislation, but a damn strong one.\nMore and more Indians are going online, and so we’re pretty much at the peak of our need for data protection in the country right now. People like you - concerned citizens - are beginning to become aware of big tech companies that hoard our data and sometimes misuse it, and their business models that care more about profit than user protection. Our increased use of tech has brought with it an increased amount of data breaches, malicious hacks, and governmental and corporate surveillance. So to protect citizens, the Indian government has realised the need for our very own legislation that will govern the storage and processing of data.\nThat’s where the Personal Data Protection Bill comes in     The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 provides a framework for public authorities to govern our personal data. Here’s some vocab: As citizens and users, we are called ‘data principals’, and the proposed Act gives us certain rights. It also lays down some obligations for the processing of data by both governments and corporations. It also says that a “Data Protection Authority” has to be set up, which will regulate the processing of data in India to make sure that your interests and needs are being met, and that no one has excessive power or control over your data.\nThe preamble of the Bill states that the right to privacy is a fundamental right which **** is necessary to protect our personal data and create a culture that fosters a free and fair digital economy, respects people’s privacy, and ensures empowerment, progress and innovation.\nWhy are we doing a series on it? Well, the Parliamentary Committee which exists to deal with this Data Bill had until very recently to submit its report on the Bill to the Ministry of Electronics and IT. This is a step that will bring it much closer to actually becoming an Act that can be enforced on you (like when the Citizenship Amendment ‘Bill’ became the Citizenship Amendment ‘Act’).\nGiven the chance that this will actually happen very soon, we want to highlight the issue of the bill and the many reasons that activists and concerned citizens are saying - please don’t let this become a reality in our lives!\nThe point of the data bill is to empower you with rights relating to your own data. But in its current form, it provides large exemptions to government departments, prioritizes the interests of big corporations, and does not adequately respect your fundamental right to privacy. This move, when taken with the lack of literacy around data protection in India, may be dangerous on an individual level - where your everyday privacy is threatened - and on a collective level, given how it makes allowances for mass surveillance.At this point, some people may feel that it’s too late to raise their voices against harmful provisions. But it’s not! In fact, right now is the most important time to raise awareness and to put public pressure on our MPs so that they can enact a much better data protection legislation that will safeguard our digital rights and prioritize the interests of everyday citizens like you.\nWe have been keeping a watchful eye on all things privacy in India for a while, and have been engaging deeply with the Personal Data Protection Bill. Find out more about our initiatives at saveourprivacy.in. If you would like to fast-track and read a detailed analysis instead of following the entire series, you can check out our public analysis here.\nHere are 3 key points to get started      The bill is intertwined with our Right to Privacy. In 2017, two very important things happened: First, The landmark Supreme Court judgement in Puttaswamy case. Our Right to Privacy was enshrined as a fundamental right, as a key component of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21. The Supreme Court also directed the government to bring about a robust data protection regime. Second, the Ministry of Electronics and IT constituted the “Expert Committee on Data Protection” - a body that would strongly influence how we govern data in India. This Committee was criticised for being against the Right to Privacy judgement. However, these criticisms mostly fell on deaf ears, and so the Committee released its report in 2018.The current Data Bill is rooted in this. One of the key creators of the Bill fears that it has turned into something dangerous. The new Bill differed significantly from the previous draft and faced wide-ranging criticism, with Justice Srikrishna, the chair of the committee himself, calling it \u0026ldquo;dangerous\u0026rdquo; and with the potential for turning India into an “Orwellian State”. The Bill was then referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), which then initiated another round of consultations and hearings on the Bill. We also gave our comments on the latest draft and have been continuously and vigorously conducting public outreach on the Bill since. Along with others, we have also been pointing out the need to diversify the consultation process of the JPC. The Bill is not new - there have been a number of previous versions, each with their own unique challenges. This history of the bill includes versions through the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, a report by an Expert Committee on Privacy all the way back in 2012 which serves as an influential document on international \u0026amp; national privacy standards, several bills introduced in both Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha that put forth different models of privacy regulation, and more.  What’s going on right now? There have been many versions of the bill, but it is likely now that the next version will become an Act. However, the government is running out of time if it wants to get it passed during the budget session of parliament. The government in their responses to questions asked in the Lok Sabha, the government effectively shrugged its shoulders and said that the Bill had been referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee. It is unclear when the report of the JPC will be released.\nImportant Documents  The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (link)  This is the first blogpost in our series on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, as we explain what the Bill is, what concerns have been raised about it, and what we can expect after its implementation.

After looking at the few details of the programme available in the public and information gathered from news sources, we wrote to the UP Police highlighting our concerns.\nThe Hamari Suraksha Programme On February 14, 2021, we came across a news report titled, \u0026ldquo;For women\u0026rsquo;s safety, UP police to track porn search on internet\u0026rdquo;, published in the Deccan Herald. The report stated that, \u0026ldquo;The police have hired a company to monitor the internet searches and keep data of the people who search porn content and analyse it.\u0026rdquo; The report went on to quote the Additional Director General Neera Rawat of UP Police’s Women Powerline wing 1090 who said that, \u0026ldquo;those searching the porn content on the internet would be \u0026lsquo;warned\u0026rsquo; against doing so initially so that any possible crime could be prevented.\u0026rdquo;\nSince viewing sexually explicit material in private spaces is not illegal in India, we were worried about the potential violations of the right to privacy and free speech that may occur as a result of this programme. Subsequently we filed a Right to Information request with the Police Commissioner Office, Lucknow on February 16, 2021.\nWe also posted a copy of the request filed on Twitter to provide updates to our community about the steps we have taken on the issue. The UP Police Women Power Line responded to our tweet with a photograph which contained clarification regarding the details of the programme.\nAccording to this photograph, under the programme pop-up messages would be shown to people who visit websites which contain child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The pop-up messages will reportedly contain information to sensitise the people visiting these websites against viewing/accessing CSAM. This will be done through the help of artificial intelligence and psychographics. The Women’s Power Line also claimed that privacy of citizens would not be breached under the programme.\nKya Hamari Suraksha hogi? The programme, in the form that has been disclosed publicly till now, raises the following concerns which we highlighted in our representation to the UP Police:\n The programme lacks an underlying legal framework: The programme has been launched without any legal framework or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in place which would regulate the functioning of this programme and define its parameters. While currently the programme objective is stated to be sensitising people who view CSAM, the possibility of a function creep, where use of a technology is gradually widened beyond its original scope, is high. Lack of a legal framework also indicates that there are no safeguards or oversight mechanisms which have been put in place to ensure that no misuse of this technology takes place. There is an overall lack of specificity regarding the programme which also makes it difficult to clearly assess its potential positive and negative outcomes. Privacy concerns around the programme: The programme aims to show pop-up messages to people who visit certain websites. However, there is ambiguity with regard to how this will be carried out effectively while ensuring that privacy of internet users is maintained. One of the major concerns this programme raises is whether these users’ data, such as their IP addresses, will be collected and stored. If yes, then how will it be ensured that this data is protected against unauthorised use or a data breach. Here, it should be noted that in India, viewing sexually explicit material in private spaces is not illegal. If these pop-ups target all sexually explicit material available online then this is a violation of the rights to free speech and privacy accorded to an individual under the Constitution of India. Use of CSAM as bait: Under the programme, the Police claims to have identified certain websites or web pages which host CSAM, that will show a pop-up message when visited. The question which arises then is, why is the Police not initiating a process for taking down CSAM on these websites and web pages. Under Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000, publishing, transmitting, collecting, seeking, browsing, downloading, advertising, promoting, exchanging or distributing CSAM in any electronic form is a punishable offence. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Rules, 2020, under rule 11, also state that any CSAM has to be reported to either the Special Juvenile Police Unit, the local police, or as the case may be, cyber-crime portal who have to take necessary action on receipt of such report as per the directions of the Government issued from time to time. Hence, any such website requires criminal investigation and prosecution. Informational pop-ups on the contrary will reduce the proportional law enforcement response that is required to ensure the safety and security of children. This would also be in violation of the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court In Re: Prajwala (2015) SMW Crl. No. 3/2015 dated March 22, 2017 which held that videos depicting child pornography “should not be made available to the general public”. Positive outcomes are unlikely: The programme aims to sensitise people against accessing CSAM by raising awareness through pop-up messages. However, it is unlikely that this programme will have any measurable positive outcomes. Pop-up messages are generally used for advertisements and usually people close them without reading. Additionally, even if people do read these messages, it is not necessary that they will be sensitised and will then refrain from viewing CSAM which is still available. If the aim of the programme is to instill a perception of fear in the minds of people who access such material that they could be identified or prosecuted, it would only motivate them to find new ways of accessing CSAM, such as VPNs, and thus would ultimately fail to sensitise them against CSAM.  What to do now? In light of the concerns above, we made the following recommendations:\n A legal review of the programme must be conducted: A review of the ‘Hamari Suraksha’ programme must be implemented wherein it is ensured that the programme is in line with the existing legal provisions related to CSAM in India. A public SOP must be published: The UP Police should publish and make available publicly a SOP which would regulate the programme before it is implemented. This should contain all technical and legal details of the operation for the, “Hamari Suraksha” programme. Takedown of online CSAM must be initiated: The UP Police should initiate necessary action, such as take down of such material, against any instance of CSAM about which it gains knowledge as well as initiate criminal investigation and prosecution against appropriate parties. A privacy impact assessment must be conducted: It should be ensured that any online awareness campaign that is initiated implements measures which are privacy protecting. This can be done by conducting a privacy impact assessment of the campaign before it is implemented.  UP Police and their 360 degree \u0026ldquo;digital chakravyu\u0026rdquo; for women\u0026rsquo;s safety The Hamari Suraksha programme is a part of the digital roadmap that has been unveiled by the UP Police recently, which aims to create a Digital Chakravyuh (360 degree ecosystem for women safety) that will integrate their online and offline actions. Under the programme, the UP Police had also announced its much criticised plan to install AI enabled cameras that would generate alerts on the basis of expressions of \u0026ldquo;distress\u0026rdquo; on women\u0026rsquo;s faces, even before they make any move to report!\nWe appreciate the UP Police\u0026rsquo;s much needed initiative to increase women and child safety in the State as well as their step in identifying how technology may be used beneficially to achieve this purpose. However, we urge caution against any hasty decisions that may end up doing more harm than good.\nImportant Documents  Representation to UP Police on Humari Suraksha Programme dated March 23, 2021 (link) Why is porn being blocked in India? dated July 25, 2019 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/why-is-the-up-police-not-taking-down-child-porn/","summary":"The UP Police Women Power Line has recently launched the ‘Hamari Suraksha’ Programme.

In our letter, we commend certain aspects of the Rules however these are marginal. On balance, even they suffer from a problematic process and questionable legality that can bring real accountability to social media platforms for Indians. Further, this is a clear case of the bad outweighing the good, as several provisions of the bill are undemocratic and unconstitutional. In light of this, we called for the Rules to be withdrawn and for wide-ranging consultations to be held.\nIT Rules: Are they any good? The Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 were notified on February 25th, 2021. The Rules lay down an anti-democratic and unconstitutional framework for the regulation of online content. These concerns have been noted in our initial analysis. Such concerns demand a greater scrutiny of the Rules than has been the case, especially since no stakeholders consultations have been conducted between when they were first proposed to when dramatic changes were made and then they were notified.\nAt the same time, our analysis remains objective and we do note positive provisions such as, for example, mandating the provision of a counter-notice under rule 4 (8) (a) explaining the removal or disabling access to information or data. It will provide notices to users before their accounts are suspended or information that they post is removed. Such a move deepens the rights of users, and is to be maintained.\nRules 4(d) and 18(3) specify the need for periodic compliance reports to be furnished every month by significant social media intermediaries and publishers of news and current affairs content or online curated content respectively. These provisions ensure mechanisms for making large technology firms accountable and accessible.\nHowever, to achieve real accountability the relevant definitions require clear statutory definitions. The existence of such a vague and overbroad law will have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression, and thus would run counter to any attempts to strengthen the digital rights of citizens. In this light, it is disappointing that such welcome provisions have not been placed within a broader framework of progressive regulation.\nStill, making furnishing these notices to users and publishing periodic compliance reports the law is a good thing. Greater transparency and accountability helps build trust. This is a principle that should apply to technology platforms as well as to public authorities. But does it? We find that the prescribed paradigm is one of punitive enforcement of compliance without the necessary statutory protections for intermediaries under regulatory ‘safe-harbours’. Thus, even the positive provisions end up being only marginally beneficial, while the remaining provisions are significantly unwelcome.\nThe IT Rules: The Bad Bits Now, even the good parts of the IT Rule come with significant caveats, and may not even be implemented effectively. Unfortunately, the bad parts may be significantly worse. We have extensively analysed various concerns that arise with respect to the IT Rules: how the Rules are anti-democratic and unconstitutional, what self-regulation (read self-censorship) in the OTT sector may look like under the Rules, and our asks of MEITY and MIB with respect to the Rules, and so we know the significant harms that are likely to arise as a consequence of the Rules.\nFor example, part II of the Rules has serious implications on the freedom of speech and expression and the right to privacy of users of the internet:\n Rule 3(2) requires social media intermediaries to establish a grievance redressal mechanism by which users may complain against any content and a grievance officer has to dispose of such complaints within 15 days. An empirical study conducted by the Centre for Internet Society points out that intermediaries tend to over-comply with such takedown requests to limit their liability and this has a chilling effect on free speech and expression of all users. Rule 4(2) requires significant social media intermediaries which provide messaging services (such as Whatsapp) to enable identification of the “first originator” of a message. To implement this rule, entities will have to “fingerprint” each message and this may defeat end-to-end encryption. As a consequence, privacy of every user will be compromised to investigate crimes committed by a miniscule-minority. Rule 4(4) requires significant social media intermediaries to develop automated tools to censor content. While the efficacy of such tools is itself doubtful, intermediaries will collect large amounts of data of users to develop these tools in violation of the Right to Privacy of users.  Part III of the Rules will have grave consequences for the freedom of speech and expression of Digital News Media and OTT Platforms, and the right of citizens to have access to information:\n The Rules establish a Code of Ethics which is enforced by an Inter-Departmental Committee which consists only of officers of the Government. The Inter-Departmental Committee may recommend the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to block, delete or modify content published by Digital News Media and OTT platforms. Thus, the Central Government is now the sole arbiter of permissible speech. This affects the publisher’s Fundamental Right to Expression and the citizen’s right to access differing points of view because publishers will be compelled to only produce content which is palatable to the Central Government Notably, Rule 14(1)(b) r/w Rule 14(1)(6) permits the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to refer complaints to an Inter-Departmental Committee and also decide upon those complaints after taking into consideration the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee. This is arbitrary as the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting becomes a ‘judge in its own cause’, and has a chilling effect on speech of the publishers. The Code of Ethics mandates OTT Platforms to “take into consideration India’s multi-racial and multi-religious context” and exercise “due caution” when portraying any racial or religious group. If they do not exercise “due caution” their content may be blocked by the Inter-Departmental Committee. This obligation on OTT Platforms is vague and has a “chilling effect” because vague laws by their very nature, are overbroad and cover within their ambit both unlawful and legitimate speech.  Alternative regulatory visions Firstly, the proper legislative mandate for the IT Act is to focus on online interactions by information conduits that work with user generated content. Hence, the Rules must also be examined in the context of other regulatory paradigms for intermediary liability that integrate digital rights.\nInternational bodies and policy experts have called for the adoption of the ‘Manilla Principles for Intermediary Liability’ to protect online freedom of expression and innovation around the world. These principles are:\n Principle 1: Intermediaries should be shielded by law from liability for third party content Principle 2: Content must not be required to be restricted without an order by a judicial authority Principle 3: Requests for restrictions of content must be clear, be unambiguous, and follow due process Principle 4: Laws and content restriction orders and practices must comply with the tests of necessity and proportionality Principle 5: Laws and content restriction policies and practices must respect due process Principle 6: Transparency and accountability must be built into laws and content restriction policies and practices  The Manilla Principles attempt to provide for an intermediary liability regime that respects human rights, and so it is disappointing that, apart from arguably principle 2, the Rules do not incorporate the principles in its provisions, especially with respect to compliance with proportionality tests. Such disappointment is greater in light of the fact that the Intermediary Guidelines (Amendment) Rules, 2018, had also been criticised for “large unalignment” with the Principles, and so the Rules had represented a chance to right these earlier mistakes.\nAnother regulatory framework that has not been fully engaged with is the ‘Santa Clara Principles’, which state that:\n Principle 1: Companies should publish the numbers of posts removed and accounts permanently or temporarily suspended due to violations of their content guidelines. Principle 2: Companies should provide notice to each user whose content is taken down or account is suspended about the reason for the removal or suspension. Principle 3: Companies should provide a meaningful opportunity for timely appeal of any content removal or account suspension.  We commend the incorporation of principles 1 and 2, through the provision of the aforementioned counter-notices under Rule 4(8)(a) and the requirement for intermediaries to publish periodic compliance reports under Rules 4(d) and 18(3) respectively. However, principle 3 has not been incorporated, as the grievance redressal mechanism specified by the Rules involves contracted timelines for responding and may lead to self-censorship.\nWhat should be done While we understand the need for robust regulations and acknowledge the existence of certain progressive provisions, on the whole, the Rules are undemocratic, unconstitutional, and regressive. This is not to say social media is perfect – on the contrary it is broken. It requires large scale reforms that need to be conducted with transparency towards establishing a statutory framework that safeguards every day, ordinary Indians who use social media with increased frequency in every aspect of their lives.\nWe believe for this to happen the Rules must be withdrawn, and energy should be focussed towards extensive consultations that can lead to a statutory basis for instilling regulation that focuses on transparency and accountability from social media companies. The Rules today run the risk of becoming ‘shotgun legislation’: quick, sudden, and without precision towards addressing an issue with a targeted intervention, something which can only have a disproportionately stifling effect on the digital rights of Indian citizens.\nImportant Documents  Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (link).

In light of concerns about the Information Technology Rules, 2021, we wrote to the Committee, detailing the list of issues and recommendations we have and asking the Committee to put the same before the representatives of the ministries.\nBackground The Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 were notified on February 25th, 2021. The Rules lay down a new and stringent framework for the regulation of online content. Though categorised as ‘soft-touch’, the Rules contain provisions that range from the claustrophobic to the downright stifling, with several implications for free speech, journalistic freedom, and artistic creativity. That these Rules have been notified in the aftermath of the debacle involving Twitter and the Government of India has only exacerbated concerns that they are an attempt to clamp down on dissent. We have written extensively about the Rules before through our deep dive into the Rules as well as our more historical and contextual analysis. We have also provided an explainer on the Self-regulatory Code of the Internet and Mobile Association of India to provide an instance of how self-censorship would work under the Rules.\nThe deleterious effects of these Rules can already be seen: two journalists from Manipur, who have been hounded for their work by the police before, were served a notice under the new Rules, asking them to furnish details attesting to their compliance with the new Rules. Though the notice was subsequently retracted, this incident may be a precursor to future such events in which journalists are intimidated and harangued in such a manner. Meanwhile, self-regulation has already given way to self-censorship for OTT platforms, with on-demand video streaming platforms already exercising caution and discretion. Several completed TV shows and movies have already been cancelled for fear of government censure.\nNow, the list of subjects under consideration of the Committee includes both ‘Citizens data security and privacy' and ‘Ethical standards in media coverage’, two subjects which will be directly impacted by these Rules. Additionally, the agenda for the Committee lists upcoming meetings with representatives of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, on the issues of ‘Review of functioning of Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC)’ and ‘Review of Cyber Security Scenario in India’. Thus, through the letter, we wanted to provide the Committee with an illustrative list of concerns and questions that may be put before the representatives of the Ministries. We describe these issues and the recommendations thereof in detail below.\nProvisions and Issues The Rules consist of three parts. Part I of the Rules is preliminary and provides definitions. Part II empowers the Government to exercise control over intermediaries such as Facebook, Twitter, Google and Whatsapp. Lastly, Part III regulates publishers of news and current affairs (“Digital News Media”) and publishers of online curated content (“OTT platforms”).\nWe believe that the Government should not have notified these far-reaching rules without parliamentary approval and the Rules should have been placed before the Hon’ble Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology. In law, a rule-making authority must not traverse beyond the powers conferred by the Parliament. In this case, the Central Government has notified the Rules under Section 87 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which does not permit the Central Government to regulate Digital News Media and OTT Platforms.\nWhile, in general we do not dispute the need to regulate the internet, the Rules raise grave civil liberty concerns. Part II of the Rules has serious implications on the freedom of speech and expression and the right to privacy of users of the internet:\n Rules 3(1)(b) and 3(1)(c) permit social media intermediaries (such as Facebook) to decide whether any content uploaded by a user violates any law in force and if it does, the entity can terminate the access or usage rights of the user. This enables private entities such as Facebook, to be an arbiter of permissible speech and is in violation of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India. In that case, the Court held that intermediaries cannot decide permissibility of any content without an order of a court or an order by the Government. Rule 3(2) requires social media intermediaries to establish a grievance redressal mechanism by which users may complain against any content and a grievance officer has to dispose of such complaints within 15 days. An empirical study conducted by the Centre for Internet Society points out that intermediaries tend to over-comply with such takedown requests to limit their liability and this has a chilling effect on free speech and expression of all users. Rule 4(2) requires significant social media intermediaries which provide messaging services (such as Whatsapp) to enable identification of the “first originator” of a message. To implement this rule, entities will have to “fingerprint” each message and this may defeat end-to-end encryption. As a consequence, privacy of every user will be compromised to investigate crimes committed by a miniscule-minority. Rule 4(4) requires significant social media intermediaries to develop automated tools to censor content. While the efficacy of such tools is itself doubtful, intermediaries will collect large amounts of data of users to develop these tools in violation of the Right to Privacy of users.  Part III of the Rules has serious implications on freedom of speech and expression of Digital News Media and OTT Platforms, and the right of citizens to have access to information:\n The Rules establish a Code of Ethics which is enforced by an Inter-Departmental Committee which consists only of officers of the Government. The Inter-Departmental Committee may recommend the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to block, delete or modify content published by Digital News Media and OTT platforms. Thus, the Central Government is now the sole arbiter of permissible speech. This affects the publisher’s Fundamental Right to Expression and the citizen’s right to access differing points of view because publishers will be compelled to only produce content which is palatable to the Central Government Notably, Rule 14(1)(b) r/w Rule 14(1)(6) permits the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to refer complaints to an Inter-Departmental Committee and also decide upon those complaints after taking into consideration the recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Committee. This is arbitrary as the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting becomes a ‘judge in its own cause’, and has a chilling effect on speech of the publishers. The Code of Ethics mandates OTT Platforms to “take into consideration India’s multi-racial and multi-religious context” and exercise “due caution” when portraying any racial or religious group. If they do not exercise “due caution” their content may be blocked by the Inter-Departmental Committee. This obligation on OTT Platforms is vague and has a “chilling effect” because vague laws by their very nature, are overbroad and cover within their ambit both unlawful and legitimate speech.  What can be done? The above mentioned issues deserve further scrutiny, and so we request firstly that these Rules be denotified and put through the public consultation process in line with the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy adopted on February 5th, 2014. Given the significant and wide-ranging implications of these Rules, we believe the government must first publish a white paper underlining the government’s intent with respect to intermediary liability and online content regulation. To this extent, we believe the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology must revive the erstwhile Cyber Regulations Advisory Committee under Section 88 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Furthermore, we request that the Committee contain an adequate amount of representation from experts, academics, technologists and civil society organisations. We stress this aspect only because earlier constitutions of the committee witnessed low amounts of participation from the aforementioned groups.\nWe further ask that any future version of the Rules substantially engage with the recommendations put forth by the Standing Committee on Subordinate Legislation’s report on the The Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011, which too had recommended making the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee functional again. These recommendation also included:\n Removing any definitional vagueness to prevent misuse Providing procedural safeguards for content takedown orders Such provisions would provide a basic level of operational transparency, and as such constitute a minimum requirement for any forthcoming regulatory framework.  The regulatory paradigm for digital news media and OTT platforms has also raised grave cause for concern. We believe that here that the first point of departure must be the principles laid down in the report of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s Report of the Committee of Experts chaired by Shyam Benegal that recommended broad guidelines/procedures for certification of films by the central board of film certification. The report of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s Expert Committee on Film Certification recommended a more liberalised regime even for film certification, arguing that the Central Board of Film Certification should not act as a ‘moral compass’, and instead limit itself purely to certification (and not dictate modifications and withdrawals).\nThe committee also stated that film viewing is a consensual act, and so regulation should limit itself to a statutory warning, noting that the artistic expression and creative freedom of filmmakers should be protected and any certification should be responsive to social change. Such arguments apply even more to the realm of online content, where the viewer directly chooses the content they wish to consume. Thus, we believe that the Ministry must put the findings of the Committee of the public consultation process, and ensure that its recommendations are implemented in the next version of the Rules.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s letter to the Standing Committee regarding the Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (link) The Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (link) Latest Draft Intermediary Rules: Fixing big tech, by breaking our digital rights? dated February 25th, 2021 (link) Deep dive : How the intermediaries rules are anti-democratic and unconstitutional dated February 27th, 2021 (link) Coming to streaming services near you: Self-censorship! dated March 4th, 2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/constitutional-questions-against-unconstitutional-rules/","summary":"In light of concerns about the Information Technology Rules, 2021, we wrote to the Standing Committee on IT, detailing issues and recommendations we have and asking the Committee to put the same before the representatives of the ministries.","title":"Constitutional questions against unconstitutional Rules"},{"content":"  Tl;dr In a major victory for online publishers of legal news and literature, today the Kerala High Court restrained coercive action on the operation of Part III of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the “Intermediary Rules 2021”) to LiveLaw Media Pvt. Ltd. in a writ petition filed by LiveLaw Media Pvt. Ltd., M. A. Rashid and Manu Sebastian. The petition comprehensively challenged the Intermediary Rules 2021, framed under the Information Technology Act, 2000 (the “IT Act”).\nBackground On February 25, 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting released the Intermediary Rules 2021, which seek to increase the government control and regulation over social media intermediaries and the content that is posted on such intermediaries. The Intermediary Rules 2021 also seek to bring OTT platforms and digital news media platforms under the purview of the IT Act, under Part III thereof. Read our deep dive analysis of the Intermediary Rules 2021 here, where we explain how the Rules are unconstitutional, undemocratic, and how fundamentally they will change the internet usage experience.\nLiveLaw Media Pvt. Ltd., which owns and operates the legal news portal, and courtroom live update service, LiveLaw.in, filed a writ petition in the Kerala High Court challenging the Intermediary Rules 2021 on the following, among other, grounds: First, the Intermediary Rules 2021 are ultra vires the IT Act; and second, they overrule the effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v Union of India **** which provided immunity to intermediaries and laid down the procedure in respect of ‘content takedown’ orders. The writ petition also argues that the Intermediary Rules 2021 violate the fundamental right to freedom of speech, expression and access to information under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, violate the fundamental right to freedom of profession, business, trade and occupation under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, and violate the fundamental right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.\nLiveLaw Media’s writ petition is a comprehensive petition in relation to the Intermediary Rules 2021 and challenges all aspects of the Rules, including the application of such Rules to social media platforms, OTT platforms and digital news media platforms, and the users thereof.\nThe Intermediary Rules 2021 have also been challenged before the Delhi High Court by the Foundation for Independent Journalism, whose petition came up for hearing before a bench led by the Hon’ble Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court on March 9, 2021. This challenge was limited only to the application of the Intermediary Rules 2021 to digital news media, and does not deal with social media, OTT platforms or the rights of the users of such platforms. The Petitioner in this petition challenged the vires of the Rules, and submitted that the purport of the IT Act is to recognise and facilitate e-commerce, not to regulate content of digital media etc., and in fact the IT Act doesn’t even recognise newspaper entities. The Delhi High Court was pleased to issue notice in the matter, provided time to the government to file its counter affidavit and posted the matter for next hearing on April 16, 2021.\nProceedings before the Kerala High Court LiveLaw Media’s Writ Petition, which is a comprehensive challenge in respect of all provisions of the Intermediary Rules 2021 as described above, was filed on March 9, 2021, by a team led by Advocate Santhosh Mathew and consisting of Advocate Anil Sebastian Pulickel. The Internet Freedom Foundation provided legal assistance in the drafting and filing of the petition through Advocates Vrinda Bhandari, Gautam Bhatia, Karan Lahiri, Abhinav Sekhri, Sanjana Srikumar, N Sai Vinod, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay, Tanmay Singh and Krishnesh Bapat. The Writ Petition came up for its first hearing on the next day, i.e. March 10, 2021, before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Asha of the Kerala High Court.\nMr. Mathew advanced oral arguments on behalf of Live Law and drew the Court’s attention to the provisions of the IT Act, under which the Intermediary Rules 2021 have been purported to be made, and highlighted that there is no provision of the IT Act which allows the regulation of digital news media, by the issuance of such Rules.\nHe argued that someone may write an article containing certain opinions, or LiveLaw may report a judgment, which contains certain remarks, which may not be palatable to a particular reader. Any such reader may consider themselves aggrieved by such content, and file a grievance with LiveLaw, and LiveLaw will then have to sit in judgment over such content. If LiveLaw does not remove such content, the self-regulatory body appointed subject to the Central Government’s approval will judge the suitability of such content, and on the third level, the Central Government itself shall decide whether to remove such content. This entire process takes place even though the parent Act of the Intermediary Rules 2021, i.e. the IT Act does not even apply to news media, since the IT Act applies to intermediaries, and news media are not intermediaries.\nIn response, the government claimed that the power to govern news media under the IT Act arises from S.69B of the IT Act, and suggested that LiveLaw may not even be considered as news media, insofar as it reports court judgments, however, any commentary offered on such judgments may be covered under ‘news media’.\nMr. Mathew, counsel for the petitioners, submitted that LiveLaw does not intend to register itself with the ministry within 30 days, as required by Rule 12(3) of the Intermediary Rules 2021, or constitute the self-regulatory body at all since such requirements of the Rules are outside the scope of S.69A of the IT Act. He pointed out that there may be complaints against LiveLaw in the meantime and there would be an obligation to provide a reply within 24 hours and resolve the grievance within 15 days and, thus, the Petitioners require interim protection. He clarified that LiveLaw was not shirking its responsibilities under any law, rules, regulations or guidelines applicable to it, but that the Intermediary Rules 2021 are not applicable to it.\nDirections Issued by the Kerala High Court The High Court of Kerala was pleased to admit the matter for hearing, and restrained coercive action of the operation of Part III of the Intermediary Rules 2021 as applied to the Petitioners. Part III of the Rules relates to digital news media, and requires publishers of digital news media to establish a grievance procedure, appoint a grievance officer, establish a self-regulatory body, register itself with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and adhere to the Code of Ethics provided in the Appendix.\nThis is a significant victory for the publishers of judgments and legal records, and will provide relief to the Petitioners against any coercive action until the writ petition is finally decided. We thank Live Law for giving us an opportunity to lend our expertise in this important case and are deeply grateful to all the lawyers who worked on this petition and especially Mr. Santhosh Mathew who led the legal team.\nImportant Links  Writ Petition filed on behalf of LiveLaw Media Pvt.

This provides adequate time to reflect and examine its efficacy. What we have found is worrying. There is little, to no public data nor evidence on it\u0026rsquo;s tangible benefits. On the contrary many of its flaws are well documented. By an objective analysis we hope to document not only the impact of Aarogya Setu on user privacy and informational privacy but also any intended benefits it may have offered. This may help a model of technology deployment that is focussed in a rights respecting manner, centred in legality and directed towards outcomes rather than coercion and surveillance.\n  Looking Back Even early on, voices were being raised against the blanket imposition of the app. On May 1st, 2020, 45 organisations and more than 100 prominent individuals sent a joint representation to the Prime Minister’s office, arguing against the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu, citing issues of consent, privacy, algorithmic accountability, and the risk of function creep. This led to the usage of Aarogya Setu now being on a ‘best effort basis’. However, the fight did not stop here: several other governments and administrations at the local level mandated the use of Aarogya Setu, such as the Noida Authorities, the Delhi courts, and Delhi wholesale liquor vendors, all of which required contestation. We also discussed how RWAs may be going well beyond their legally defined functions by mandating the use of Aarogya Setu by residents and visitors including domestic workers, drivers, delivery personnel and other service providers.\nLastly, through our strategic litigation, we were also able to file petitions in the Kerala High Court regarding the mandatory usage of Aarogya Setu to the point of criminal penalties, as well as the app’s third party data sharing protocols.\n  Issues and Efficacy In April last year, IFF released a working paper on covid surveillance and privacy in India. A section of the working paper analysed several contact tracing apps, including Aarogya Setu. We detailed several vulnerabilities with respect to privacy, information sharing, and data maximisation in the app, while also questioning its usefulness and accuracy at a more fundamental level. We also noted concerns about how the app could become part of a permanent system of surveillance, especially since there was no defined period for data retention and deletion.\nWhen the Standing Committee on IT was actively considering issues related to ‘citizens data security and privacy’, we wrote to the Committee highlighting the three key concerns of the impact on privacy, the lack of a legislative framework, and the threat of mass surveillance and exclusion. After rising public pressure, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology finally released the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 on May 11th, 2020. However, we thoroughly analysed the protocol to show that it failed to satisfy the basic threshold of legality. This was based on the several issues:\n Fundamentally, the Protocol has no statutory backing Violation of the proportionality principle through expansive definitions Implementation concerns and the threat of function creep Lack of meaningful incorporation of the principles of necessity and proportionality Excessive collection, processing, storage, and even sharing of personal data An utterly insufficient sunset clause for the protocol  A general lack of transparency pervades the Aarogya Setu ‘ecosystem’, and this can be seen in several contexts. RTI responses to questions about the app generally failed to receive adequate answers. We also had to send a legal notice to the Central Information Commission regarding their refusal to let RTI activist Saurav Das attend the show cause hearing in his complaint which seeks action against government officials who claim to have no information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app. The Delhi High Court also issued a notice to the Public Information Officers of several ministries in this matter. To address this lack of transparency and accountability, we released the minutes of the meetings of the 9th Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management (received through an RTI) which provided an inside view into the creation and explanation of Aarogya Setu.\n  Issues have also been raised about the non open-source nature of the app. Even when the source code was released, it was the code for an earlier version of the app that was made available. Furthermore, the server-side code of the app was not available at all!\nMeanwhile, the benefits of Aarogya Setu remain unclear. Firstly, with 11.2 million cases and growing as of March 5th, 2021, the diseases can hardly be said to have been contained, especially since the daily caseload peaked in September - long after the introduction of the app. The Central government itself has apologised for opaque and “irresponsible” behaviour with respect to the app. Its accuracy has also been said to be less than stellar. Indeed, the app has been found unable to pick up details about people on “two sides of a shopping mall or even on two sides of a wall”. Experts have also pointed out the weakness of Bluetooth technology with regards to contact tracing, while cyber security professionals have demonstrated persistent vulnerabilities in the app. There has been criticism of the privacy paradigm from a technical perspective as well: unlike other contact tracing applications, Arogya Setu uses a static identifier (thus reducing the potential for anonymity), while the application also collects significantly more metadata. These measures create large privacy concerns and leave the app vulnerable to attacks.\n  Additionally, even those who argue for the app note that direct contact tracing methods have been found to be more effective. Furthermore, while the NITI Aayog may have trumpeted the usefulness of the app by pointing out to its prediction of emerging hotspots, the incidence of false positives (through overestimation of risk across large distances surfaces) and indeed even false negatives (through weakened radio signals) cannot be discounted. The failure to provide risk intervals, a standard practice across all scientific endeavours, makes questions about accuracy even more pressing.\nTo address concerns about its efficacy, the government said that positivity rate of the application was 27%, more than three times the national average of 8%. While this may look good on paper, it must be noted that such overestimation is not harmless. Such a broad testing interval may disproportionately increase the load on India\u0026rsquo;s creaking testing infrastructure. Moreover, when such significant harms to citizens' privacy is being made, such laxity cannot simply be \u0026lsquo;press-conferenced\u0026rsquo; away.\n  What does the future hold? As if this menagerie of serious problems is not enough, the scope of Aarogya Setu has now been further expanded: from its origin as a contact tracing app, Aarogya Setu is now going to be used in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout programme. Vaccination certificates will also be digitally available on the app. Our fears have been confirmed: Aarogya Setu is likely going to become a permanent part of our health data landscape. With its integration with the CoWIN platform, we are going to witness the further consolidation of personal information datasets that can be used for passive surveillance and may lead to large scale exclusion.\nThis is why we have written to the National Informatics Centre, pointing out that issues with Aarogya Setu have still not been addressed and asking for information on the following issues:\n Whether the government plans to phase out Arogya Setu or retain it as a part fo the health data landscape' Whether the data of inactive users is being deleted under the Protocol; Whether the data of users for whom the 180 day period has passed been permanently deleted; Whether the processing of contact, location, and self-assessment data is bundled together or whether they follow separate timelines; Whether the data of those who have requested the deletion of their demographic data has been deleted; Whether an audit has been conducted to check whether data taken from the the Arogya Setu database has been deleted;  Important Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s letter to the National Informatics Centre regarding the storage of Arogya Setu data (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/the-past-and-future-of-aarogya-setu/","summary":"We are close to a year since the launch of Arogya Setu.

To us, while this may not cleanly fit within the present framework, it poses tremendous challenges to artistic expression and diversity ultimately ceding control to Government mandated censorship.\n  Tl;dr In light of the recently notified Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, we decided to provide an explainer on the Internet and Mobile Association of India\u0026rsquo;s toolkit on the implementation of their Code on self-regulation for Online Curated Content providers. In our explainer, we describe the grievance redressal structure proposed by the toolkit, analyse some of the concerns at hand, and explain how the toolkit will enmesh with the Rules.\nContext On February 25th, 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (the “Intermediary Rules”). Arguably unconstitutional in their approach, The Intermediary Rules mandate a 3-tier grievance redressal which effectively provides for self censorship of online video streaming platforms, as we have analysed in our last post. A vision of how this would look when operationalised has already been offered up to us through the Self-Regulation Code of Online Curated Content Providers (the, \u0026ldquo;Code\u0026rdquo;) of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). IAMAI has also come up with a toolkit (prior to the IT Rules were announced) for implementing the Code.\nWe believe that this form of self regulation will lead to large amounts of self-censorship, given that it will integrate with the oversight function played by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The Self Regulatory Code as made by the IAMAI will need to see changes for it to be brought in line with the fresh requirements with The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.\nWhat is the toolkit? In the context of discussions taking place last year in relation to OTT platforms and their regulation, OTT providers among themselves, under the aegis of the IAMAI, released their own Self-Regulation Code of Online Curated Content Providers (the Code), as far back as September 4th, 2020. The Code aims to, amongst other things,: a) protect the interests of consumers and empower them to make informed choices about content, b) nurture creativity and foster innovation, c) preserve independence of the economy, and d) provide consumers with a mechanism for grievance redressal.\nIn order to help implement the Code, on February 12th, 2021, i.e., approximately two weeks before the Intermediaries Rules were notified, 17 OTT service providers, under the aegis of the IAMAI, had released a toolkit in respect of the Code. The toolkit recommends the formation of the following bodies\nThe toolkit recommends the formation of the following bodies:\n IAMAI Secretariat: In consultation with the signatories, the IAMAI shall constitute a secretariat. It shall be composed of representatives from the IAMAI and the signatories, along with any other staff that may be deemed necessary; Advisory Panel: Each signatory shall constitute an Advisory Panel to look into complaints when the complainant either is dissatisfied with the decision of the Internal Committee or requests an escalation of a complaint filed with the consumer complaints department of a signatory or the grievance committee proposed by the Code  The powers and responsibilities of the secretariat shall include: a) to provide assistance towards compliance with the Code, b) to develop a process to seek information from signatories about their progress towards compliance, c) to plan and implement consumer awareness programs, and d) to review and update the toolkit periodically.\nThe toolkit notes that the signatories have agreed to adhere to all applicable laws (see appendix). Signatories must create educational materials for helping their staff learn about compliance and subsequently hold extensive training sessions. Signatories must also take certain steps to improve consumer awareness, such as creating and publishing videos about measures taken in compliance with the Code. Signatories must conduct audits and code compliance reviews each year. Within one year of becoming a signatory, each signatory must submit a self-declaration of compliance to the Secretariat.\nWhat are its legislative and policy origins?    Document Recommendations/provisions     Self-Regulation Code of Online Curated Content Providers Regulatory basis for the toolkit; lays down guidelines for age classification, content descriptions, and access controls; provides three-tiered grievance redressal system    What are the proposed objectives of the toolkit? The stated objectives of the toolkit are:\n Set out the guiding principles and code of ethics for the reference of the signatories; Provide for procedures to effectuate the various provisions of the Code; Assist the signatories in fulfilling their commitments and responsibilities as set out in the Code; Achieve effective self-regulation goals as envisioned by the Signatories in the Code.  Amit Goenka, the Chairman of the Digital Entertainment Committee of the IAMAI, said that the toolkit is an indication of the commitment of online curated content providers towards augmenting consumer empowerment and creative excellence in the Indian entertainment industry.\nWhat is public opinion on the issue? The Confederation of Indian Industry has welcomed the toolkit and asked the government to support and endorse it, stating that, “the industry is mature and responsible enough to keep necessary guidelines in mind while creating content”. The Asia Video Industry Association has also welcomed the move, calling the toolkit a useful and important addition to the Indian governance system for Online Curated Content”. However, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was not be satisfied with the toolkit, as indicated by reports that the Ministry was considering guidelines for regulating over-the-top platforms. This came to head with the Intermediary Rules which went beyond the Code and this Toolkit.\nAfter the notification of the Intermediary Rules, the president of the IAMAI has stated that the IAMAI welcomed the Intermediary Rules. However, reports have also emerged many OTT platforms are still discussing their responses Rules, with IAMAI collating feedback from industry players on the basis of which a future plan of action shall be devised. The platforms also debated nominating the IAMAI as the self-regulatory body for OTT platforms.\nSelf-censorship and applicability An immediate issue is whether the Centre accepted such a model? Answers to Lok Sabha questions reveal that the Ministry felt that the Code, “did not give adequate cognizance to content prohibited under law and there were issues of conflict of interest”. The Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Prakash Javadekar, also explicitly stated that OTT guidelines will soon be implemented, as they soon were. With the notification of the Intermediary Rules, certain provisions of the Toolkit may indeed be retained, however, both the Code and the toolkit will require revision to harmonise with the Rules.\nThe most important issue is whether the adoption of the Code and the toolkit is a step along the road to self censorship. Even more so in the aftermath of the Intermediary Rules, 2021, the Code is similar to the cable tv model of self-censorship. Through the standards and practices formulated and adopted by the secretariat, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting will be able to exercise indirect control over content. The yearly audits will provide the Ministry with a further level of oversight over content creators and platforms. Furthermore, under the Code, online content curators will have to maintain a record of each complaint disposed of for two years from the date of disposal, making the threat of ‘inspection’ by the Ministry loom large..\nThe Rules go beyond the Code by recommending an inter-departmental committee as the third tier of the grievance redressal mechanism, which consists of representatives from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Law and Justice, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Defence, etc. This Committee will hear complaints about any decisions taken at the previous two levels, and it will have the power to modify or delete content for “preventing incitement to the commission of a cognisable offence relating to public order”.\nThis essentially allows the inter-departmental committee a ‘veto-power’ over any content that may be produced. The net effect will be a heavily censored content ecosystem, resulting from both increased self-censorship due to the threat of action being taken as well as the top-down dictats of either the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting or the inter-departmental committee. The Rules also provide the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting with the power to administer OTT platforms. Given that the Rules also suffer from an excessive delegation of powers, a significant level of arbitrariness will now pervade the regulatory landscape, to be exercised at the discretion of the Ministry. More on this below.\nCable TV style regulation The move towards the adoption of certification based standards and practices à la cable TV regulation incorrectly conflates online video streaming with TV watching. The private nature of online content viewing, where viewer choice is paramount, should imply a different level of oversight than is applied to cable television (and the effect of this regulation is apparent from the stultifying content that generally appears on TV screens). Additionally, the categorisations prescribed by the Code will be drafted and operationalised on the basis of the laws listed in the toolkit, which are themselves extremely vague and allow significant amounts of arbitrariness (especially with classifiers such as ‘seditious’ and ‘obscene content’).\nIndeed, the report of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s Expert Committee on Film Certification recommended a more liberalised regime even for film certification, arguing that the Central Board of Film Certification should not act as a ‘moral compass’, and instead limit itself purely to certification (and not dictate modifications and withdrawals). The committee also stated that film viewing is a consensual act, and so regulation should limit itself to a statutory warning, noting that the artistic expression and creative freedom of filmmakers should be protected and any certification should be responsive to social change. Such arguments apply even more to the realm of online content, where the viewer directly chooses the content they wish to consume.\nLegal and economic considerations The chilling effect that such self-censorship would have would be equivalent to pre-censorship by the Ministry. Similar sentiments have been voiced in the judicial system as well. In Gajanan P. Lasure \u0026amp; Anr. vs The Central Board Of Film Certification, the Supreme Court had noted that the unconstitutional restriction or withdrawal of content would be, “tantamount to negation of the rule of law and a surrender to black mail and intimidation” (here the Supreme Court was referring to the protests against the movie Aarakshan), and that it was the, “the duty of the State to protect the freedom of expression since it is a liberty guaranteed against the State''.\nSuch regulatory models also have other consequences. Contemporary India is a large producer of high quality video content that is watched all over the world. Indeed, it actively competes with other established giants such as the United States of America and South Korea in the field of entertainment. Such a status may be significantly harmed by the imposition of a harsh regulatory environment. Economic effects may also be felt, as the industry generates a large amount of revenue and employment, and is projected to grow at 21.8% per year over the period 2018-2023.\nSelf-regulation and the intermediary rules The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 have, in the Appendix to the Rules defined a “Code Of Ethics And Procedure And Safeguards In Relation To Digital/Online Media” which shall apply on “applicable entities”. “Applicable entities” as contained in Rule 7 include, “publishers of news and current affairs content”; and “intermediaries which primarily enable the transmission of news and current affairs content”; and “publishers of online curated content”; and, “intermediaries which primarily enable the transmission of online curated content.”\nFurther, under sub-rule (3) of Rule 8, the Rules lay down a three-tier structure for observance and adherence to the Code which is as follows, “Level I - Self-regulation by the applicable entity”; “Level II - Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the applicable entities”; “Level III - Oversight mechanism by the Central Government.” This oversight mechanism is being created without any clear legislative backing and will now increasingly perform functions similar to those played by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for TV regulation. For instance, as per Rule 13(4) this also now includes powers of censorship such as apology scrolls, but also blocking of content!\nAll of this is being planned to be done without any legislative backing or a clear law made by parliament. It is also patently clear that the provisions of the Code will harmonise with the clauses of the Rules: for example, the IAMAI secretariat is precisely the sort of self-regulating body prescribed by the Code, except with the addition of even more Ministry oversight and an adjudicatory function it will have to play. In conclusion, there are large threats to creativity and diversity which flow from not only the MIB\u0026rsquo;s oversight but also the self-regulatory systems being put in place to operationalise the Intermediary Rules.\n  Recommendations In light of the above, here are a few suggestions to address these issues:\n Withdrawal of Rules, Code, and Toolkit: Existing Acts provide the government with sufficient power to address inflammatory content, and so the status quo ante must be preserved (at the very least). Furthermore, as we have explained earlier, the Intermediaries Rules are unconstitutional and so deserve to be recalled. A comprehensive public consultation must also be held before any further versions of the Rules are notified. Since the Self-regulatory code and the toolkit both follow the Rules in spirit, the IAMAI must roll back both of them, and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting must not endorse the Code. Public consultation on Expert Committee: The findings of the Expert Committee must be put through the public consultation process so that the suitable changes can be made to all the regulatory frameworks. Emancipatory framework for online content: Online content needs to be given the space to grow, and should not stifled by regressive societal mores and a paranoid government. Thus, an expansive framework for online content must be mandated that allows the creativity of content creators to thrive.  Given the attendant concerns that arise from the above, we requested the Ministry to publish a full consultation timeline over any potential amendments in line with several health precedents for public consultations set in the past.\nPresently, no such timeline exists, while the Standing Committee on Information Technology also does not seem to be considering this issue (it does not seem to be in the list of subjects or in the list of sittings - see here). Furthermore, we ask that extensive dialogues be conducted with academics, civil society, digital rights experts and organisations, and technologists, as such groups would provide a unique citizen-centred perspective that would complement the more business or administration friendly inputs of other stakeholders.\nImportant Documents  IAMAI\u0026rsquo;s Self-Regulatory toolkit Explainer (link) IAMAI\u0026rsquo;s Implementation toolkit to Self-regulation Code (link) IAMAI\u0026rsquo;s Self-Regulation Code of Online Curated Content Providers (link) Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology\u0026rsquo;s Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/self-censorship-and-the-end-of-good-content/","summary":"In light of the recently notified Intermediary Rules, we have made an explainer on the IAMAI\u0026rsquo;s toolkit for the self-regulation code for OCC providers.

In our letter, we highlighted our concerns regarding privacy and surveillance, and asked that the Bill be redrafted.\nContext On February 3rd, 2021, the Standing Committee submitted its report on the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 to Parliament. Along with the report were two dissent notes filed by the honourable members MP Asaddudin Owaisi and MP Benoy Viswam. Both dissent notes detailed concerns that had not been adequately addressed, including certain issues the Committee had itself acknowledged.\nThe sensitive nature of DNA data necessitates extreme caution with regards to the large scale processing of data, and thus we believe that such concerns cannot be effectively disregarded. To this end, we had made an explainer on the Report, analysing both the Bill and the recommendations to the Committee. We also wrote to the MPs who had filed dissent notes, thanking them for pointing out the issues with the Bill.\nReliability, privacy, and data protection One of the key issues is the nature of DNA technology itself. The use of DNA samples to determine culpability has faced questions over its effectiveness - while its usefulness has been acknowledged, the unrestricted use of DNA as incontrovertible (due to notions of its infallibility) has been criticised as unscientific. In Jitendra v. State of MP, the Madhya Pradesh High Court admitted the casual nature of DNA based inferences and did not acknowledge the presence of DNA material as direct evidence of culpability. Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Committee as well, a significant lack of capacity pervades the india DNA technology landscape, which further hinders the quality of DNA analysis. This has been acknowledged by the legal system as well, as seen in Rajiv Singh v. State of Bihar where the Supreme Court dismissed improperly analysed DNA evidence.\nAnother important issue is the invasion of privacy. The Supreme Court’s judgement in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors. enshrined the right to privacy as fundamental and provided 5 key standards which would have to be met when affecting the right to privacy: legality, a legitimate state aim, necessary for the specified objective, proportionality, and the existence of procedural safeguards. The DNA profiling of citizens through a DNA data bank may fail these standards, as such a move may disproportionately affect citizens’ right to privacy. This stems from the Bill’s reliance on archaic notions of privacy, given that it was drafted before the Puttaswamy judgement. Indeed, even basic standards of consent may be overridden, as clause 21 of the Bill allows bodily substances to be obtained from a person without consent if the appropriate magistrate believes that analysing said substances may confirm or disprove culpability. Apart from the vaguely worded definitions that confer significant discretionary powers, such provisions constitute a gross violation of an individual’s right to privacy.\nThe absence of a robust data protection law provides further space for the misuses of DNA data by state or potentially even private actors. Standards timelines for data retention have also not been mentioned - existing laws such as the Habitual Offenders Act specify timelines for data collection, retention, and deletion - while no data protection obligations have been explicitly imposed on DNA testing laboratories. Additionally, the majority view of the Committee seems to be that privacy and data security concerns have been adequately addressed: when responding to member Asaddudin Owaisi’s dissent note, the chairman Jairam Ramesh stated that he did not “see the connection” between the DNA bill and the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 since “the Bill deals with as different universe of data”, and that the Data Protection Authority proposed by the latter should not have powers of oversight over the DNA regulatory board.\nDiscretionary powers and capacity building The amount of discretionary powers granted under the Bill have also not been adequately addressed. For example, clause 54 of the Bill allows the government to supersede the board through a simple notification. Such a provision could be misused to increase the scope of powers beyond what may be necessary or proportionate, while also contravening the Supreme Court’s judgement in Dr.Subramanian Swamy vs Director, Cbi \u0026amp; Anr, which clarified that the excessive delegation of legislative powers to a statutory authority would make a law susceptible to being stuck down. Clauses 56 and 57 are similarly extravagant in their granting of powers; the former allows the Centre to amend schedule, thereby allowing it to potentially expand the Bill beyond the scope of its original intention and thus violating the principle of purpose limitation, while the latter bars the operations of the DNA regulatory board from judicial review. Once again, it is disconcerting that the Committee failed to acknowledge such concerns and accepted these clauses without modification.\nThe lack of capacity for operationalising DNA testing infrastructure and conducting widespread training of DNA professionals, prosecutors, and even judges also has a significant cost. The estimates of Rs 20 crore as an initial capital investment plus Rs 5 crore per annum for conducting the relevant activities are quite steep, and indeed likely underestimate the actual cost that would be incurred. In an economy ravaged by the pandemic and with government revenues shrinking, government expenditure may be better directed towards more urgent issues, especially for an endeavour that has faced concerns from several concerns and may significantly infringe upon the privacy of citizens.\nSurveillance and DNA profiling The most dangerous outcome that may result from improper usage of DNA technology is the discriminatory DNA profiling of citizens, as has been admitted by the Committee itself. The nature of DNA data necessitates extreme precautions with respect to its processing, as well as additional safeguards to protect against biases. The very methods of analysis have also been questioned, as the statistical modelling algorithms used in DNA analysis have been found to embed judgements of those who created them. At the very least, such concerns should promote an approach towards DNA testing that does not promote DNA evidence as infallible.\nThis is even more important in the Indian context since, as has been pointed out in the dissent notes filed by the members of the Committee, the Indian justice system disproportionately incarcerates minorities and marginalised communities. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau states that as of September 2020, 16.6% of convicts, 18.7% of undertrials, and 35.8% of detenues are muslim, even though muslims make up only 14.2% of the population. Similarly, 21.7% of convicts, 21% of undertrials, and 18.15% of detenues are dalits, even though dalits make up only 16.6% of the population. The Committee itself mentioned the case of a false encounter in which innocents who were thought to be militants were killed. In such a situation, the use of DNA technologies may lead to the targeting of different segments of society. The use of wide ranging crimes indices, which in the view of some members are unnecessary and possess the potential for abuse, further stokes concerns about group-based profiling. Yet again, despite the concerns raised by members (including the chairman), the Committee recommended the retention of the provision.\nWe advocate for a complete redraft! While it is encouraging that the Committee acknowledged many of these very concerns, it is unfortunate that it recommended keeping such provisions and asked the government to assuage these concerns on the floor of the Parliament. We believe that the honourable Committee should have provided concrete recommendations on all issues it deemed important, since accepting or rejecting the recommendations of the reports will anyways be the prerogative of the government. Furthermore, precedents exist for the redrafting of a bill on the basis of a report by a parliamentary committee. Such a move would be in keeping with our democratic ethos.\nIn light of the above concerns, we ask that the Bill be redrafted. In the first instance, the Bill must be reviewed to ensure that it is consistent with the proportionality standards laid down in the Puttaswamy judgement. The provisions of the Bill must also be harmonised with the relevant provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Both such tasks must be carried by the proposed Data Protection Authority (or any future data authority). The scope of the Bill must also be reduced to preclude the collection of crime scene indices as well as the data of suspects and undertrials, and the allowed uses of DNA data must be restricted. DNA data must also be barred from use in civil proceedings.\nFurthermore, overrides to the obligation of consent must be rethought, while any discretionary powers that may be provided to the government under the Bill must be reduced in scope, and the appropriate provisions must be codified. Finally, a mechanism for providing remedies to those whose data is used in an unlawful way must be specified.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s letter to the Department of Biotechnolgoy regarding the Report of the Standing Committee on the DNA Bill (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s explainer on the DNA Bill Report (link) The Standing Committee\u0026rsquo;s report on The DNA Technology (Use And Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s legislator\u0026rsquo;s brief on the DNA Technology Regulation Bill, 2018 (link) Apar Gupta\u0026rsquo;s written testimony to the Standing Committee\u0026rsquo;s report on The DNA Technology (Use And Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s submissions on the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation, 2019 to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/say-no-to-dna-based-surveillance/","summary":"As a follow up to our analysis and outreach on the Report of the Standing Committee on the DNA Bill, 2019, we have written to the Department of Biotechnology.

Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of February, we have up till now filed 41 RTI requests with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government.\n  Note: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month\u0026rsquo;s report may be included in the present report.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 28 requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:\n Puducherry Police, Haryana Police, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd (IPSCD), Department of Higher Education, Chandigarh Govt., Ongole Municipal Corporation, Telangana State Road Transport Authority, Andhra Pradesh Police, Education Department, Delhi Govt. \u0026amp; Delhi Police  Additionally we also filed requests with:\n The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology on the Draft National Strategy on Blockchain.

Free Speech and Censorship Our other main focus is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the last month, we have filed 13 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Ministry of Home Affairs on the reported internet shutdowns which took place in New Delhi on January 26, 2021. The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology on the reports that multiple twitter accounts have been suspended by Twitter India on February 1, 2021. A follow-up request was also filed with them on this issue. The Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting on any proposed regulations of Over The Top (OTT) platforms that are being drafted by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting on any complaints received against the Amazon web series “Tandav”. The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology, the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited - HQ and the MTNL- Corporate Office on websites, URLs or applications blocked pursuant to any order/decree/judgment passed by a competent court during 2020 and 2021. The Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting and the Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology on a news report titled, Draft govt policy seeks 3-tier checks for OTTs, published in the Hindustan Times dated February 24, 2021.

We provide you with an overview of its contents, the “safeguards” it seeks to establish, how they affect your internet usage experience, and your fundamental rights. Most notably, the Rules now will bring government control rather than regulation over digital news platforms and OTT video content providers. Several requirements under them suffer from unconstitutionality and undermine the free expression and privacy for millions of internet users in India.\nWhat are the Intermediary Rules? In our previous post, we discussed the sketchy history of the Intermediary Rules. We also touched upon an analysis of the draft version, and while there have been some changes between the finalised version, the core of the proposals remain. They massively undermine your privacy and free expression as users of the Internet in India. For a quick explainer on what they are, you can also view a video we made yesterday.\nYesterday evening these rules were notified in the official gazette as the “Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021”. For convenience, let’s just call them the Intermediary Rules. The Intermediary Rules have replaced the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) Rules, 2011 (or the 2011 Rules). In this post, we bring a much more in-depth and legal analysis of the Intermediary Rules breaking down the top 5 changes in each chapter that impact your digital rights.\nWhat is the structure of the Intermediary Rules? While Part I of the Intermediary Rules mainly lays down the definitions of terms, Part II and Part III contain the actual compliances and requirements. Part II deals with the regulation of intermediaries, including social media intermediaries. Social media intermediaries include messaging-related intermediaries, such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, and media-related intermediaries, such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. This part is administered by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).\nPart III deals with the regulation of digital news media (though there is a lack of clarity on exactly which news media these Rules apply to) and OTT platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+Hotstar. Part III is administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.\nBelow we are doing a deeper dive and an initial analysis of the new compliances with brief comments on possible impacts. We invite you to use the comments feature to let us know your thoughts, views, and yes, we do remain open to any and all corrections. We intend to advance a public discussion on these massive changes to our internet freedom which appear to hurt our privacy and free expression tremendously.\nSocial media and messaging related intermediaries 1. Creation of differential obligations: Fresh classes have been created including, “social media intermediary” [Rule 2(w)] and “significant social media intermediary” [Rule 2(v)]. The threshold for social media intermediary to be considered and regulated as a “significant social media intermediary” was notified on February 26, 2021, as fifty lakh (5 million) registered users. These categories bring a high level of government discretion in determining which platforms need to comply with what regulations. Such power is further reinforced by Rule 6, as per which the government may, by order, require any intermediary to comply with obligations imposed on a “significant social media intermediary” under Rule 4. To do so, it must satisfy the threshold of “a material risk of harm”. This threshold is vague, and it enables the Central Government to enforce discriminatory compliances.\n2. Nanny requirement: Do you hate email spam? Do you hate incomprehensible Terms of Service and Privacy Policies even more? Well, get ready for them being delivered more than once a year. Under the new rules, each intermediary will have to notify you at least each year [Rule 3(c)]. This means practically a whole host of web services will send you periodic emails reminding you not to do anything “illegal”, or they will terminate your account.\n3. Grievance redressal mechanism: While in the version in 2011, an intermediary was required to appoint a grievance redressal officer (Rule 11), there are a whole host of compliances now necessary that have been additionally placed. Previously, the Grievance Officer was responsible for receiving complaints from users concerning the Rules and redressing them within a month. Now, the Grievance Officer is responsible for acknowledging complaints within 24 hours and resolving them within a reduced timeline of 15 days [Rule 3(2)(a)(i)]. The Grievance Officer has also been made responsible for the receipt and acknowledgement of any order, notice or direction issued by the appropriate government, any competent authority or a court of competent jurisdiction [Rule 3(2)(a)(ii)]. However, grievance officers for intermediaries other than significant social media intermediaries are not required to furnish reasons for the decision taken regarding complaints received by them. They don’t have to furnish reasons either to the complainant or even to the user whose content may have been removed because of the Intermediary Rules. This is discussed in more detail below.\n4. Significant Social Media Intermediaries get a full grievance redressal team: In addition to the obligations imposed on intermediaries, significant social media intermediaries, which is a distinct class, have an additional requirement to appoint three officers with different responsibilities [Rule 4(1)]. The officers are:\n a Chief Compliance Officer, responsible for ensuring compliance with the Information Technology Act, 2000 (the IT Act) and the rules made thereunder, and liable for proceedings in this regard; a nodal person of contact, for “24x7 coordination” with law enforcement agencies; and a Resident Grievance Officer, with similar responsibilities as the Grievance Officer for intermediaries described above.  A Resident Grievance Officer of a significant social media intermediary is also required to notify a user before removing content posted by such user with reasons, provide them with an opportunity to dispute such action, and give the complainant its reasons for the decision taken in response to their complaint [Rules 4(6)]and 4(8)]. Notably, the grievance officers for other intermediaries do not have such requirements.\nAll three officers appointed by the significant social media intermediaries, as above, are now legally required to reside in India. Significant social media Intermediaries are also required to have a physical contact address in India [Rule 4(5)]. Officer’s details and the physical contact address must be prominently published on its website or mobile-based Internet application. It is important to note that the Home Ministry has fortnightly meetings with all social media entities in India. We may expect this list to grow now, with designated Chief Compliance Officers required to attend them.\n5. Contracted timelines for assistance to law enforcement agencies: The obligation on the intermediaries in the 2011 Rules was to “act within thirty-six hours and where applicable, work with the user or owner of such information” to take it down. Under the new Intermediaries Rules, intermediaries must complete the takedown process under Section 79(3) of the IT Act, within 36 hours. Further, the 2011 Rules did not specify a timeline within which intermediaries were required to provide information or assistance to law enforcement agencies. The Intermediary Rules have provided intermediaries with a 72-hour limit for providing such information or assistance [Rule 3(2)(j)]. Additionally, a new takedown requirement has been added, wherein specific scenarios, such as nudity, depiction of sexual conduct or impersonation, the intermediary is required to take down such content, upon request of the concerned user, within 24 hours [Rule 3(2)(b)].\n**6. **Hello big brother! Expansion of mandatory data retention: **** The data retention period has been doubled, and intermediaries are now required to preserve information for 180 days (6 months!) for investigative purposes [Rule 3(1)(h)]. The data has to be preserved even after a user has deleted their accounts. It is important to consider this requirement in the absence of a data protection law and any kind of oversight on how surveillance operates in India (side note: IFF is a litigant challenging it in the Supreme Court).\n7. “Voluntary” verification of social media users: Significant social media Intermediaries must also allow their users to “voluntarily” verify their accounts, using any appropriate mechanism, including the active Indian mobile number of the user. The significant social media intermediary shall also provide a visible and demonstrable mark identifying such verification [Rule 4(7)]. This could lead to a scenario where the voluntary becomes mandatory, as is the case with many other technologies which were introduced as “voluntary” but eventually made mandatory in an indirect manner. It would then have severe implications for anonymity and privacy (imagine being made to link your Aadhaar to your social media accounts without which government handles may not respond to you!), which are essential for users of social media intermediaries, for example, political dissenters. Also, much more worryingly, without a data protection law, this means that Social Media entities will collect data of our government IDs without any regulatory body, such as a data protection authority, to ensure it is used only for verification.\n8. An end to end-to-end encryption: Significant social media intermediaries must enable tracing of the originator of information on their platform if required by a court of competent jurisdiction or a competent authority under Section 69A of the IT Act [Rule 4(2)]. While the Intermediaries Rules clarify that traceability order may only be passed for serious offences, some categories are open-ended. For instance, “public order” grounds are relatively broad in operation and can give rise to many demands. The Intermediaries Rules also clarify that in doing so, the significant social media intermediary shall not be required to disclose the contents of any electronic message, any other information related to the first originator, or any information related to its other users. However, the Information Technology Decryption Rules contain powers to make demands for the message content. Used together, the government will break any type of end-to-end encryption to gain knowledge of who sent what message and also get to know its contents. Also, this specific requirement will break existing protocols for the deployment of end-to-end encryption that has been built through rigorous cybersecurity testing over the years!\n9. AI automated censorship: Significant social media intermediaries are now also required to develop and deploy technology-based measures. These include automated tools or other mechanisms to proactively identify information that depicts any act or simulation in any form depicting rape, child sexual abuse or conduct [Rule 4(4)]. We have highlighted how even the best effort deployment of such filtering technologies (such as Photo DNA) can lead to function creeps. For instance, the Delhi Police has sought for it to be used at least once in a criminal investigations entirely unconnected to rape or child sexual conduct.\n10. Penalty provisions: The 2011 Rules did not specify any consequences upon the intermediaries for failing to comply with the provisions of the Rules; the consequence was relatively direct \u0026ndash; they lost immunity! The Intermediaries Rules, 2021 expressly state a loss of immunity and indicate a level of severity of consequences, including potential criminal prosecution under provisions of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code [Rule 7].\nDigital News Media and Video Streaming Platforms Arguably the most significant development in the Rules is the regulation of OTT platforms and digital news media when they use other intermediary sites/apps such as Twitter or Facebook and when they host news media content on their own website/app. It is worth mentioning that the 2011 Rules did not regulate Digital News Media and OTTs. Before going into the specifics, some comment on the larger framework and its legality.\n1. Power to administer conferred upon MI\u0026amp;B: The Rules have been framed under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and as such, MeitY is the nodal ministry to administer these rules. However, as per the Intermediary Rules, Part III will be administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting [Rule 8(1)].\n2. Scope of regulation under the IT Act has been expanded: Digital news media and OTT platforms were not previously regulated under the provisions of the IT Act. This was changed with a notification under the Allocation of Business Rules. But this notification only confers administrative clarity on which ministry gets to administer the sector. It does not create the power to exercise it. For this, a clear parliamentary enactment is necessary. However, instead of going to parliament, the Intermediary Rules framed under the IT Act seek to expand the scope of regulation under the purview of the IT Act to include digital news media and OTT platforms. This amounts to the executive amending parliamentary legislation and is not permissible under the Constitution.\n3. Excessive delegation of powers: The Rules suffer from an excessive delegation of powers. As an example, the Rules have established a non-judicial adjudicatory process to resolve grievances regarding content published by Digital News Media and OTTs. They have also created an adjudicatory body which is the “oversight committee”. This is even though the IT Act does not specifically empower the Government to do so. This non-judicial adjudicatory process has been discussed in detail below.\nApart from the above, the noteworthy aspects of this part have been discussed below.\n1. A broad sweep. Not only large digital news websites: No threshold requirement of users or readership has been contemplated to differentiate between digital news media on the basis of size and scale, as has been done in Part II in the case of social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. The Intermediaries Rules have been made applicable to all publishers of news and current affairs content, as long as they have a physical presence in India or conduct the systematic business activity of making their content available in India [Rule 8(1)]. Since ‘news and current affairs content‘ has been defined as “newly received or noteworthy content, including analysis, especially about recent events primarily of socio-political, economic or cultural nature, made available over the internet or computer networks” [Rule 2(m)], the Intermediaries Rules will arguably seek to regulate a large number of internet users that engage in producing similar content on a very small scale.\n2. Regulation of foreign news media: While territorial presence is one of the requirements for digital news media to be regulated under the Intermediaries Rules, it is not a necessary condition [Rule 8(2)]. If a digital news media organisation makes its content available in India in a systematic and continued manner, the provisions of the Intermediaries Rules will apply to them. In the case of significant social media intermediaries, the Intermediaries Rules made it mandatory for them to establish a physical presence in India by appointing officers resident in India and providing an Indian address for correspondence; however, it is unclear how foreign news media organisations are sought to be regulated by Indian authorities.\n3. Code of Ethics: Digital News Media and OTTs have to adhere to a Code of Ethics which has been laid down in the Appendix to the Rules. The criteria provided in the Code of Ethics are vague, overbroad and will have a chilling effect on the free speech of publishers, as well as the right to access information for consumers of content.\n As applicable to Digital News Media: Digital News Media has to comply with Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India and Programme Code, and ensure that content which is prohibited under any law is not published or transmitted (Paragraph I of Appendix) As applicable to OTTs: This is important because OTTs have now been mandated to classify content based on the type of content as ‘U’, ‘U/A 7+’, ‘U/A 13+’, ‘U/A 16+’ and ‘A’ (Paragraph II(B) of Appendix). The OTTs have to ensure that the content which is classified as U/A13+ or higher has access control measure and content classified as A (restricted to adults) has a reliable age verification mechanism for viewership of such content, in addition to access control measures to restrict minors from accessing such content (Paragraph II(C) and II(D) of Appendix). Apart from this, the Code of Ethics also mandates OTTs to take into consideration India’s multi-racial and multi-religious context and ‘exercise due caution and discretion’ while featuring activities, beliefs, practices, or views of any racial or religious groups. This is likely to have a chilling effect on speech as it provides formal validity to the concerns which have been raised by certain groups against artistic content.  4. Grievance Redressal Mechanism: To ensure observance of the Code of Ethics, the Intermediary Rules have introduced a three-tier mechanism. The Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting, at the press conference on February 25 2021, unveiling these Rules, touted the three tier mechanism as self-regulation by the publishers with minimal governmental interference. On a closer look, it is apparent that the Rules envisage much more than ‘minimal government interference’.\n First Tier: At the first level, similar to the requirement for intermediaries under Rule 3, digital news media and OTT platforms must establish a grievance redressal mechanism and appoint a Grievance Officer, resident in India. The Grievance Officer is required to take a decision on every grievance received by it within 15 days.If the complainant does not receive a satisfactory response within 15 days, they may appeal to Level II, i.e. the self-regulating body. (Rules 10 and 11) Second Tier: At the second level, the “self-regulating” body is to be an independent body constituted by publishers or their associations, and headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, a High Court, or an independent eminent person from media, broadcasting, entertainment, child rights, human rights or other relevant fields. This body must be registered with the MI\u0026amp;B, and the MI\u0026amp;B will “satisfy itself” that the self-regulating body has been constituted properly. The self-regulating body is empowered to warn/censure/admonish/reprimand the publisher, require an apology, reclassify ratings, or even censor the content as it deems fit. If the publisher fails to comply with the directions of the self-regulating body, the matter may be referred to the Central Government at the third tier. (Rule 12) Third Tier: Level III is the oversight mechanism for the self-regulation by digital news media and OTT platforms. The oversight mechanism is an “Inter-Departmental Committee”, consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Law and Justice, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Defence, and such other Ministries and Organisations (Rule 14). The Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee will be a Joint Secretary of the MI\u0026amp;B [Rule 13(2)]. This Committee will hear complaints regarding decisions taken at Levels I and II, and is empowered to delete or modify content for preventing incitement to the commission of a cognisable offence relating to public order. [Rule 14(5)].  5. Encouraging self-censorship: While publishers are expected to self-regulate at the first tier, the provisions of the Rules are too onerous for self-regulation to effectively be complied with. Any person is empowered to make a complaint with the publisher, and the publisher must respond within 15 days, or risk censure. In terms of what this means for the regular internet-user, digital news media will have to edit their coverage to keep in mind the arbitrary manner in which overbroad restrictions are applied, particularly when the news is not favourable to the government. Further, OTT platforms, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+Hotstar, will be forced to adhere to similar censorship norms as prevail in offline movies and television content.\n6. Excessive governmental control over digital news and OTT content: While level II of the 3-tier mechanism is framed as the second layer of self-regulation, it is in fact the first layer of government control. The Chairman of the self-regulatory body is suggested to be a retired Judge of the High Court or Supreme Court, and even though the body is ostensibly expected to be appointed/elected by the media community, the MI\u0026amp;B retains approval power over the composition of the body.\n7. Executive exercise of judicial powers: The oversight mechanism, consisting of the Inter-Departmental Committee comprises entirely of members of the executive, i.e. officers from various ministries, and is chaired by the Joint Secretary, Ministry Information and Broadcasting, who is in turn supervised by the Secretary, MI\u0026amp;B. This Inter-Departmental Committee is responsible for hearing complaints arising out of the three-tier grievance mechanism. In particular, when news or OTT content is sought to be deleted or modified, it is the Secretary, MI\u0026amp;B that is empowered to take such action, on recommendation from the Joint Secretary. So basically, an aggrieved person can escalate a complaint up to the government, or the Government can directly refer a complaint to this Inter-Departmental Committee.\n8. Emergency blocking powers: The Intermediary Rules provide emergency powers to the MI\u0026amp;B in cases where “no delay is acceptable”. The Secretary may, if she/he is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient and justifiable issue directions for blocking of online content to persons, publishers or intermediary in control of hosting such information, without giving them an opportunity of hearing. (Rule 16)\n9. Range of punitive measures: The self-regulatory body of tier-II and the Inter-Departmental Committee of level-III have been provided wide-ranging punitive powers over digital news media and OTT platforms, including the power to empowered to warn/censure/admonish/reprimand the publisher, require a warning card or disclaimer, require an apology, reclassify ratings, or even censor the content as it deems fit and recommend action under Section 69A of the IT Act.\n10. Registration with the government: While taking questions from the press at the press conference, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar admitted that the government was not aware of who are the digital news media and OTT platforms. To rectify this information gap, the Intermediary Rules require digital news media and OTT platforms to furnish details of their entity and their accounts on intermediaries to the MI\u0026amp;B (Rules 5 and 18).\nWe are of the view that the Intermediaries Rules have far-reaching consequences on online privacy, freedom of speech and expression, and access to information, in addition to the constitutional issues that the Rules suffer from.

We provide you a quick rundown on its contentious history, the need for starting afresh on this vital conversation about platform accountability and also an analysis of the present draft of the rules. Given that it seeks to now even regulate digital news platforms and OTT content providers, we recommend a fresh consultation and greater transparency. Several proposals in their present form suffer from unconstitutionality and will undermine free expression and privacy for internet users in India.\nA controversial past Just to be clear, we believe that social media is broken. The large platforms owe us accountability and user rights. But a recent draft government proposal we have accessed makes this problem worse. It will increase censorship and reduce user privacy. Before we get into the specifics of the proposal, let us just do a quick recap of the history of this issue.\nOn December 24, 2018, the Indian Express first broke the news about a “confidential” meeting in which proposed amendments to the rules under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) were discussed. Section 79 of the IT Act provides what is called a ‘safe harbour’ to intermediaries who host user generated content and exempts them from liability for the actions of users on their platform if they adhere to guidelines prescribed by the government. The existing guidelines that intermediaries are required to comply with are present under the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 but the government has been contemplating changes to these guidelines since December 2018.\nAfter we learnt about the private meeting between government officials and company representatives regarding amendments to the guidelines for intermediary liability, we made available a complete copy of the draft rules because there was substantial public interest at stake. While, at first, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) denied any knowledge of any such meeting and the proposed changes, they subsequently acknowledged them and initiated a public consultation.\n  Flawed consultation Shortly after this, MeitY announced a public consultation on the proposed changes. These were proposals to make changes to the liability exemptions for online platforms or service providers. An intermediary is any service provider which transmits, hosts and publishes user content without exercising editorial control over the content like traditional publishers do. So it can be your ISP, email provider, social media platform, or any web-service which allows you to post, upload and publish. These platforms because of their technical ability to connect us to others, host our data, publish it, help us realise our freedom of speech, they mediate our online experience, impact our privacy and hold great power.\nWe feared this exercise was expending energy and resources on the basis of draft legal rules that lack any clear rationale that has been articulated by MeitY. The proposals themselves were substantively harmful to our fundamental rights to freedom of speech and privacy as we explained in our submissions. We instead advocated for a fresh start and urged the government to first publish a white paper which clearly identified the problems it seeks to solve through the proposed amendments.\nPending litigation One of the contentious provisions which had been proposed by MeitY in the December 2018 version and which also features in the latest 2021 version of the draft Rules relates to traceability of originators of information on the internet, The issue of traceability of originators of information on messaging platforms is also the subject of litigation before the Supreme Court in Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India (T.C. Civil No.189 of 2020). This case originated as a PIL before the Madras High Court seeking linking of Aadhaar with social media accounts. However, during the course of hearings before the Madras High Court, the focus shifted to traceability of originators of information on end to end encrypted platforms such as WhatsApp, and the case was later transferred to the Supreme Court.\nIFF is an intervenor in this case and we have filed an independent expert report authored by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay, which explains the long term ineffectiveness of proposals to facilitate traceability on end to end encrypted platforms. Prof. Prabhakaran\u0026rsquo;s report is in addition to our written submissions which highlight that any attempts to weaken encryption through backdoors or key escrow systems would undermine the privacy and security of all users because these vulnerabilities could be exploited by criminals as well.\n  Draft Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 Recently, there were multiple disquieting media reports (see here and here) about possible legislation to regulate OTT platforms which stream curated content such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar etc. This is especially concerning after a recent controversy over the web series Tandav (see here and here), which is the latest in a long line of incidents in which there was public outcry over a perceived slight to religious beliefs. Acting on this the Information and Broadcasting Union Minister Prakash Javadekar has recently stated that guidelines for OTT platforms are being considered by the Government.\nIt seems that from December, 2018 to February, 2021 the Draft Intermediaries Rules, 2018 have now transformed into the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.\nActing in public interest, just like we had released a prior December 2018 version of these Rules and a proposal to amend Section 66A, we are today releasing a copy of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 to the public and calling for a public consultation since these amendments will impact the fundamental rights of all Indian internet users.\n“Regulation” of Video Streaming Platforms The first of the three big changes we are highlighting is the regulation of OTT and news media platforms through proxy. We find this grossly unconstitutional. The draft IT Rules, 2021 have, in the Appendix to the Rules defined a “Code Of Ethics And Procedure And Safeguards In Relation To Digital/Online Media” which shall apply on “applicable entities”. “Applicable entities” as contained in Rule 7 include, “publishers of news and current affairs content”; and “intermediaries which primarily enable the transmission of news and current affairs content”; and “publishers of online curated content”; and, “intermediaries which primarily enable the transmission of online curated content.”\nFurther, under sub-rule (3) of Rule 8, the Rules lay down a three-tier structure for observance and adherence to the Code which is as follows, “Level I - Self-regulation by the applicable entity”; “Level II - Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the applicable entities”; “Level III - Oversight mechanism by the Central Government.” What does this mean? In all likelihood, government oversight and more censorship.\nThis oversight mechanism is being created without any clear legislative backing and will now increasingly perform functions similar to those played by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for TV regulation. For instance, as per Rule 13(4) this also now includes powers of censorship such as apology scrolls, but also blocking of content! All of this is being planned to be done without any legislative backing or a clear law made by parliament.\nAny potential legislation regarding the OTT video streaming sector in India may cause immense harm to individual rights as well as the national interest. Today, India is no longer a consumer but a producer of original high quality video content that provides employment and entertainment to audiences locally and globally. It competes actively with other countries such as South Korea and needs an environment that recognises that traditional cinema or television based regulation may irreparably harm the sector. Any such model of regulation will likely have a substantial impact on citizens’ digital rights, result in economic harm, and also negatively impact India\u0026rsquo;s growing cultural influence through the production of modern and contemporary video formats entertainment. We have written about more potential harms here.\nOn February 12, 2021, the Mint also published a report titled, “17 OTT platforms release self-regulation toolkit”, which stated that 17 of India’s largest streaming services have launched a self-regulation toolkit, under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), pre-empting government plans to bring out a code for all over-the-top (OTT) services. This toolkit builds upon the Self-Regulation Code of Online Curated Content Providers adopted by 15 Indian streaming services and digital companies. The Code has several issues itself, including providing a significant impetus towards self-censorship. More importantly, the provisions of the code relating to self-regulation may harmonise with the mechanisms laid down in clauses 11, 12, and 13, resulting in both a push towards self-censorship as well as a sizeable amount of government oversight.\nDigital News Media With respect to regulation of news media, several concerns abound. The purview of the Information Technology Act, 2000 does not extend to news media, and so the guidelines do not have the legislative backing to regulate news media. Thus, these Rules are exercising powers far beyond the parent legislation. Additionally, these guidelines are ultra vires section 79 of the IT Act, which provides a ‘safe harbour’ through an exemption from liabilities in certain cases. This makes these guidelines a camouflaged way to indirectly regulate online news media by bringing these platforms under the aegis of the Information Technology Act, 2000 instead of following the due process of parliamentary scrutiny and subsequent legislation.\nThe vague definition of “publisher of news and current affairs content” may also lead to further arbitrariness. The definition excludes replica e-papers of newspapers from its ambit. Now, will this mean media publications such as the Caravan magazine, which physically publishes a monthly magazine and was recently at the centre of a social media storm involving blockages of its Twitter accounts, falls under the category of ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’? This vagueness in definition would allow arbitrariness by the government in the exercise of significant discretionary powers and would allow them to censor media at their pleasure. Such a definition also privileges the established media houses, who may have a print newspaper as a significant component of their operations and could thus claim to be exempted from these guidelines. Smaller and independent media houses on the other hand may not have the luxury to do so, and instead rely on the internet to disseminate news and information. This discriminatory approach between online news media and traditional print newspapers and legacy media will place additional responsibilities on the former on the basis of an ambiguous definition that lends itself to confusion and uncertainty, and thus potentially stifle independent online news media.\nMoreover, it is unclear what is the purpose of requiring significant publishers of news and current affairs content to notify the Broadcast Seva established by the government. For instance, the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 required registration because it was aimed at preservation of copies of books and periodicals containing news printed in India. While this may have been necessary in 1867, such requirements have outlived their archival utility in the modern digital age with the internet maintaining a record of news and current affairs. Therefore, there is a need to fundamentally re-examine the purpose and scope of the notification requirement present under Rule 16 of the draft IT Rules, 2021. It should also be noted that while the government earlier planned to bring about these changes through a legislation which would have to be approved by the Parliament, it may now go ahead and implement it through mere executive fiat and bypass legislative debate on this issue.\n  “Traceability” and breaking encryption? The draft IT Rules, 2021 have, under sub-rule (2) of Rule 5, made it mandatory for a significant social media intermediary providing services primarily in the nature of messaging, such as Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram etc., to enable the identification of the first originator of the information. This introduces the requirement of traceability which would break end-to-end encryption. It should be noted that previous proposals which seek to implement traceability in a manner which is compatible with end to end encryption have been shown to be vulnerable to spoofing where bad actors can falsely modify the originator information to frame an innocent person. Further, the originator of the message has no control over who forwards the content, or how many times it is forwarded, or in which fora.\nMany platforms (Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram but even other platforms) retain minimal user data for electronic information exchange and also deploy end-to-end encryption to provide reliability, security and privacy to users. These are used by millions of Indians to prevent identity theft, code injection attacks and many other threats. Encryption becomes even more important now as more of our lives involve our personal data being aggregated and analysed at a scale that was never possible before. In the past, the Report of the Justice Srikrishna Committee on Data Protection has also criticised the government for mandating low encryption standards in license agreements with telecom service providers because “this poses a threat to safety and security of the personal data of data principals.”\nWithout thought or involving technical experts in an open consultative process, without any data protection law or surveillance reform, this is being tinkered with by introducing the requirement of “traceability”. To understand how encryption technologies defend and expand human freedom, we urge you to watch this Independence Day lecture by Dr. Debayan Gupta, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Ashoka University.\nThis introduction of a traceability requirement has important consequences for everyday users of online services and should also be seen in the context of the MHA notification which activates the IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009 that hold the power to direct, “decryption”. We do not have any proper parliamentary oversight or judicial check on surveillance, and the latest draft rules, if they go through, would be a tremendous expansion in the power of the government over ordinary citizens eerily reminiscent of China’s blocking and breaking of user encryption to surveil its citizens.\nIn so far as Rule 5(2) requires modifications to the design of encrypted platforms to enable traceability, it is beyond the scope of the parent provision that is Section 79 of the IT Act. Here, it is important to note that the power to prescribe encryption standards and methods originates from Section 84A of the IT Act, and not Section 79, which is a safe harbour provision. Even Section 84A empowers the Central Government to prescribe modes and methods of encryption for the purpose of “secure use of the electronic medium and for promotion of e-governance and e-commerce.” Any attempts to weaken encryption to enable traceability would not satisfy the objective of ensuring secure use of the electronic medium.\nDevelopment of AI to automate censorship? Further, under sub-rule (4) of Rule 5, the draft IT Rules made it mandatory for a significant social media intermediary (such as WhatsApp, Signal, Twitter, Instagram or Facebook etc.) to deploy technology-based measures, including automated tools or other mechanisms to proactively identify information that depicts any act or simulation in any form depicting rape, child sexual abuse or conduct, whether explicit or implicit.\nWhile these automated tools are presently proposed to be deployed in respect of highly objectionable content, such as depictions of rape or child sexual abuse, such a measure is nevertheless alarming. Once technical changes are implemented in systems very quickly they suffer from a function creep. This will be a slippery slope where use of automated tools will be expanded beyond instances of sexual violence and child sexual abuse material. For instance, in 2019, the Central Bureau of Investigation asked social media companies to use PhotoDNA, a technological tool meant to identify child sexual abuse material, to track suspects in regular criminal cases. Moreover if one reads Rule 5(4) closely, it also goes beyond to a re-upload requirement, when it states that, “or any information which is exactly identical in content to information that has previously been removed or access to which has been disabled on the computer resource of such intermediary under clause (d) of sub-rule (1) of rule 4.”\nDevelopment of artificial intelligence (AI) tools of censorship is replete with a host of risks, including the underdeveloped and imperfect nature of AI in the current state-of-the-art. AI “learns” by examining vast amounts of data, and the development of a censorship AI is likely to require social media intermediaries to store and examine large amounts of user-generated content that does not in any way relate to the kind of content sought to be censored.\nAdditionally, coding biases in the development of AI often lead to discrimination, overbreadth and a lack of accountability and transparency. This is of particular concern since the AI seeks to control and monitor the exercise of a user’s fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. It is necessary to carefully consider whether AI ought to be allowed to regulate the fundamental rights of citizens.\n  SOS! We urgently need a public consultation! The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 have the potential to fundamentally change how the internet is accessed and used by millions of users across India. Many of the changes proposed continue with greater finesse, what we had first in 2018 termed as a, “Chinese model of online surveillance and censorship”. We fear that despite material changes made to the draft rules, and some noticeable improvements in greater precision \u0026ndash; the core and the substance of these concerns remain the same, further some new areas of regulation have been added without public deliberation.\nIn some respects it has even become worse, with an illegal and unconstitutional proposed extension of executive power to regulate online news media and video streaming platforms. This makes a fresh consultation, commencing with a white paper an urgent necessity. The Internet Freedom Foundation believes in a clear need for regulation that is centred within our constitutionality and advances fundamental rights. This helps bring much needed oversight and accountability to big tech. However, the present approach, not only fails to adopt this in letter in spirit but has the potential of chilling our voices online and also hurting our privacy.\nImportant documents  Draft Information Technology (Guidelines For Intermediaries And Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (link).

Mindful of the chilling effect this could have on free speech on the internet, we wrote to the MHA highlighting our concerns related to the programme.\nNote: If you are unable to access any hyperlinks that direct back to the official website of the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, please try accessing them while in incognito mode.\nThe Cyber Crime Volunteers Program The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) has recently launched the Cyber Crime Volunteers Program. The aim of the program, as stated on the official website of the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal under the specific section for this programme, is to allow citizens to register themselves as “Cyber Crime Volunteers'' in the role of “Unlawful Content Flaggers”. As per the website, the programme will help law enforcement agencies in identifying, reporting and removal of illegal / unlawful online content. The programme, which will be launched all over the country, is going to have its test run in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and Tripura.\nWhy is this programme problematic?  Concerns related to privacy and mass surveillance    The programme could lead to increase in lateral surveillance and cyber vigilantism: Lateral surveillance refers to the phenomenon of peer-to-peer surveillance practices wherein instead of a State surveilling its subjects citizens are incentivised to surveil each other as a means of “watching over” one another as stated in their 2021 paper titled \u0026ldquo;Widening the Horizons of Surveillance\u0026rdquo; by Mira Swaminathan \u0026amp; Shubhika Saluja . Such practices will lead to a culture of surveillance and constant suspicion in society creating potential social distrust. This will give rise to the need to balance security with privacy and could result in situations of cyber vigilantism.\n  Lack of necessity for the programme: The offences included into the scope of this programme under the website of National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal are already cognizable and can be reported to the police by any person. Therefore, there is ongoing confusion as to the necessity of this programme as well as the need to create a special class of volunteers.\n  No prior verification required for becoming a “Cyber Volunteer Unlawful Content Flagger”: Under the programme, I4C and the MHA have allowed a person to register as a “Cyber Volunteer Unlawful Content Flagger” without fulfilling the requirement of any prior verification (KYC). Since no verification is required and the nature of the position itself is voluntary, it absolves the I4C as well as the MHA of any liability or guilt in cases of misuse. In Nandini Sundar \u0026amp; Ors vs State Of Chattisgarh (2011) 7 SCC 547, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that it is the duty of the State to undertake all those necessary socially, economically and politically remedial policies that lessen social disaffection and develop well trained, and professional law enforcement capacities and forces that function within the limits of constitutional action. Creation of this volunteer programme goes starkly against both these duties since it will allow social disaffection to be weaponized by amateurs who have little to no understanding of constitutionally protected speech.\n  Concerns related to online free speech    Lack of underlying legal framework: The programme has been launched by the I4C without having any underlying legal framework or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in place which would regulate the functioning of this programme and define its parameters. The terms and conditions which have been laid out on the official website of the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal for this programme do not refer to any underlying legal framework as well. In the absence of such a framework, the possibility of misuse and arbitrariness increases as there are no clear guidelines to be followed in its implementation.\n  Lack of clarity with regard to the definition of “anti-national activities”: The website of National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal provides little insight into what is included into unlawful content (content that is against sovereignty and integrity of India, against defence of India, against security of the State, against friendly relations with foreign States, content aimed at disturbing public order, disturbing communal harmony falls into broad categories whose judicial interpretation lies in a grey area thus giving excessive discretion to a volunteer to determine which content is unlawful). Further, the Tripura and the Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir press circulars for the MHA’s volunteer programme go one step further and ask volunteers to report content pertaining to, inter alia, “radicalisation” and “anti-national activities” without actually defining which content constitutes the two categories. This could lead to overzealous and overbroad restrictions being put onto the freedom of speech online and could further result in a chilling effect on online speech wherein citizens would self-regulate themselves before posting any content online for fear of being maliciously prosecuted through this programme. Such a programme would thus be in direct violation of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v Union of India (2013) 12 SCC 73 which highlights the need to ensure that overbroad restrictions on online speech are not used as a tool by the State to criminalise free speech on the internet.\n  Doubts over authenticity of reports received: Since there is no legal backing or SOP in place, another doubt which arises is how will the authenticity of these reports be ensured. There is currently no information that has been made available on the official website which outlines how the I4C and the MHA will ensure that this programme is not misused by certain elements to extract misguided personal/political vendettas. It should also be noted that there is no process in place for withdrawal of complaints once submitted. Currently, according to a report titled, “MHA tells States to register more FIRs for cybercrime” published in the Hindu on November 1, 2020, the conversion rate of complaints registered on the portal into First Information Reports (FIR) is only 2.5%.\n  India is not 1950\u0026rsquo;s East Germany The Stasi was the Ministry for State Security for the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which governed the German Democratic Republic for 40 years from 1950 to 1980, without ever being legitimised in a democratic election. To quash all forms of dissent, the Stasi relied on a network of around 2 lakh informants who spied on friends, colleagues and relatives. \u0026ldquo;The perception that the Stasi was all-knowing also led to self-censorship.\u0026quot; \u0026ldquo;Laid out upright and end to end the files the Stasi kept on their countrymen would form a line 180km long\u0026rdquo; as per the book \u0026ldquo;Stasiland\u0026rdquo; by Anna Funder.\nThis programme by the MHA, which purportedly aims to bring together \u0026ldquo;Good Samaritans\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;passion to serve the nation on a single platform and contribute in fight against cybercrime in the country\u0026rdquo;, will essentially result in a similar situation to the one which East Germany was in the 1950s. Asking citizens to report their fellow citizens would lead cyber-vigilantism, as stated above, and would lead to peers turning against their peers to snitch on them. Since, the MHA has failed to clearly define unlawful content and content which would relate to \u0026ldquo;anti-national\u0026rdquo; activities, this could allow the volunteers to exercise far more discretion than is necessary and report on citizens who are well within their rights to post content which is critical of the State. This kind of \u0026ldquo;lateral surveillance\u0026rdquo; could lead lead to a culture of surveillance and constant suspicion in society creating potential social distrust as per the 2021 paper titled \u0026ldquo;Widening the Horizons of Surveillance\u0026rdquo; by Mira Swaminathan \u0026amp; Shubhika Saluja. While we appreciate the MHA\u0026rsquo;s intention behind trying to reduce harmful content online, this programme will lead to ultimately result in more harms and thus is not the solution for this issue.\nOur recommendation In our representation, we have thus recommended to the MHA that this programme be halted immediately.\nImportant documents  Representation to MHA on Cyber Crime Volunteers Programme dated February 23, 2021 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/cyber-volunteer/","summary":"A new programme allows citizens to register themselves as \u0026ldquo;unlawful content flaggers\u0026rdquo; to report online content for removal.

Union of India. Our representation was in the backdrop of the Rajasthan Government authorizing Divisional Commissioners to order internet shutdowns which is impermissible under existing law. In our representation, we have urged the Rajasthan Government to ensure that internet shutdowns are only ordered by properly authorised officials and are periodically reviewed by the State Level Review Committee. In addition to this, internet shutdown orders must be proactively published on official government websites and also through print and electronic media.\nBackground With 72 documented internet shutdowns since 2012, Rajasthan has witnessed the second-highest number of internet shutdowns in India after Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. Internet shutdowns cause severe hardship to ordinary citizens. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left people heavily dependent on the internet to access online education, telemedicine, work from home facilities and virtual court hearings. In addition to its impact on the general population, internet shutdowns also significantly damage the economy. For instance, recent estimates suggest that the Indian economy suffered USD $ 2.8 billion losses in 2020 due to internet shutdowns.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the most recent internet shutdown in Rajasthan was imposed on 02.11.2020 when the State Government suspended internet services in Kotputli, Patwa, Shahpura, Viratnagar, Jamwa Ramgarh, Madhorajpura, Dudu, and Mozamabad for 24 hours in response to the Gurjar reservation protests. Before this, the State Government had suspended internet services in several districts of Rajasthan on 17.10.2020 and 30.10.2020, also in response to the Gurjar reservation agitation. While such restrictions may be well-intentioned and aimed at preventing loss of human life and property, they may prove to be counterproductive because empirical studies suggest that internet shutdowns incentivize those forms of violent protests which require less communication and coordination than peaceful demonstrations.\nWe had previously obtained copies of at least 22 internet shutdown orders issued in Rajasthan from 2017 to 2019 through the Right to Information Act, 2005. An analysis of these orders reveals that Divisional Commissioners issued all the orders under Rule 2(1) of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 (Telecom Suspension Rules). These orders state that the power to impose internet shutdowns was delegated by the Home Secretary, the actual authority mentioned in Rule 2(1), to Divisional Commissioners through a letter issued on 02.09.2017 bearing reference no. F 35(1) Home-9/2006.\n(IL)Legality - Non-Compliance with Telecom Suspension Rules As mentioned above, the problem in Rajasthan is the issuance of internet shutdown orders by Divisional Commissioners who are not empowered under the Telecom Suspension Rules to exercise this power. Telecom Suspension Rules only permit the State Home Secretary to issue such orders. While the State Home Secretary can delegate the power, the delegate must not be below the level of a Joint Secretary. Moreover, any orders issued by the delegate must be confirmed by the Home Secretary within 24 hours. However, the orders supplied by the Rajasthan Government in response to RTI requests do not contain any orders issued by the Home Secretary, which approve the orders issued by Divisional Commissioners.\nThis practice of delegating the power to impose internet shutdowns to Divisional Commissioners was also discouraged by the Department of Telecommunications, Government of India (DoT) in 2018. In its letter to the Rajasthan Government, DoT had noted that frequent disruptions were being ordered by Divisional Commissioners in Rajasthan and urged the state government to reconsider its stance and ensure strict compliance with the law.\nAnother problem in Rajasthan is that internet shutdown orders are often not reviewed by the Review Committee established under Rule 2(5) of the Telecom Suspension Rules. The Review Committee is expected to serve as a procedural safeguard that ensures the extraordinary power to suspend internet services for the entire population of a region is exercised in a non-arbitrary and proportionate manner. As per RTI responses received by civil society groups, the Review Committee constituted for the State of Rajasthan has failed to perform this role in many cases. Between July 2017 and May 2018, the State Government ordered around 40 internet shutdowns, but the Review Committee reviewed these restrictions only in 11 cases.\n(IL)Legality - Non-Compliance with Anuradha Bhasin After the judgement of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, additional procedural safeguards have also been read into the Telecom Suspension Rules. These safeguards require proactive publication of all internet shutdown orders and periodic review of internet restrictions every seven working days by the Review Committee.\nAfter the judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India being delivered on 10.01.2020, there have been at least four internet shutdowns in Rajasthan, reported by the media. However, to the best of our knowledge, the orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules to authorize these recent internet shutdowns have not been published on official government websites or made available through print and electronic media.\nRecommendations In view of the non-compliance with the law by the Government of Rajasthan in issuing internet shutdown orders, we have requested the Government to -\n Revoke letter no. F 35(1) Home-9/2006 dated 02.09.2017, which authorizes Divisional Commissioners in Rajasthan to order internet shutdowns. Issue an advisory clarifying that the powers available under Rule 2(1) of the Telecom Suspension Rules cannot be delegated by the Home Secretary to government officials below the rank of Joint Secretary, and the Home Secretary must confirm any orders issued by the delegate within 24 hours. Direct the State Level Review Committee established under Rule 2(5) of the Telecom Suspension Rules to review all internet shutdown orders within five working days of an order being issued. Publish all internet shutdown orders issued after the judgement of the Supreme in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India was delivered on 10.01.2020. This requirement applies to suspension orders issued by the Home Secretary and his/her delegates and review orders issued by the Review Committee under the Telecom Suspension Rules. These orders should be published on official government websites and also through print and electronic media. Commission an independent study to evaluate the effectiveness of internet shutdowns at preventing violence and examine less restrictive alternatives such as fact-checking or removing specific posts.

Several concerns have been raised over the report, with two members of the Committee filing dissent notes. Thus, we decided to provide this explainer that breaks down the key issues with both the report and the original Bill.\nIntroduction The Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change submitted its report on the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 on February 3rd, 2021. The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on July 8th, 2019, and was referred to the Standing Committee on October 17th, 2019.\nThe Report contains certain general observations by the Committee. The Committee expressed the view that while the concerns raised about the misuse of DNA technology are not unfounded, such concerns do not negate the need for a robust legislation that would enable the creation of an ecosystem where DNA profiling is done in a manner consistent with Constitutional principles. However, the Committee did underline the need for the government to assuage any such concerns. Additionally, the Committee stated the following:\n The components of the framework (police, prosecution, and judicial services) must be independent, and impartial checks and balances must be implemented at each step In line with the Rule of Law, illegally procured evidence must be made inadmissible so as to protect against the erosion of fundamental rights Natural rights such as rights against self-incrimination must be ensured (especially given the prominent role of the same in the constitution) All evidence, and not simply evidence of guilt, must be presented before courts A well-developed system of independent experts must be established that can verify the government’ claims in court This must be complemented by a well trained judicial system that is equipped to handle complexities arising from scientific evidence.  The Committee also had clause-by-clause recommendations on the provisions of the bill, including:\n Clause 2 1(iv) - Acknowledging the concerns raised by members of the Committee, a ‘crime scene index’ may be admitted but the government must address the aforementioned concerns Clause 2 1(v) - Regional DNA data bank are not required, and a National DNA data bank will suffice Clause 2 1(vii) - ‘Testing’ should replace profiling to make it clear that DNA data banks will only store profiled DNA and not all tested DNA Clause 4 (a), (d), - Given that the regulatory board must be an independent body: 1) a person of eminence in the field of biological sciences or genetics must be added to the board and be given the position of chairman, 2) the Director-General of the NIA and the Director of the CBI should be replaced with a retired Director of the CBI. Clause 26 2(a) - GIven the concerns raised by members of the Committee, ‘suspects index’ and ‘undertrials index’ may be kept, by the government must address these concerns in Parliament.  What are its legislative and policy origins?    Document Recommendations/provisions     The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 Provides for the regulation of use of DNA technology for establishing the identity of certain persons.    What are the proposed objectives of the DNA Bill? As stated by the Committee, the Bill’s purpose is:\n enabling the identification of victims apprehending repeat offenders of heinous crimes developing stringent standards for DNA profiling regulating the use of DNA profiles for lawful uses.  A regulatory board is proposed to be created, whose functions will be to:\n Advise governments on related issues Grant accreditation to DNA laboratories Establish DNA data banks at the national and regional levels.  Noting the lack of research on the use of scientific evidence in courts that has resulted in unrigorous evidence being accepted, the Committee also hoped that the Bill would foster the creation of an ecosystem that will allow the legal system to become experienced in the use of DNA evidence.\nWhat is public opinion on the issue? Two members of the Committee, Asaddudin Owaisi and Benoy Viswam, have filed dissent notes to the report, alleging that the report does not adequately take into account concerns about privacy and may result in the targeting of minority groups.\nAsaddudin Owaisi lamented the fact that despite recognising such concerns, the Committee has retained clauses that would allow the systematic profiling of dalits, muslims, and adivasis, given that these groups are disproportionately incarcerated. He stated that the Bill failed to meet the standards set by the Puttaswamy judgement of the Supreme Court which acknowledged the right to privacy as fundamental and laid down certain proportionality standards required to be met for the infringement of the same. He also noted the concerns about privacy would be exacerbated by the absence of a data protection legislation, and called for stringent safeguards to protect against inherent institutional biases and genetic discrimination.\nBenoy Viwam raised similar concerns, once again noting the contravention of Puttaswamy standards and the right to privacy. He pointed out that the lack of adequate safeguards would lead to the misuse and abuse of the law as a tool for targeting people over their caste, religion, or political affiliations. Here, IFF submitted extensive testimony and analysis to the Parlimentary Committee which to our regret has not been incorporated in the recommendations of the report or the changes suggesed to specific clauses.\nWhat are the fundamental issues? We thank the chairman on the committee for the extensive and wide-ranging consultation process. However, we would like to note our disappointment about the outcome of the process. As acknowledged by the Committee, there are a host of issues that surround the regulation of the use of DNA technology for criminal profiling. Given the wide-ranging consultation conducted, it is regrettable that recommendations which could have helped ameliorate such concerns have not been adopted by the Committee. That the dissent notes filed by the members convey this very sentiment adds to the sense of dissatisfaction.\nOne of the key issues is the nature of DNA technology itself. The use of DNA samples to determine culpability has faced questions over its effectiveness - while its usefulness has been acknowledged, the unrestricted use of DNA as incontrovertible (due to notions of its infallibility) has been criticised as unscientific. In Jitendra v. State of MP, the Madhya Pradesh High Court admitted the casual nature of DNA based inferences and did not acknowledge the presence of DNA material as direct evidence of culpability. Furthermore, as acknowledged by the Committee as well, a significant lack of capacity pervades the india DNA technology landscape, which further hinders the quality of DNA analysis. This has been acknowledged by the legal system as well, as seen in Rajiv Singh v. State of Bihar where the Supreme Court dismissed improperly analysed DNA evidence.\nPrivacy and data security Another important issue is the invasion of privacy. The Supreme Court’s judgement in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors. enshrined the right to privacy as fundamental and provided 5 key standards which would have to be met when affecting the right to privacy: legality, a legitimate state aim, necessary for the specified objective, proportionality, and the existence of procedural safeguards. The DNA profiling of citizens through a DNA data bank may fail these standards, as such a move may disproportionately affect citizens’ right to privacy. This stems from the Bill’s reliance on archaic notions of privacy, given that it was drafted before the Puttaswamy judgement. This was argued at length by our executive director, Apar Gupta in his testimony before the Parliamentary Committee.\nIndeed, even basic standards of consent may be overridden, as clause 21 of the Bill allows bodily substances to be obtained from a person without consent if the appropriate magistrate believes that analysing said substances may confirm or disprove culpability. Apart from the vaguely worded definitions that confer significant discretionary powers, such provisions constitute a gross violation of an individual’s right to privacy.\nThe absence of a robust data protection law provides further space for the misuses of DNA data by state or potentially even private actors. Standards timelines for data retention have also not been mentioned - existing laws such as the Habitual Offenders Act specify timelines for data collection, retention, and deletion - while no data protection obligations have been explicitly imposed on DNA testing laboratories.\nAdditionally, the majority view of the Committee seems to be that privacy and data security concerns have been adequately addressed: when responding to Asaddudin Owaisi’s dissent note, the chairman Jairam Ramesh stated that he did not “see the connection” between the DNA bill and the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 since “the Bill deals with as different universe of data”, and that the Data Protection Authority proposed by the latter should not have powers of oversight over the DNA regulatory board. We find this reasoning to be inadequate as the Draft Data Protection Bill, 2019 does classify DNA to be a senstivite class of personal data but then provides for large exemptions to Government entities from the operative safeguards.\nDiscretionary powers and fiscal costs The amount of discretionary powers granted under the Bill have also not been adequately addressed. For example, clause 54 of the Bill allows the government to supersede the board through a simple notification. Such a provision could be misused to increase the scope of powers beyond what may be necessary or proportionate, while also contravening the Supreme Court’s judgement in Dr.Subramanian Swamy vs Director, Cbi \u0026amp; Anr, which clarified that the excessive delegation of legislative powers to a statutory authority would make a law susceptible to being stuck down. Clauses 56 and 57 are similarly extravagant in their granting of powers; the former allows the Centre to amend schedule, thereby allowing it to potentially expand the Bill beyond the scope of its original intention and thus violating the principle of purpose limitation, while the latter bars the operations of the DNA regulatory board from judicial review. Once again, it is disconcerting that the Committee failed to acknowledge such concerns and accepted these clauses without modification.\nThe lack of capacity for operationalising DNA testing infrastructure and conducting widespread training of DNA professionals, prosecutors, and even judges also has a significant cost. The estimates of Rs 20 crore as an initial capital investment plus Rs 5 crore per annum for conducting the relevant activities are quite steep, and indeed likely underestimate the actual cost that would be incurred. In an economy ravaged by the pandemic and with government revenues shrinking, government expenditure may be better directed towards more urgent issues, especially for an endeavour that has faced concerns from several concerns and may significantly infringe upon the privacy of citizens.\nPotential for Profiling and Discriminatory Targeting The most dangerous outcome that may result from improper usage of DNA technology is the discriminatory DNA profiling of citizens, as has been admitted by the Committee itself. The nature of DNA data necessitates extreme precautions with respect to its processing, as well as additional safeguards to protect against biases. The very methods of analysis have also been questioned, as the statistical modelling algorithms used in DNA analysis have been found to embed judgements of those who created them. At the very least, such concerns should promote an approach towards DNA testing that does not promote DNA evidence as infallible.\nThe evidence in numbers This is even more important in the Indian context, since, as has been pointed out in the dissent notes filed by the members of the Committee, the indian justice system disproportionately incarcerated minorities and marginalised communities. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau states that as of September 2020, 16.6% of convicts, 18.7% of undertrials, and 35.8% of detenues are muslim, even though muslims make up only 14.2% of the population. Similarly, 21.7% of convicts, 21% of undertrials, and 18.15% of detenues are dalits, even though dalits make up only 16.6% of the population.\nThe Committee itself mentioned the case of a false encounter in which innocents who were thought to be militants were killed. In such a situation, the use of DNA technologies may lead to the targeting of different segments of society. The use of wide ranging crimes indices, which in the view of some members are unnecessary and possess the potential for abuse, further stokes concerns about group-based profiling. Yet again, despite the concerns raised by members (including the chairman), recommend the retention of the provision.\nRecommendations In light of the above, here are a few suggestions to address these issues as we hope to avoid a dystopian outcome that has DNA Databases that are used to target vulnerable sections of Indians for decades:\n Puttaswamy Compliance: The sensitive nature of DNA data and its multifarious uses necessitate a significant review of the Bill from a daa security and privacy perspective. This need is all the more pressing given that the Bill was framed before both the Puttaswamy judgement and the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and thus relies on outdated notions of privacy. Thus, it is recommended that the Data Protection Authority contemplated by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (or any other forthcoming Authority) be empowered to conduct an extensive review of the Bill to ensure that its provisions are consistent with the standards laid down in the Puttaswamy judgement. Reduced scope: The use of crime indices must be dropped from the Bill. Given the lack of evidence of its efficacy in civil cases, DNA evidence must be barred from use in the same. In case the use of DNA evidence in civil cases is accepted, such evidence must be barred from storage in any database. Possible uses of DNA Data must be restricted to those laid down in the Bill, and any powers of delegation accorded to the government must be removed. The use of DNA data for training purposes must also be banned. Consent as paramount: Under the presumption of innocence, overrides to the obligation for consent must be rethought. At the very least, stringent standards must be set for the overriding of a lack of consent. Reduced discretion: Discretionary powers provided to the government and the regulatory board, such as those mentioned above, must be reduced. The appropriate provisions must be codified and laid before the parliament. All rules and regulations notified under the Bill must be mandated to be laid before the parliament as well. Data Security: Clear standards and timelines for data retention and deletion must be mentioned. Extraneous data from crime scenes, as well as the data of suspects and under trials must be barred from being processed as evidence, and only the DNA data of convicts must be allowed to be processed and stored. Remedies for harms: While the Bill does specify certain penalties for committing offences that fall under the ambit of the Bill, the Committee has not recommended any additional mechanism for providing remedies for those whose DNA data is used in an unlawful manner.

These reports stated that discussions over updating the Act to better deal with modern technologies and challenges. These changes would also involve harmonising the Act with the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.\nOn February 3rd, 2021**,** an answer to a Lok Sabha question **** stated that “MeitY has initiated work on amendment to the Information Technology Act, 2000 which, inter alia, includes strengthening the provisions for intermediaries for making them more responsive and accountable to Indian users.” Furthermore, **** an RTI request **** we had filed received an answer on February 4th, 2021 that revealed that the Ministry had begun to interact with stakeholder ministries over potential amendments to the Act.\nNeed for change In the two decades since the Information Technology Act, 2000 was originally enacted, significant technological, policy, and legal developments have taken place that subsequent amendments have not been able to completely account for. The ubiquity of smartphones and internet technology in modern life calls for a new paradigm of regulation on diverse subjects such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies, electronic financial services, and online gambling.\nAnother key development is the emergence of progressive data protection paradigms. In its judgement in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, the Supreme Court struck down section 66A as unconstitutional and draconian, stating that the provision was vaguely drafted and significantly violated the right to free speech guaranteed under articles 19, and 21 of the Indian Constitution. However, this progressive judgement has been hampered by the continued use of the provision (or similar provisions) in the indian legal system, as acknowledged by the Supreme Court itself. Our Zombie Tracker tool has provided a detailed a list of these \u0026lsquo;legal zombies\u0026rsquo;, with 1,988 cases having been registered under section 66A as of today. Thus, there is a need to provide safeguards against such phenomenon.\nAdditionally, in light of the Supreme Court’s judgement in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors, provisions of the Act that relate to privacy, such as section 69, to accommodate the proportionality standards laid down in the aforementioned judgement. For example, the recent debacle over the account blockages on Twitter have attracted signficiant public furore over section 69A, which has attracted criticisms not only with respect to proportionality but also with regards to operational transparency. Provisions that relate to data protection, such as sections 43A and 67C, may also need to be brought in line with modern data protection practices and the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.\nRecommendations Given the attendant concerns that arise from the above, we requested the Ministry to publish a full consultation timeline over any potential amendments in line with several health precedents for public consultations set in the past. Presently, no such timeline exists, while the Standing Committee on Information Technology also does not seem to be considering this issue (it does not seem to be in the list of subjects or in the list of sittings - see here). Furthermore, we ask that extensive dialogues be conducted with academics, civil society, digital rights experts and organisations, and technologists, as such groups would provide a unique citizen-centred perspective that would complement the more business or administration friendly inputs of other stakeholders.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s letter to MEITY Regarding potential changes to the Information Technology Act, 2000 (link) The Information Technology Act, 2000 (link) Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 235 (\u0026ldquo;Privacy Policy of Whatsapp\u0026rdquo;) answered on 03.02.2021 (link) RTI Request DITEC/R/E/21/00054 filed with the Department of Eelctronics and Information Technology (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/it-act-amendments/","summary":"Given recent media reports and parlimentary responses, we wrote to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asking them to publicly detail any potential amendments to the Information Technology Act, 2000 and engage in extensive consultations over the changes.","title":"The Times Are A-Changing: Ensuring IT Act amendments are progressive"},{"content":"  Tl;dr The PM-WANI scheme, announced by the Department of Telecommunications last month, aims to increase internet connectivity across the country by implementing a decentralised system of public access points. We decided to create an explainer analysing the scheme in which we discuss how, while a step towards the right direction, the scheme faces both foundational and implementational challenges.\nWhat is the PM WANI scheme? PM WANI (Wi-Fi Access Network Interface) is a scheme meant to increase Wi-fi access throughout the country. The WANI framework contains the following components:\n Public Data Office (PDO): It will establish, maintain, and operate only WANI compliant Wi-Fi Access Points and deliver broadband services to subscribers. Public Data Office Aggregator (PDOA): It will be an aggregator of PDOs and perform the functions relating to Authorization and Accounting. App Provider: It will develop an App to register users and discover WANI compliant Wi-Fi hotspots in the nearby area and display the same within the App for accessing the internet service. Central Registry: It will maintain the details of App Providers, PDOAs, and PDOs. To begin with, the Central Registry will be maintained by C-DoT.  The scheme shall work in the following manner:\n Any entity desirous of becoming a PDO sets up a Wi-Fi access point by purchasing network services from a service provider. The PDO registers with a PDOA that is registered on the App. Now, any potential user in the vicinity of a Wi-Fi access point, after registering and authenticating themself on the App, selects a PDO to connect to. This request is sent to the relevant PDOA who, after, authenticating the user, will display tariff plans to the user. Once the payment has been made to the PDOA, the PDOA registers the user and provides them with the requisite Wi-Fi access.  What are its legislative and policy origins?    Document Recommendation     DoT’s National Digital Communications Policy, 2018 Mentions the development of of public Wi-Fi hotspots in rural and urban areas as a goal Mentions further liberalizing the spectrum sharing, leasing and trading regime   TRAI’s Consultation Paper on Proliferation of Broadband through Public Wi-Fi Networks Lays down the core principles of an ‘unbundled and distributed model’ for public Wi-FI hotspots. Details the app-based hub framework that WANI has adopted    What are the proposed objectives of the PM WANI scheme? It is contemplated that the proliferation of public Wi-Fi networks throughout the country will greatly increase internet access at cheap prices. Increased Wi-Fi access will bring with an improved quality of life, especially in an increasingly digital economy. The deregulated operating requirement is meant to help improve the ease of doing business, and thus potentially provide both employment opportunities and increased disposable income. Furthermore, the decentralised nature of the WANI ecosystem is meant to address last mile connectivity and allow access points to grow organically in places that need them the most.\nInternet Access \u0026amp; the Digital Divide As of June 2020, the number of internet subscribers increased to 749.07 million, a 0.79% increase over the previous quarter, and a 4.2% increase over December 2019. The number of urban and rural subscribers increased to 455.98 million and 293.09 million respectively.\nWhile internet penetration in the country is rising, a persistent digital divide still remains due to factors such as gender gaps and the rural-urban divide. The number of rural subscribers, despite making up a significant majority of the population, is only 64% of the number of urban subscribers, with rural internet density only about a third of urban internet density. Meanwhile, NFHS data suggests that in eight states and two union territories less than 40 percent women have used the internet.\nWhat is public opinion on the scheme? The scheme has generally been applauded. Many commenters have praised the scheme and said that it will greatly increase internet connectivity across the country. Industry bodies have said that such a move will provide a massive stimulus to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities.\nAt the same time, several issues have been raised. Foremost among them is the question of security: public Wi-Fis are known to be susceptible to attacks and breaches, while there is a lack of specificity with regards to data protection norms. The economic viability of such a project has also been questioned, given the lack of success of similar models hitherto. Lastly, while a step towards viewing internet access as a ‘positive right’, questions have also been raised about whether the scheme may amount to a dereliction of duty from the state.\nConcerns about the security of data and the role of the state Open public Wi-Fis have been known to be vulnerable to hacks and breaches. The security architecture used may often not possess sufficient security standards, and so may leak data. Furthermore, many websites, including government portals, may not always have security credentials such as HTTPS or SSL certificates, and so accessing such websites through public Wi-Fis may be even more dangerous.The possibility of rogue networks acting as PDOs also exists, where hackers may spoof a legitimate network for malicious purposes.\nFurthemore, in the absence of a robust data protection legislation, both usage data and any personal or sensitive information entered for the purpose of authentication may also be at risk. The deregulated environment, while perhaps good for business, only exacerbates the issues. The guidelines for the scheme only discuss this in a cursory manner, stating that PDOAs shall “take all necessary steps to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of any information about a third party to whom it provides the service” (Para 4(c)). Thus, there is a clear need for comprehensive security guidelines to be included in the framework.\nAnother peculiarity of the scheme can be found in Para 4(c) of the guidelines, which states that “PDOA shall make necessary provisions for storage of user data for one year to ensure compliance with legal provisions, as required”. This may clash with the RIght to be Forgotten which, while not recognised as an absolute right, is still a key part of India’s privacy framework. Indeed, the latest draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 that was introduced in Parliament enshrined the Right to be Forgotten as fundamental.\nLastly, while PM WANI is a major step towards addressing the issues of internet connectivity, the reliance on the private sector and the withdrawal of the state must be analysed. India still has a persistent ‘Digital Divide’, which has only worsened after the onset of the pandemic. Thus, it is crucial that not only is high speed internet connectivity provided, but also that it is done so at low rates, which may not always be possible with the private sector.\nNow, as of May 2019, the Universal Service Obligation Fund had Rs. 50,554 crore available for appropriation and usage. Given the very aim of the Fund was the provision of telecom services in rural and remote areas, it is imperative that the Centre urgently use such Funds towards telecom infrastructure (in this context, the increased budgetary allocations to the Fund are to be commended). This would enable the provision of internet connectivity to those areas that need it the most, while also overcoming the hurdle of high capital costs.\nImplementation challenges The economic viability of such projects in the indian contexts must be questioned. The availability of cheap data means that the demand for public data may be limited, especially in urban areas. Similar projects have been implemented before by diverse entities from tech giants like Google and Facebook to small scale players such as WiFi Dabba without much success, with the main issue being cheap and widely available 4G data.\nGoogle even noted that “several governments and local entities have kicked off their own initiatives to provide easier, cost-effective access to the Internet for everyone”. This further underlines the benefit of governmental initiatives in the sector. Furthermore, the ‘aggregator’ model that has been adopted has been heavily critiqued for its exploitation of workers. This may end up prohibiting the increasing of incomes, the achievement of which has been stated as a goal of the scheme. Public sector projects would be able to ameliorate such concerns as well.\nRecommendations In light of the above, here a few steps that may address such issues:\n Stringent security measures: Robust information security protocols must be specified to ensure secure connections. This is especially important in the context of the scale at which the implementation of the scheme is envisioned. Furthermore, stringent data protection measures must be mandated to protect against data leakage and the illicit usage of sensitive information by PDOAs or hackers. Increased governmental efforts: The Universal Service Obligation Fund must be the primary medium of broadband deployment, especially in marginalised areas. At the very least, a high level technical committee must oversee a country wide survey, that must be conducted with the aim of partitioning districts into those that would be served by the Fund and those in which the PM WANI scheme could be harnessed.

In a letter to the Parliamentary Standing Committee, we relay our concerns to them and ask them to call relevant stakeholders such as ministry officials and privacy experts to depose before them.\nWe wrote to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on IT On November 27, 2020, we launched Project Panoptic with the aim of raising public awareness around the use of facial recognition technology. The use of this harmful technology is being done secretively throughout the country, with most citizens unaware that they are under the gaze of a camera equipped with the technology.\nBy raising public awareness through transparency, we hoped to drive accountability for these projects and the authorities which are developing and deploying them. However, another goal which we had envisaged for Project Panoptic was to drive policy change. It is with this aim in mind that we have written to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology asking them to conduct hearings on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India.\nThe Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has included its scope issues related to citizens’ data security and privacy. One of the rising concerns that affect citizen’s data security and privacy in the country today is the unregulated and illegal use of facial recognition technology by various government authorities at the State and Central level. Use of the technology has risen exponentially in the past two years, with India at the cusp of launching the world’s largest facial recognition technology system through the National Crime Records Bureau under the Ministry of Home Affairs.\nThe use of this technology by various governmental authorities, however, has already started. On March 11, 2020, the Ld. Minister of Home Affairs, Mr. Amit Shah, while replying to a short duration discussion on the Delhi riots in the Lok Sabha, stated that, “Police have identified 1,100 people through facial recognition technology”. As per a report titled, “Delhi Police Arrests Man Who ‘Instigated’ R-Day Tractor Rally Violence” published on India.com on February 8, 2021, facial recognition technology is also being used to identify individuals who were present during the incident and protests that occurred on Republic day at the Red Fort in New Delhi, with one person being arrested through the use of this technology.\nIf Facial Recognition Technology is allowed to be utilised by the government without legal authority, regulation and oversight, it would lead to the violation of fundamental rights such as the right to privacy, right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to protest peacefully.\nOur recommendations  Conduct hearings and summon government departments: There is a need for engagement with the Government in order to obtain clarity on this deep violation of human rights. We ask that significant Government officials - especially from the National Crime Records Bureau and other relevant government agencies and law enforcement - be invited to depose before the Committee in order to obtain transparency through official disclosure. Therefore, relevant ministry officials from all ministries who have started to develop and deploy facial recognition technology should be asked to depose before the Committee, specifically including but not limited to the, Ministry of Home Affairs (National Crime Records Bureau); Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; Ministry of Civil Aviation; Ministry of Railways; Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology; Election Commission of India. Seek expert opinion: The Committee may also seek expert opinions from individuals and organisations who have been working on the privacy impacts of use of facial recognition technology in the country. These must squarely focus not only on the privacy impacts but also the discrimination, feasibility and exclusion caused by such facial recognition technology use by the government, which are by their very nature mass surveillance measures.

Furthermore, the process by which the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology initiated the blocks is excessively opaque. We wrote to the Ministry asking them to make the orders publicly available so as to increase transparency.\nA Timeline of the Events Late in the afternoon on 1st February, several news reports emerged of multiple Twitter accounts being blocked in response to a legal request from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Based on the reports, it seemed as if close to 250 accounts, belonging to a diverse group of entities such as news media organisations, politicians, activists, and farmers groups, were reported to have been blocked.\nThe rationale purportedly as per press reports was that these accounts had been making provocative tweets about the farmer protests and had been using a specific hashtag. However, this was not substantiated, as such direction issued purportedly under Section 69A has not yet been made public.\nSubsequent media reports claim that Twitter contested the order as per observable inferences. While Twitter subsequently restored the blocked accounts by the evening of 1st February after significant public outrage, concerns about secrecy, proportionality and arbitrariness have been raised. Furthermore, on February 3rd, the Ministry is reported to have sent an order to Twitter warning it about this decision.\nThe Ministry, pointing to Twitter’s obligations as an intermediary bound by Centre’s guidelines under section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, asked Twitter to comply with the earlier order or face criminal proceedings with penal consequences of imprisonment for up to 7 years. A press note also seems to have been privately circulated amongst various media outlets that provided further details about the same and outlined both the rationale behind the initial order as well as the Centre’s stance on Twitter’s response.\nOn 8th February, fresh reports emerged of a new order having been sent by the Ministry on 4th February, sharing a list of 1,178 more accounts that it wanted removed.\nA lack of accountability and transparency Such actions are harmful not only for operational transparency but also for India’s democratic ethos. The accounts in question have pointed out criticisms of the government in the past, and so blocking such accounts, especially those that belong to media organisations such as Caravan, is tantamount to censorship (especially when the government has failed to substantiate the grounds on which the order for blocking was based).\nThe secrecy and lack of a clear process with respect to the blocking of the accounts is especially concerning if directions have indeed been made under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. From news reports no show cause notice or opportunity to present a defence has been provided to the users of these accounts. Indeed, Twitter did not even notify most of these accounts about their access being withheld.\nAdditionally, the directions themselves, which would contain the reasons for why the accounts have been directed to be suspended, have not been made public. This directly impacts the users of the accounts with respect to their fundamental rights to freedom of speech and expression and access to judicial remedies. Furthermore, it is in breach of the directions of the Supreme Court in the Shreya Singhal (paras 117, 118, \u0026amp; 119) and Anuradha Bhasin Judgements (paras 15, 16, 17, \u0026amp; 18) that recognise the public’s right to receive public information and any censorship for it being as per principles of transparency and proactive disclosures.\nRecommendations In light of the above, we urge the Ministry to recall these directions for blocking of the Twitter accounts and in future commence any proceedings by providing a fair and clear opportunity to the users of accounts to participate and present their defence. Further, any eventual orders under Section 69A must be made publicly available.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s letter to MEITY regarding \u0026lsquo;Secretive and disproportionate directions issued to Twitter under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000\u0026rsquo; (link) A previous post containing an analysis of the The Information Technology [Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules], 2018 (link) Our comments and counter comments on the proposed changes to the Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/government-censorship-and-the-dire-need-for-transparency/","summary":"Recent events regarding the blocking of pro farmer protests Twitter accounts reek of government censorship.

Till then, 4G mobile internet connectivity was only available in 2 out of 20 districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir, which were Ganderbal and Udhampur. The move follows international condemnation of the internet shutdowns being imposed near the borders of Delhi and in Haryana to suppress farmers' protests but it is also grounded in the research, reporting, public advocacy and strategic litigation carried on by local groups for the last one and a half years.\nA complete communication shutdown was first imposed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 05 August 2019 in the immediate aftermath of abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution. During this time, all communication channels including landlines, voice calls, SMS services, fixed line internet and mobile internet were suspended. This communication shutdown was challenged by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of Kashmir Times before the Supreme Court. Other journalist bodies including the Foundation for Media Professionals and the Indian Journalists Union intervened in the case to support Ms. Bhasin\u0026rsquo;s challenge. Another petition was also filed by Ghulam Nabi Azad, the former Chief Minister of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir, who highlighted the impact of the communication shutdown on people\u0026rsquo;s livelihood and income.\nThe Supreme Court delivered its judgement in Ms. Bhasin\u0026rsquo;s and Mr. Azad\u0026rsquo;s petitions on 10 January 2020 where it laid down progressive principles relating to necessity and proportionality of internet restrictions but stopped short of granting immediate relief. The government was directed to review its internet shutdown orders in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court, and in response, there was some relaxation in the internet restrictions. Initially, selective access was provided to whitelisted websites, and eventually, access was granted to all websites including social media platforms. However, mobile internet speed continued being slowed down to 2G which is hopelessly outdated and inadequate in this day and age.\nWith the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, another round of litigation was initiated before the Supreme Court by the Foundation for Media Professionals since people in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir were unable to access telemedicine, online education, remote work facilities and virtual court hearings due to the internet slowdown. The Supreme Court delivered its judgement in this case on 11 May 2020 and established a Special Committee headed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs to examine the necessity and proportionality of the internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir.\nSince there was no information available in the public domain about the functioning of the Special Committee, a third round of litigation had to be initiated by the Foundation for Media Professionals seeking compliance with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s judgement. During the course of hearings in this contempt petition, the government revealed that the Special Committee had deliberated upon the issue and recommended staggered restoration of 4G mobile internet in low risk areas starting with one district in Jammu Division and Kashmir Division each. Subsequent to this, 4G mobile internet was restored in Ganderbal and Udhampur on 16 August 2020 but internet speed continued being slowed down to 2G in the remaining 18 districts.\n  Most recently, on 25 December 2020, the Private School Association of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which represents over 3800 member schools in the region initiated a fourth round of litigation before the Supreme Court challenging the prolonged internet restrictions as violative of the fundamental right to education. Students in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir were already at a disadvantage due to prolonged school closures since 05 August 2019, and even during the COVID-19 pandemic, they had been unable to shift to online learning because of the internet speed restrictions. The petition was likely to be listed before the Supreme Court next week and the government has pre-empted another court hearing by restoring 4G mobile internet.\nWhile the restoration of 4G mobile internet in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir was much needed and long overdue, it is important not to lose sight of the harm and losses that have been caused in the last 550 days. No citizen of a democracy should have to suffer through what the people of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir experienced, and going forward, we need to keep pushing for greater transparency and accountability to prevent this from happening again. We, at IFF, had the opportunity to provide legal assistance to the Foundation for Media Professionals, Indian Journalists Union and Private School Association of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir through multiple rounds of litigation. We fully intend to continue working on the broader issue of internet shutdown reform because there are still compliance failures with respect to proactive publication of internet shutdown orders.\nAs a parting note, we would like to acknowledge and thank the lawyers who have helped us provide legal assistance in these cases including Senior Advocates Huzefa Ahmadi and Dushyant Dave, Advocates on Record Shadan Farasat and Astha Sharma, Advocates Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Bharat Gupta, Gautam Bhatia, Kajal Dalal, Abhishek Manchanda and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay. We would also like to extend our gratitude to Revati Laul who painstakingly collected personal testimonies of residents of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and Prateek Waghre who provided a technical analysis of web performance at 2G v. 4G speed. There are many more people and organizations who have worked on this issue and we are glad IFF could play a small role in ending this gross violation of digital rights.\n \u0026ldquo;The restoration of 4G internet access in Jammu and Kashmir is a welcome step and we commend the people there who have shown tremendous courage and dignity in this distressing period of deprivation and hopelessness. All of us here at IFF have each day kept you in our hearts, minds and work as we have represented clients including the Foundation for Media Professionals, the Indian Journalists Union and the Jammu and Kashmir Private Schools Association before the Hon’ble Supreme Court.

We wrote a letter to the Ministry in which we detailed potential harms that may arise from such regulations, asked for clarity regarding any potential regulation, and requested a thorough implementation of the pre-legislative consultation policy.\nPotential regulations for OTT Recently, multiple disquieting media reports (see here and here) about possible legislation to regulate OTT platforms of curated content such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar etc. This is especially concerning after the recent furore over the web series Tandav (see here and here), the latest in a long line of incidents in which there was public outcry over a perceived slight to religious beliefs. Such events seem to have put enough public pressure to make the Information and Broadcasting Union Minister Prakash Javadekar to explicitly state that guidelines for OTT platforms shall be forthcoming.\nAny potential legislation regarding the OTT video streaming sector in India may cause immense harm to individual rights as well as the national interest. Today, India is no longer a consumer but a producer of original high quality video content that provides employment and entertainment to audiences locally and globally. It competes actively with other countries such as South Korea and needs an environment that recognises that traditional cinema or television based regulation may irreparably harm the sector. Any such model of regulation will likely have a substantial impact on citizens’ digital rights, result in economic harm, and also negatively impact India\u0026rsquo;s growing cultural influence through the production of modern and contemporary video formats entertainment. We have written about more potential harms here.\nThe broader picture In November last year, a Cabinet Secretariat notification amended the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 and designated the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting as the nodal ministry under which regulation of online media falls. We have written about the implications here before here, detailing possible harms towards the freedom of journalistic expression and artistic creativity.\nMoreover, there is no underlying enactment or legal authority for the Ministry to conduct actions which may cause censorship (such as receiving complaints and forcing content to be removed). Hence, there is a clear absence of any legal power to take such actions. Public policy harms may also result from the Ministry becoming grievance redressal cell (as has been the case with the recent controversies over various online media content), where its principal function may become being a post office for wide ranging grievances around the incredible diversity of content that exists on the internet. This may further stoke greater forms of censorship in a sector that is witnessing a high amount of creativity and demonstrating India’s leadership in the cinematic arts especially suited towards younger and global audiences.\nRecommendations If no such legislative intervention is being contemplated, we request that a press statement must be put out at the earliest, if only to quell anxiety and dispel rumours.\nHowever, if any such legislation is indeed being discussed:\n It needs to be put through a robust process of public consultation in line with the Pre-legislative Consultation Policy. Ideally, such a process would be initiated by the release of an approach paper outlining the vision for the regulations, if any. It should also be open to considering whether a policy of forbearance from legislation may be the correct prescription at this moment in time. Subsequently, an independent committee must be constituted. This committee must compose of noted artists, creative professionals, and academics with an emphasis on ensuring a diversity of perspective and expertise as well as a lack of political bias - this will ensure a greater amount of trust in the committee in the public sphere.

On one hand, it contains eminently praiseworthy allocations towards programs such as Digital India and the Universal Services Obligation Fund while also providing a stimulus to innovation and R\u0026amp;D; on the other, allocations towards the PMGDISHA remain low, while concerns remain that significant capital expenditure may not take place.\nA Broad Picture Budget 2021-22 has cumulatively allotted Rs. 72,558.9 crore to the National Digital Health Mission, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and the Department of Telecommunications:\n For the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, this is a 12% increase over the Revised Estimates of 2020-21, which were a 9% decrease over the actual spending for 2019-20. The Revised Estimates were 17% less than the Budget Estimates in 2020-21. For the Department of Telecommunications, this is a 43% increase over the Revised Estimates of 2020-21, which were a 45% increase over the actual spending for 2019-20. The Revised Estimates were 38.1% less than the Budget Estimates in 2020-21. For the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, this is a 75% increase over the Revised Estimates of 2020-21, which were a 2% decrease over the actual spending for 2019-20. The Revised Estimates were 19.6% less than the Budget Estimates in 2020-21. A huge 459% increase in total capital expenditure over the Revised Estimates of 2020-21 can be observed, stemming largely from a 495% increase from the Department of Telecommunications. However, praise for these allotments must be tinged with hint of caution, as the Revised Estimates of 2020-21 for capital expenditure in the Department were only 17% of the Budget Estimates of 2020-21. While it is possible that the lower spending is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the actual spend on capital expenditure in 2019-20 was also at similarly low levels (Rs. 4,929.5 crore) .    \u0026ldquo;Budgetary allocations for selected items (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology witnessed a huge boost in allocations, with Rs. 9,720.7 crore being allocated to it in the Budget. This is mostly due to an increase in the allocation to the Digital India Program, which received Rs 6,806.3 crore and whose share in the total allocation increased from 55% in the 2020-21 Revised Estimates to 70% in the 2021-22 Budget Estimates. This itself stems from an increased focus on domestic manufacturing, as shown by the increased allocation of Rs. 2,631.3 crore towards the Promotion of Electronics and IT HW Manufacturing.\n  \u0026ldquo;Breakdown of allocation for MEITY (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  There has also been an increased impetus for innovation and digital technology. Rs. 150 crore has been allocated towards the promotion of IT/ITeS industries, which are a 50% increase over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates. Meanwhile, Rs. 200 crore has been allocated towards the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, which is a 58% increase over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates. In general, an increasing trend can be seen in terms of allocations towards innovation.\n  \u0026ldquo;Allocations towards innovation and technology (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  While these increased allocations are welcomed, it must be noted with some consternation that the allocations for Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA) are relatviely subdued. Furthermore, even though the increased allocation in the 2021-22 Budget Estimates are a 20% increase over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates, the Revised Estimates themselves were only 60% of the 2020-21 Budget Estimates. In an increasingly digitalised economy, given the Centre\u0026rsquo;s push towards digitalisation, a digital literacy training scheme like PMGDISHA is crucial for ensuring that rural citizens stake their claim to the fruits of the fourth industrial revolution and truly become a part of modern India.\n  \u0026ldquo;Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA) (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  Additionally, capital expenditure has failed to keep pace with revenue expenditure, with the allocation for the former witnessing \u0026lsquo;only\u0026rsquo; a 26% increase over the Revised Estimates of 2020-21. The share of capital expenditure, already at a low level, decreased to 4.6%.\n  \u0026ldquo;Share of Capital Expenditure in Total Expenditure\u0026rdquo;\n  The Department of Telecommunications The Department of Telecommunications was allocated Rs 58,737 crore in the Budget, a substantial increase of 43% over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates. This is largely due to a large increase in support to Public Sector Undertakings. Both BSNL and MTNL were provided with capital infusions for providing 4G services and grants-in-aid for the payment of GST, with the PSUs receiving Rs. 16,656 crore and 7,428 crore respectively. It is likely, however, that this may be due the COVID-19 pandemic reducing expenditure and thus causing the payments under the VRS schemes of BSNL and MTNL to be pushed forward to 2021-22.\n  \u0026ldquo;Breakdown of allcoation for DoT (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  The Universal Services Obligation Fund (USOF) also witnessed a considerable increased in allocation, which can only be commended. The net allocation to the USOF increased to 9,000 crore, a 25% increase over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates. The latter was itself 90% of the 2020-21 Budget Estimates, indicating a high level of utilisation.\n  \u0026ldquo;Net USOF allocation (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  The USOF is a key component of the project to build India\u0026rsquo;s digital infrastructure. Its function is to extend telecom network infrastructure and stimulate an uptake in the usage of ICT services in rural and remote areas, where higher capital costs may prohibit market players from establishing themselves. Thus, it serves to bring internet access to marginalised communities, and so the increased allocation towards the Fund will play a vital role in boosting internet usage.\nA large component of the increased allocation is due to the higher allocations for BharatNet. BharatNet is a governmental telecom infrastructure provider that aims to provide an Optical Fiber Network in each gram panchayat in the country, and so the increase allocation Rs 7,000 crore (a 27% increase over the 2020-21 Revised Estimates) is greatly welcomed.\n  \u0026ldquo;Allocation towards BharatNet (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting witnessed a relatively modest (compared to other bodies in consideration) boost in allocations, with budgetary allocations going from Rs. 3,650.3 crore in the Revised Estimates of 2020-2021 to Rs. 4,071.2 crore in the Budget Estimates of 2021-2022. With the support to autonomous bodies (such as Prasar Bharti and the Press Council of India essentially stagnant (a paltry 0.5% increase compared to the Revised Estimates of 2020-2021), the growth in allocations originates from a robust 28% increase in Central Establishment Expenditure and a huge increase of 82% in funds allocated to Central schemes.\n  \u0026ldquo;Breakdown of allocation for MIB (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  An increased spend on Information and Publicity may be noticed, with Rs 460.8 crore being allocated to this (compared to Rs. 354.9 crore in the Revised Estimates of 2020-2021). However, spending on the same has fluctuated over the years. Indeed, not only were the Revised Estimates a 22% decrease over the Budgetary Estimates of 2020-2021, they were also 3% less than the actual spending in 2019-2020.\n  \u0026ldquo;Allocations towards Information and Publicity (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  The main thrust of the increase under the expenditure on schemes comes from three budget heads: Broadcasting Infrastructure Network Development, Development Communication and Information Dissemination, and Development Communication and Dissemination of Filmic Content.\nWhile there is cause for optimism, a certain trend can be discerned: Budgetary Estimates in 2020-2021 increased allocations significantly over the Actual Spending in 2019-2020, then Revised Estimates in 2020-2021 witnessed a massive reduction, and then Budget Estimates in 2021-2022 saw the allocations pop back up again. This may lead to concerns that Actual Spending in 2021-2022 would be at similar levels, especially since the Budget Estimates for 2021-2022 are significantly below the Budget Estimates for 2020-2021 (15% drops for both for the first two schemes) or only exhibit a modest increase (6.2% for the latter).\n  \u0026ldquo;Allocation towards MIB Schemes (Rs. cr)\u0026rdquo;\n  Important Documents  Budget 2021-22 website (link) Demand for Grants: Department of Telecommunications (link) Demand for Grants: Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (link) Demand for Grants: Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting (link) Consolidated budgetary data for selected items (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/budget-2021-22/","summary":"Budget 2021-22 is a mixed bag.

Since the statement was published, the government of Haryana has issued another order extending the internet shutdown till 05:00 PM today i.e. 01 February 2021 in 14 districts.\nWe fear that internet shutdowns have become the government\u0026rsquo;s routine response to protests and we urge other Indian organisations and individuals to consider endorsing this joint statement which demands immediate restoration of internet services at the borders of Delhi and affected districts of Haryana. You can endorse the joint statement through this signature campaign.\nText of the Joint Statement \u0026ldquo;We, the undersigned organizations and individuals, strongly condemn the internet shutdowns imposed by central and state government authorities to suppress the farmers’ protests at the borders of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. At present, there are lakhs of farmers who are protesting against the central government’s attempt to deregulate and privatize India’s agricultural sector which they believe would destroy their livelihoods. The farmers have been peacefully protesting at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders for two months. However, subsequent to the Republic Day tractor parade on 26 January 2021, there has been a crackdown against the farmers protesting at the borders with electricity and water supply also being allegedly cut off in some areas. Most disturbingly, there have been reports of violence being inflicted upon the farmers by unidentified mobs and police personnel. It is against this backdrop that we raise alarm about the use of internet shutdowns by government authorities to suppress the free flow of information related to peaceful assembly and the fundamental right to protest.\nInternet services were first shut down by the central government on 26 January 2021 in Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri, Mukarba Chowk, Nangloi and adjoining areas from 12:00 to 23:59 hours. Subsequent to this, orders were issued by the state government of Haryana suspending internet services in several districts from 27 January 2021 to 30 January 2021. 17 out of 22 districts in the state of Haryana have no internet. 3 of these districts have had a complete shutdown for more than 72 hours.Furthermore, SMS services are also suspended with exception of banking and mobile recharge. Most recently, the central government has issued an order suspending internet services in Singhu, Ghazipur,Tikri and their adjoining areas from 23:00 hours on 29 January 2021 to 23:00 hours on 31 January 2021. These internet shutdown orders have been issued under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 and they do not adhere to the standards of necessity and proportionality endorsed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.\nThe internet shutdown orders are impermissibly vague and they do not provide any specific facts and figures which would demonstrate proper application of mind prior to their issuance. In fact, the use of internet shutdowns may be counterproductive because empirical studies suggest that internet shutdowns incentivize disorganized violence by cutting off channels for communication and coordination which are necessary for planned peaceful protests. There is already substantial police and paramilitary presence at the protest sites to identify and stop individuals who may be engaging in illegal activities, and a blanket internet shutdown which deprives lakhs of people of internet access is wholly unnecessary.\nThe harm caused by these internet shutdowns outweigh any speculative benefit. The government authorities have expressed concerns about the farmers’ protests leading to property damage while justifying the internet shutdowns. However, we urge the government authorities to remember that internet shutdowns caused US$ 2.8 billion losses to the Indian economy in 2020 and telecom operators lose INR 2.4 crore for each hour of an internet shutdown. Further, these internet shutdowns are causing massive inconvenience to the general public living near the protest sites and in adjoining areas. The residents of these areas are unable to access online education and remote work facilities which are essential during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, these internet shutdowns have made it practically impossible for journalists to provide real time updates about the protests and taken away the farmers’ ability to present their version of events through social media. Since the farmers have raised serious concerns about the mainstream media not covering their protest in an accurate and fair manner, it is imperative that they are allowed to put forth their perspective through their own social media channels. Moreover, shutting down the internet also prevents citizens from verifying news that they receive, therefore it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop the spread of fake news and misinformation. Farmers are also finding it hard to get supplies in absence of internet and SMS services which is impacting their right to life.\nFor these reasons, we call upon all central and state government authorities to respect the fundamental rights to freedom of speech and expression and peaceful protest guaranteed by the Constitution of India. Internet services must be immediately restored at the borders of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and such arbitrary and unnecessary internet shutdowns must not be imposed in the future.\u0026rdquo;\nImportant Links  Campaign website to collect sign-ons (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/joint-statement-internet-shutdown-farmers-protests/","summary":"IFF along with FSMI and SFLC.in raises alarm about the use of internet shutdowns to undermine the fundamental right to peaceful protest.

While the emphasis laid on improving access and equity is commendable, we feel there are certain concerns that the economic survey must tackle. These include questions raised about the commercialisation of healthcare and the viability of remote learning in the Indian context, as well as the overarching paradigm of viewing data primarily as a resource.\nHealthTech and health data On the whole, the Survey does seem to recognise the risks posed by the indiscreet application of emerging technologies to privacy. At a more granular level, though, the Survey seems to view the existence of information asymmetries in the health sector as the primary concern, in lieu of which it prescribes the use of emerging technologies to remedy such problems. Such an approach may result in other issues, given the extractive model of data collection envisaged under the NDHM mission. Other concerns, such as the the commoditization of citizens’ data in the absence of a robust data protection legislation and the Aadhaar-centric nature of framework, also abound and may have wide-ranging implications for data security and exclusion from welfare entitlements.\nGiven the central role accorded the health sector by the Survey, the acknowledgement that \u0026ldquo;unregulated private enterprise can create significant negative effects\u0026rdquo; is key (even more so in the health sector). Issues of data privacy and access loom even larger in the case of private healthcare, and so it is also heartening to see moves towards increasing public expenditure. In a pandemic ravaged economy, not only will such steps generate strong fiscal multipliers but also solve issues of access, exclusion, and affordability. However, the need to ensure the protection of citizens' data still remains, if only to ensure that the receipt of constitutional welfare benefits does not become predicated upon the invasion of privacy.\n  \u0026ldquo;Source: Economic Survey 2020-21\u0026rdquo;\n  Commodification of data The Economic Survey 2020-21 is to be commended for focusing on access and equity, but the template which has been set is concerning. Following in the footsteps of the chapter 4 of the Economic Survey 2018-19, it views data as a resource and accords data commoditization a higher priority than the safeguarding of digital rights. This technocratic approach may work to the detriment rather than the progress of citizens, eventually creating more issues than it has set out to solve.The Survey acknowledged that unregulated private enterprises can create significant negative effects. The 2018-19 Survey itself noted several harms to privacy and data security which are yet to be addressed. Moreover, we still do not have a comprehensive data protection legislation that will safeguard our data protection and privacy from excessive public and private interference. It is imperative that this is enacted with proactive stakeholder consultation, because automated decision making needs regulation, and the possibility of biases and excursions must be considered. To do this, existing and expansive critiques must be urgently taken into account.\nThe importance of internet access One important trend in healthcare that was witnessed over the last year is the burgeoning adoption of telemedicine and eConsultations. As might be expected, these were given a huge fillip by the lockdown.\n  \u0026ldquo;Source: Economic Survey 2020-21\u0026rdquo;\n  As the Survey itself notes, apart from an optimal level of health infrastructure ,the smooth functioning of telemedicine depends on robust internet connectivity. In light of this, the importance given to healthcare implies an equivalent level of importance for internet access. Furthermore, given the increasingly digital nature of the modern economy, internet access is a vital component of daily life. Thus, it is essential that the fundamentalness of access to internet be acknowledged by the Survey and that internet access be recognised as a \u0026lsquo;basic necessity\u0026rsquo;.\n  \u0026ldquo;Source: Economic Survey 2020-21\u0026rdquo;\n  The Survey point out the progress being made towards improving the deep digital divide that exists within the country: overall teledensity, the number of internet subscribers, and average wireless data consumption per month are all increasing, while average data costs are falling. The Centre\u0026rsquo;s BharatNet project has also established full network infrastructure in 93% of the targeted Gram Panchayats.\nHowever, given the aforementioned significance of internet access, it is regrettable that the Survey does not take cognisance of the increased number of internet shutdowns. Internet shutdowns have been criticised for their all-encompassing nature, which results not only in significant curbs upon the Right to freedom of Expression but also causes significant economic losses. Concerns about human rights have also been raised.\nRemote learning and distance learning The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the use of remote-learning and distance-learning technologies. While to some extent necessitated, the widespread adoption of such technologies will inevitably result in an educational divide across various groups, with low income rural children being impacted the most.\n  \u0026ldquo;Source: Economic Survey 2020-21\u0026rdquo;\n  To remedy this, the Centre has undertake several initiatives to improve digital technology for education, including establishing the PM eVIDYA scheme to unify all digital education efforts and increasing budgetary support to States for digital education initiatives. Such efforts may not be enough, as may be witnessed by increased dropout rates due to a lack of resources, and so significant budgetary capacity must be allocated to ensure that a generation of students receive the education they deserve.\nAdditionally, the increasing use of facial recognition technology through proctoring software and student authentication portals bring with them tremendous risks to the privacy of students.\nInnovation The lack of R\u0026amp;D investment has also been acknowledged, especially given the size of India\u0026rsquo;s economy and its level of development. A key reason for this is low gross domestic expenditure on R\u0026amp;D (GERD).\n  \u0026ldquo;Source: Economic Survey 2020-21\u0026rdquo;\n  The Survey also indicates a poor performance with respect to capacity, with the levels of researchers and R\u0026amp;D personnel being low compared to India\u0026rsquo;s population.\n  \u0026ldquo;Source: Economic Survey 2020-21\u0026rdquo;\n  The National Science Foundation of the US has said that 80% of the jobs that will be created in the next decade will require some amount of mathematical and scientific skills. Resolving these twin issues will play a key part in developing a thriving scientific community, fostering innovation, and ensuring that India\u0026rsquo;s economy is well equipped for the 21st century.\nImportant Documents  The Economic Survey 2020-21 Volume I (link) The Economic Survey 2020-21 Volume II (link) The Economic Survey 2020-21 Statistical Appendix (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/economic-survey/","summary":"While the emphasis laid on improving access and equity is commendable, there are certain concerns that the Economic Survey must address.

Should our privacy not be safeguarded in health and education?"},{"content":"  tl;dr Since our last report in the month of December, IFF has filed 32 RTI requests. Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of January, we have up till now filed 32 RTI requests with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government.\nNote: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month\u0026rsquo;s report may be included in the present report.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 30 requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology.

Free Speech and Censorship Our other main focus is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the month of January, we have up till now filed 2 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Department of Telecommunications on the amendment of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017.

In our comments, we highlighted several issues, including the need to expand STI capacity by increasing R\u0026amp;D spending, improving inclusion and access, and promoting open science.\nThe existing state of play As the world proceeds further into the 21st century, it is clear that the future is digital, and that emerging technologies that hitherto could barely be countenanced will change human lives in a significant way. The National Science Foundation of the US has said that 80% of the jobs that will be created in the next decade will require some amount of mathematical and scientific skills. In such a context, It is imperative that India prepares itself for such a future by possessing a thriving scientific community and a booming technology base. The challenge is to create systems that harness a large number of graduates in the sciences and engineering to improve India’s science and technology ecosystem.\nAs per S\u0026amp;T indicators collected and compiled by NSTMIS, DST, GoI in 2019, India’s GERD has been stagnant to just 0.7% of the GDP for the last 5 years. When compared to 31 most developing \u0026amp; developed countries, India ranks at a concerning 26th position standing last among the BRICS nations.\n  \u0026ldquo;Source:Research and Development Statistics, 2019-20\u0026rdquo;\n  Further, the S\u0026amp;T indicators highlight the need to set clear fiscal targets to increase India’s per capita expenditure on research \u0026amp; development from 47.2 (current PPP$) to 300 (current PPP$) coming slightly above the current world’s average in next 5 years.\n  \u0026ldquo;Source:S\u0026amp;T Indicators Tables, 2019-20\u0026rdquo;\n  Meanwhile, in spite of recent strides, private sector investment in R\u0026amp;D remains low: in 2004-05, the private sector accounted for 28% of research spend; it was 40% in 2016-17. Indian corporate hesitancy about spending on R\u0026amp;D is well documented, with most private sector entities having “a limited risk-appetite to invest in futuristic technology.”\nLastly, while things have been improving, many concerns with respect to exclusion in STEM fields still remain. For example, in 2017, the share of male students enrolled in engineering and technology is 71.1% compared to female enrolment, which is just 28.9%. Meanwhile, as of 2019, central government data indicates that across 23 IITs only 2.8% of the faculty come from SC, ST, or OBC backgrounds.\nOur submissions We believe that the draft policy contains many excellent proposals. We appreciate the key themes and guiding principles being laid down, and at the same believe a certain amount of granularity in terms of implementation must be added to ensure that the frameworks laid down here actually come to fruition. While such lofty goals are eminently laudable, without a way to measure these progress towards these goals there is a danger of such outcomes simply remaining words on paper. Furthermore, there remain certain outstanding issues particularly focussed on rights based frameworks which must be addressed.\n Transparency and Accountability: The draft policy contains very laudable goals and proposals. However, certain portions lack granularity in terms of the implementation, and so would be helped by an increased amount of specificity. This would help to improve transparency and public accountability. Improving inclusion and access: Indian academia has faced many questions over the levels of inclusivity and diversity within it. While the policy does acknowledge these issues and indeed does try to address them, certain focus areas require a greater amount of attention. This would demand expanding the scope of existing policies, creating frameworks for representation, and conducting assessments based on data to create inclusivity and diversity indexes for institutions. Increasing STI Capacity: India’s Gross Domestic Expenditure on R\u0026amp;D lags significantly behind global peers at 0.7% of GDP over the last five years. To boost capacity and STI funding, expenditure on R\u0026amp;D should be ramped up to 1.7% of GDP. Facilitating Innovation: Despite possessing a large number of engineering graduates, India does not produce enough innovation, as evidenced by low amounts of private sector investment in R\u0026amp;D. To boost innovation and take advantage of emerging technologies, private sector investment into R\u0026amp;D must be facilitated. However, public funding for R\u0026amp;D should not lag behind. Promotion of Open Science and IP Law: The draft policy\u0026rsquo;s focus on Open Access is highly commendable and sorely needed, especially given contemporary happenings with respect to academic journal copyright. To supplement the vision of Open Access laid down, the scope of the provisions should be expanded to include all research, and a legislative framework for universal access to scientific knowledge must be created. Increasing focus on quality of scientific output: Despite ranking 3rd globally for scientific publications, India does not produce enough high quality scientific research. To address this, ‘research audits’ must be undertaken for every field to understand shortcomings and devise effective solutions. Open Science and FOSS: To complement the more academic focus of the Open Access framework, the Open Science framework should adopt Free and Open Source Software. This will foster grassroots innovation and allow different entities and stakeholders to collaborate and take advantage of the latest technologies and scientific developments. STI Policy and Sustainable Development Goals: International bodies have called for nations to develop an STI roadmaps for the fulfilment of each Sustainable Development Goal. In light of this, the draft policy must prescribe a robust and evidence-based monitoring mechanism to track implementation with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals.

While some of these issues were addressed, certain concerns about the security of the portal still remain.\nThe purpose of the portal On the 25th of November 2020, The Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry launched a national portal for transgender persons to apply for certificates and identity cards. Through the portal – transgender.dosje.gov.in – transgender persons could apply for certificates and identity cards digitally without having to visit any government office and could also monitor the status of their application through the portal itself.\nSecurity issues emerge Last year, we were CC\u0026rsquo;d on an email to the NIC, informing them about certain vulnerabilities in the portal’s architecture. The table below contains a list of the issues and their status.\n   Description of Issue Status     Sensitive data can be accessed by changing URL Addressed, but could still potentially be accessed   All hitherto submitted forms can be accessed by changing URL Addressed, reverse engineering the hash function to gain access once again   Unsecure website, does not have HTTPS or SSL certificate Still present   Lack of security controls for registration Still present    Thus, while some of these issues have been addressed, certain vulnerabilities persist:\n SSL vulnerabilities: The portal is not SSL secured which means that all data in the website is not secured and the data can be accessed by hackers. SSL certificate helps to encrypt the data while passing it between web servers and websites. In general sense, the data is locked and can only be unlocked by the intended recipient so that all the sensitive information may be protected. Hence, this is absolutely necessary for a portal that handles information that can be categorised as extremely sensitive in nature. As the portal does not use SSL, there is high possibilities of leakage of personal data of the users of the portal. This makes the portal not secure for handling any information that is of a sensitive nature. This information can be misused and be used for identity theft or even for targeting the already vulnerable transgender individuals. Lack of security controls: It is very easy to register onto the site by using a fake email id and phone number, and there isn’t any verification done (such as an email verification) to check whether candidates registered are actually legitimate or not. And so, any individual with the help of fake email IDs and phone numbers can create an account in the portal. By creating an account, one can learn the database architecture of the portal and analyse the weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and attack them, thereby enabling them to access data that is available on the portal. If registration continues to happen so easily without strict verification, the personal and sensitive data of all the users registered to the portal are at all times vulnerable to attacks from hackers. Rather than forcing any linking of government IDs in the sign-up process we recommend an inclusionary registration process that is designed in consultation with cyber security professionals.  Urgent need for privacy The judgement of the Supreme Court in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India granted transgender persons legal recognition as the ‘third gender’, and thus affirmed their fundamental rights as guaranteed under the constitution of India. Additionally, the Supreme Court’s judgement in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) vs Union Of India And Ors. affirmed the Right to Privacy as fundamental. Given the constitutional recognition of transgender persons, the Puttaswamy Judgement, when read along with Articles 14 (Equality before law), 19 (Protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech), and 21 (Protection of life and personal liberty), thus implies a strong privacy doctrine for the information of transgender individuals as a constitutional obligation, and so the deprivation of the same due to leakages effectvively amounts to a deprivation of fundamental rights.\nFurthermore, given prevalent societal mores and norms, the safety of the data of transgender persons is paramount. Much has already been written about gender and surveillance, with transgender people facing extremely high levels of both digital and physical threats. These threats, together with deeply ingrained biases and misbeliefs, have already lead to both focused surveillance and physical injury (or even death).\nRecommendations  If the issues listed above are not immediately dealt with and resolved, it could lead to data theft which could further lead to financial fraud and identity theft for the users of the portal. Furthermore, applying for certificates through the portal may be a less taxing experience than doing so by physically going to a government office, and so the importance of this portal is clear. Thus, we request swift redressal of the above enlisted issues. Cyber security is a complex process that requires dynamic activities to neutralise emerging threats. To ensure that such issues do not reoccur with the portal, a technical audit of the portal must be conducted. The National Informatics Centre has 33 Empanelled Information Security Auditing Organisations, many of which have conducted significant audits for government agencies such as the NIC, NPCI, and the SBI. Such organisations are technically capable of being tasked with auditing the portal.  If you are unable to discern any other fragilities in the portal\u0026rsquo;s security architecture, please do let us know.\nThis representation was drafted with the help of Rohan Mathew, a legal and policy intern at IFF.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s Representation to the NIC regarding vulnerabilities in the National Portal for Transgender Persons (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/protect-trans-rights-now/","summary":"Last year, we had received a complaint that the National Portal for Transgender Persons contained several vulnerabilities that could be exploited to access the sensitive personal data contained within.

Firstly, we filed RTIs and then we wrote to them highlighting our concerns.\nWhat is the CBSE doing? As per a news report published in the Indian Express, the CBSE is now using facial recognition technology to provide access to digital documents to students. The application will enable students to download their digital academic documents of classes 10 \u0026amp; 12 after a live image of the student is matched with the photograph on the CBSE admit card already stored in the repository.\nFirst step: Right to Information Pursuant to this, we filed a Right to Information request with CBSE bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/03761 on October 28, 2020 asking them to provide information about the scope and nature of the project. In their reply dated November 24, 2020 bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/03761/3176, CBSE stated that they were not using facial recognition technology instead they were using face matching technology thereby trying to create a measure of difference between the two.\nAs a result, we filed another RTI request on December 10, 2020 bearing reference no. CBSED/R/E/20/04158 asking CBSE to explain how the face matching technology operates. However, even after the prescribed time limit of 30 days within which a reply has to be provided expired, the CBSE has failed to provide any response to our second request. As a result, we have filed a first appeal highlighting the CBSE\u0026rsquo;s failure to respond. We still await further information on this for which we reserve our rights to remedies as per law.\nNext step: A recommendation to halt use by highlighting concerns Since we have received no response on our last RTI request, we decided to write to the CBSE highlighting the various concerns that use of facial recognition brings with it.\nA. Concerns related to privacy\nUse of this technology, in a legal vacuum, especially with regard to children, is extremely concerning as pertaining to the fundamental right to privacy. Here, we take the liberty to draw your attention to the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1 which says that certain standards have to be met in order to justify intrusion by the State into the right to privacy. These standards are :\na. Legality (existence of a law) : Where the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions.\nb. Legitimate goal/state aim : Which justifies that the restriction to people’s privacy (in this case data collection and sharing) is needed in a democratic society to fulfill a legitimate state aim.\nc. Proportionality : Where the Government must show among other things that the measure being undertaken has a rational nexus with the objective. The state must also demonstrate that there are no other alternatives both analog and digital which can fulfil said mandate which are less intrusive but equally effective; and that the extent of the interference is proportionate to its need.\nd. Procedural guarantees to check against the abuse of State interference : Where there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse.\nLaws with regard to facial recognition which may act as anchoring legislations, unfortunately do not exist in India thereby failing to satisfy the first Puttuswamy standard. Additionally, the use of FRT by CBSE fails to satisfy the proportionality requirement since, according to the reply sent to us by CBSE, it is just one of the authentication mechanisms being used under the multi-factor authentication process in place. Finally, there are no procedural guarantees, such as a data protection law, in place to ensure that misuse of the technology does not take place thereby increasing the risks related to its use.\nB. Concerns related to exclusion\nIn addition to concerns related to privacy, concerns relating to exclusion due to inaccurate technology become a factor here. This is also important to consider since students accessing these documents may be under stressful conditions like application processes for colleges and universities abroad. In such a situation, this technology could act as an unnecessary hindrance. Another factor to consider here is since the technology is being used on children whose appearance is bound to undergo changes over the course of the time since when the picture in the CBSE repository was taken and when the student is trying to access it, this technology could fail to identify students thereby adding to the stress that children may already be undergoing.\nOur recommendation In lights of these concerns, we recommended that CBSE cease use of facial recognition irrespective of the nomenclature being used for it as face matching for any of its deployments.\nProject Panoptic Under our Project Panoptic, we try to bring transparency and accountability to all facial recognition deployments by the government, both State and Central across the country.

The petition challenged the Central Information Commisison’s refusal to grant Mr. Das a hearing prior to disposing of his complaint based on the government\u0026rsquo;s misleading claim that the information sought by him regarding the creation of the Aarogya Setu app was already available in the public domain.\nBackground Since May 2020, RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das has been trying to obtain information about creation of the Aarogya Setu mobile app which was launched by the Indian government as a COVID-19 surveillance measure. The app has courted controversy due to the involvement of private sector volunteers in its development and its mandatory nature. Compared to international best practices, the Aarogya Setu app adopts a centralized model and it collects a large amount of health and location data of its users. These features of Aarogya Setu have led to concerns about misuse of personal data collected by the app for commercial and law enforcement purposes.\nThrough his RTI work, Mr. Das has managed to uncover information about the Aarogya Setu app which shows that its current functioning does not comply with provisions of the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol. However, there is still a lot of information about the creation of the app which is not available to the public. For this reason, Mr. Das had filed several RTIs with the relevant government authorities and sought a copy of the entire file relating to Aarogya Setu which would contain information about the origin of the proposal, people and government departments involved, correspondence between private sector executives and government officials, file notings, minutes of meetings etc.\nShockingly, after keeping Mr. Das waiting for over three months, the Public Information Officers of the National Informatics Centre (which built the App), the National e Governance Division (responsible for e-gov projects) and the Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (which owns the App) all claimed that information relating to Aarogya Setu is not held by their respective departments.\nProceedings before the CIC On 10 September 2020, Mr. Das filed a complaint before the Central Information Commission (CIC) because the relevant government authorities were claiming ignorance about Aarogya Setu. An urgent hearing was held before the CIC on 22 October 2020 because the CIC recognized that this issue could affect the privacy of millions of Indians during the COVID-19 pandemic and irreversible harm would be caused if the usual wait time of 2 years was insisted upon.\nDuring the hearing on 22 October 2020, the CIC heard Mr. Das\u0026rsquo;s submissions about the conduct of government officials who were providing evasive responses about Aarogya Setu to frustrate RTI applicants. When questioned by the CIC, Public Information Officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC could not explain which government department held all information related to creation of Aarogya Setu. In its interim order, the CIC held that denial of information by government authorities in such a manner could not be accepted and while files may move between departments, \u0026ldquo;a citizen cannot go round in circles to find out the custodian.\u0026quot;\nThe CIC held a show cause hearing in the matter on 24 November 2020 but Mr. Das was not granted permission to attend the hearing despite multiple requests. In his absence, the CIC issued a final order uncritically accepting the government\u0026rsquo;s claim that the information sought by Mr. Das was already available in the public domain. Subsequent to the final order being issued, the government authorities shared certain documents with Mr. Das which were already available in the public domain but which did not answer the specific queries in his RTI application.\nWrit Petition before Delhi High Court On 17 December 2020, we filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court on behalf of Mr. Das challenging the CIC’s refusal to grant him a hearing prior to passing the final order which incorrectly disposed of his complaint and dropped the show cause proceedings against the Public Information Officers. The petition was listed today before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Pratibha Singh who issued notice to the government and sought specific details about the documents supplied to Mr. Das and whether they actually answer the queries in his RTI application.\nDuring the hearing, Advocate Vrinda Bhandari advanced oral arguments on behalf of Mr. Das and explained the timeline of the case to highlight how he had been kept waiting since May 2020 due to the evasive conduct of government officials. She also distinguished the judgements relied upon by the Respondents and clarified that the CIC should have at least heard the Petitioner to determine whether there was a default by the Public Information Officers even if he was not provided a hearing at the time of determination of quantum of penalty. She emphasized that if the Petitioner had been present during the show cause hearing, he could have rebutted the government’s claim that all information sought by him was available in the public domain and prevented the CIC from being misled.\nIn response, the Government Counsel maintained that all relevant information was available in the public domain and it had been supplied to the Petitioner. He further justified the delay and lack of coordination among different government departments regarding Aarogya Setu by stating that the app had been developed in record time without spending a single penny amidst a war-like situation where the priority was saving lives.\nRecognizing that the case involves contested issues of fact, Justice Singh directed both sides to submit a chart clearly comparing the information which had been sought by Mr. Das with information supplied by the government authorities. She also observed that the main concern was the merits of the case and expeditiously deciding the matter since the Petitioner had been seeking this information since May 2020.\nIFF provided legal assistance to Mr. Das for this petition and he was represented in court today by Advocates Vrinda Bhandari, Sanjana Srikumar, N. Sai Vinod and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay. The matter has been listed next on 24 February 2020 and we will keep you updated about the case proceedings.\nImportant Links  Writ Petition filed on behalf of Saurav Das (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;Govt officials to justify denial of information about Aarogya Setu in secret hearing before CIC\u0026rsquo; dated 23.11.2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/delhi-hc-hearing-aarogya-setu/","summary":"Today, the Delhi HC issued notice to the CPIOs of DeitY, MeitY, NeGD and NIC in a petition filed by RTI activist, Saurav Das, challenging denial of information relating to the creation of the Aarogya Setu app.","title":"Delhi HC issues notice to govt in petition challenging denial of RTI  regarding Aarogya Setu  #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  Tl;dr On the 1st of January, 2021, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare notified the Unique Health Identifier Rules, 2021. Given that the Prime Minister had mentioned the use of these new health IDs in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, we thought we would create an explainer on the Rules. This explainer is our initial attempt at an analysis of the Health ID framework, through which we hope to contribute to an evidence and fact lead public discussion on the use of digital technology in public health.\nWhat is the Unique Health Identifier\nThe Unique Health Identifier (UHID) is a unique ID that is issued by the Centre for the purpose of “identification and authentication of beneficiaries in various health IT applications”. The UHID is meant to help facilitate the “integration of health data across various applications and create longitudinal Electronic Health Records for citizens”, while also aiding the Ministry of Health with de-duplication.\nThe Unique Health identifier Rules, 2021 were notified on January 1st, 2021. The Rules contain 6 provisions dealing with the Health ID. Rule 2 states that voluntary Aadhaar based verification shall be used to create Unique Health identifiers. Rule 3 allows entities to provide voluntary Aadhaar based authentication for the creation of a UHID. Rule 4 designates the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to be the Authentication User Agency/ KYC User Agency for Aadhar authentication services for Health IT applications. Lastly, Rules 5 and 6 expand on the voluntary nature of Aadhaar based verification by disallowing the denial of health services due to the non-provision of Aadhaar and allowing the Ministry of Health and family Welfare to specify alternative documents for the creation of a UHID.\nUnder the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), Aadhaar based verification will be used to authenticate UHIDs on a voluntary basis. Details to be collected include:\n Health Data - Diagnostic reports, discharge summaries, clinical notes, prescriptions, immunisation records Personal Data - Name, age, sex, household size, Aadhaar Sensitive Personal Data - Financial information, Sex life, Sexual orientation, Biometric data, Genetic data, Transgender status, Intersex status, Caste or tribe, Religious or political belief or affiliation  What are its legislative and policy origins?\n   Document Recommendations/provisions     Aadhaar Act, 2016 Subclause (ii) of clause (b) of sub-section (4) of section 4 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 allows Aadhaar based authentication for purposes prescribed by the Central Government   Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020 Allows Aadhaar based verification in the interest of good governance, prevention of leakage of public funds, promoting ease of living of citizens, and enabling better access to services   NDHM’s Health Data Management Policy Drafted for the protection of individuals’/data principal’s personal digital health data privacy in the rollout of the UHID, and sets guidelines and standards for dealing collected therein   NDHM’s Strategy Overview Chapter 2 mentions the creation of Health IDs to standardise the identification process across healthcare providers   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s National Digital Health Blueprint Section 2.7 delineated the proposed usage of UHIDs to authenticate persons and thread medical records across multiple service providers    What are the proposed objectives of the UHID?\nAs a part of the NDHM, the UHID will help “ to liberate citizens from the challenges of finding the right doctors, seeking appointment with them, payment of consultation fee, making several rounds of hospitals for prescription sheets, among several others and will empower all Indians with the correct information and sources enabling them to take an informed decision to avail the best possible healthcare”. The authentication process will help the government correctly identify beneficiaries of public health schemes and remove duplicates from existing records.\nWhat is public opinion on the issue?\nPublic health groups such as the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan have registered their criticism of the Health ID. Several issues have been highlighted, such as the carte blanche provided for any entity to collect health data, the commoditisation of sensitive data such as health data, and the foisting of yet another document upon the citizenry for accessing basic public services.\nFrom a global regulatory perspective, an EU study has shown that health data can be secured only in the presence of a strong data protection law - something that India currently lacks. The European Patients Forum has also argued for safeguards to prevent the distribution of medical data being in a manner that promotes discrimination or stigam by employers and/or insurers. Finally, an international study that compared health identifier frameworks across several OECD frameworks found that, “strong governance controls must be in place with clear lines of accountability prior to any implementation of a UHI”, and that, “broad ranging stakeholder engagement is required early on in the project to ensure representation from all parties involved”.\nSensitive Personal Health Data put to risk\nThe fundamental concern is that of the need to protect user privacy. While the usage of Aadhar has prima facie been made voluntary, the framing of the rules, especially when read along with the National Digital Health Mission Policy, do seem to make Aadhaar the cornerstone of the Health IDs. Many questions with respect to digital security and privacy have already been raised with respect to Aadhaar. These issues are only exacerbated by the lack of a data protection legislation.\nWithout a data protection legislation, any guidelines for the processing of data and any safeguards for the protection of privacy may not be adequately enforceable, further increasing the risk of data abuse. The categories of data that may be collected are also a cause for consternation. Given that the Rules enable the collection of information about sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and political beliefs, it has been argued that such data may be used for profiling and surveillance of citizens.\nSecondly, given the sensitive nature of health data, the involvement of the private sector must be examined. Financial incentives may override the need for a just and open consent-sharing mechanism, while the sensitive data may be used in an exploitative manner by private entities for commercial purposes to, say, increase insurance premiums. Once again, the lack of a data protection legislation is key, as adequate safeguards for protecting against function creep and surveillance do not currently exist. Given the wide definition of data fiduciaries mentioned in the Health Data Management Policy, a wide variety of private entities, such as colony wellness centres, would be able to collect Health data through the Health ID which would only increase the potential scope of citizen profiling.\nFurthermore, the usage of Aadhaar authentication by private entities during the processing of health ID may contravene the Supreme Court’s judgement in Justice K.S.Puttaswamy(Retd) vs Union Of India, 2018, which held the authentication of Aadhaar by private entities to be unconstitutional. The judges denied the use of Aadhaar authentication pursuant to a contract, which has been argued to mean that any instance of Aadhaar authentication by private entities is not permissible.\nBeyond Privacy: practical, on-ground implementation harms\n Voluntary is now mandatory: Even though the use of Aadhaar has been made voluntary and the denial of health services has been denied, the potential for both exclusion and coercion still exists. This stems from two causes: firstly, the nature of aadhaar based verification, and secondly, the ambiguous nature of the Health ID and whether it is mandatory or not, especially since media reports have indicated that it might be the former. Perverse incentives and exclusionary systems: Citizens, especially those belonging to the working class or marginalised groups, may thus fail to receive benefits due to the well documented failures of Aadhaar based verification in other contexts. In the context of healthcare, the impact of Aadhaar can be seen in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). At AIIMS, if a patient provides their Aadhaar ID they can get the registration charges of Rs. 100 waved off. Such patients are then subsequently issued a Health ID. Such a policy not only significantly privileges the usage of AADHAAR (and thus effectively amounts to financial coercion towards the adoption of the Health ID), it also may exacerbate Aadhaar authentication issues. Operational confusion and denial of health services: Additionally, in September there were reports that all staffers in a government hospital in Chandigarh were mandated to create Health IDs under the NDHM. While the CEO of the National Health Authority later clarified that the order was a “wrong circular”, such events have contributed to fears that the health ID may be made permanent and thus force patients to provide their consent for sharing their data to receive the healthcare services.  Recommendations\nIn light of the above, here are a few suggestions to address these issues:\n Clearly identifying the need, purpose and safeguards for electronic medical records: It has been argued that since the medical community is still divided over the impact of digital health records on clinical outcomes, there is a need to comprehensively study the same in the context of efficacy and privacy concerns. Lessons from studies from other countries may also be beneficial. For example, a survey of general physicians in Australia found that they accessed only a tiny fraction of all the reports uploaded onto the database. To this extent, the government must also hold consultations with diverse stakeholders to calibrate this framework towards a focus on improving medical outcomes (rather than on data collection). Hence, a transparent, consultative approach with public health groups, independent academics and experts, digital rights organisations needs to be conducted on priority. Withdrawal of Aadhaar based authentication: Aadhaar is a system that will lead to greater data collection and purposeless surveillance, exclusions and even potential frauds**.** Given the multifarious issues detailed above, the usage of Aadhaar for the purpose of authentication must be withdrawn. Public health groups have already been vocal about the imposition of yet another ID (that would effectively become compulsory for those who rely on publicly financed healthcare services). Thus, even if the health ID framework is to be retained, the removal of aadhaar-based verification would ensure that issues related to privacy are at the very least partially addressed. Hence, the Unique Health Identifier Rules, 2021 should be recalled or at the very least kept in abeyance till public processes for consultation, feedback and feasibility assessments and a legal scrutiny can be put towards them.  As mentioned earlier, this blog and the explainer mark our initial attempt to understand the issues surrounding the Unique Health Identifier Rules and start a conversation on the same. If you have any comments on the Rules or on our work on the issue, please do let us know here.\nImportant Documents  An explainer on the Unique Health Identifier rules, 2021 (link) The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) National Digital Health Mission\u0026rsquo;s Health Data Management Policy (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/health-id-rules-explainer/","summary":"Given that the proposed health IDs are to be used in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, we thought we would create an explainer on the the Unique Health Identifier Rules, 2021.

In our comments, we raised four concerns that we felt needed to be addressed: firstly, that the definition of non-personal data provided contains significant ambiguities and is based on an unconstitutional approach; secondly, that the risks surrounding de-anonymisation haven’t been adequately addressed; thirdly, that the proposed framework may lead to data maximisation, monopoly formation, and the exploitation of citizens; and, lastly, that the consultation process may be becoming superficial and opaque.\nFrameworks for the governance of non-personal data The Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data (NPD) Governance Framework had released its draft report on a governance framework for NPD for publication consultation, on which we had provided our comments. On the basis of feedback from the public, the Committee revised its report and released a second version, on which comments have been invited till January 31st, 2021.\nThe second version of the draft report largely toes the line of the first version. It defines NPD as data which is not personal data as defined in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB) or which does not contain personally identifiable information. Thus, NPD would either be data that does not originate from persons (such as weather data, industrial machinery data), or personal data that has been anonymised. It is the latter that must be focused upon, since it is likely that it would comprise the majority of NPD.\nThe draft report envisions a clean separation between NPD and personal data. It puts the regulation of NPD outside the ambit of the Data Protection Authority envisioned by the PDPB, and even sets up a parallel authority, the Non-Personal Data Authority, with a radically different function to that of the Data Protection Authority - the promotion of NPD for commercial purposes. The report even goes so far as to ask for an amendment to the PDPB, arguing for the removal of certain clauses that would allow the PDPB to regulate NPD - only if NPD is de-anonymised would it fall under the jurisdiction of the PDPB.\nA new classification of business called ‘Data Business’ is proposed. Subject to certain thresholds, registration as a data business would not be compulsory. Data business would allow access through data-sharing frameworks not only to meta-data datasets for commercial purposes, but also to certain ‘High Value Datasets’, subject to some perfunctory community rights of the data. A request to create a ‘High Value Data’ can come from any entity - for example, as noted in the report itself, a dataset “on diabetes among Indian citizens” can be circulated with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare acting as a data trustee.\nWhat are the issues? Firstly, the report provides an extremely broad definition of NPD by defining it in opposition to personal data as defined in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB). As we had indicated in our previous submission, issues arise in the context of both implementation and jurisprudence when trying to ascertain whether a given piece of data is ‘personal’ or ‘non-personal’. The proposed relationship between the PDPB and the NPD framework may also not adequately address concerns about privacy and data security. It is shocking that the 9 judge bench holding of the Supreme Court in the Puttaswamy judgment on the fundamental right to Privacy is not even considered or reasoned by the Draft Report in its Second Version. This is an anti-constitutional approach that we find extremely worrying.\nSecondly, as the report itself has noted, the threat of de-anonymization is a grave one against which adequate barriers must be maintained. Given that a large portion of NPD will consist of anonymised personal data, it is vital that such issues be dealt with. The relative ease of de-anonymization has already been highlighted in various contexts, while the situation in India is worsened by the lack of adequate data protection legislation. It is an unwise and faulty approach to consider de-anonymization as only a potential risk when the provisions of the second version of the report envisage the expropriation of data from private enterprises at scale that will vary in quality, scope, type and frequency.\nThirdly, the proposed version of the governance framework may enable data maximisation, wherein there is overreach in data collection by various entities. Besides the natural issues related to consent, the economic rationale given to bolster the claim that a profusion of data generation and conclusion may not hold up, and may instead lead to the exploitation of citizens. This revolts against the increasingly standard principle of by design in global data protection legislations which focus on data minimisation through purpose limitation. Additionally, as we had also pointed out in our previous submission, the report fails to substantially engage with concerns about data monopolies and market failure, and does not adequately consider competition law.\nLastly, the functioning and the outputs of the present committee and the draft report are severely problematic and stray from several healthy precedents on public consultations and transparency adopted by the Ministry of Electronics and IT. While the present version of the draft report does mention consultations with stakeholders from civil society, information about the scope, extent and nature of these consultations is largely unavailable. Furthermore, the proceedings of the Committee have engendered questions about whether such consultations have had merely a perfunctory nature. The response to an RTI filed by us failed to provide any information on the workings of the Committee. Thus, it would seem that the approach adopted in releasing a second version is towards incremental changes rather than substantively addressing the substantive issues, concerns and faulty premises adopted within the proposals. Tackling such issues is vital, as even if there is disagreement it requires reasoning and compliance with constitutional principles.\nRecommendations Our broader recommendation, given the serious issues that plague the proposed framework, is to disband the committee, recall the draft report, and allow NPD to be regulated under the Data Protection Authority proposed by the PDPB. Doing so would shift the focus onto the protection of citizens’ digital rights and ensure robust regulatory mechanisms for NPD. Questions about the fostering of growth in the sector can then be handled in consonance with an approach that safeguards user data.\nAt a more granular level, we proposed that the NPD be regulated by the Data Protection Authority. This would strengthen institutional independence, reduce confusion and minimise the potential risks and faulty premises adopted by the second version of the Draft Non-Personal Data Report. This also becomes necessary in light of issues of the ease of de-anonymisation, since a proactive approach in which robust guidelines for anonymisation procedures are mandated and enforced (in addition to any retroactive procedures) may be better equipped to deal with the emerging threats posed by de-anonymisation.\nSubsequently, the Data Protection Authority must junk an approach that directly enables the over extraction of data and the formation of data monopolies, and create a model that centre the governance framework around the protection of user privacy, based on the Puttaswamy judgement on the Fundamental Right to Privacy. Finally, opacities in the consultation process must be cleared, and further information about the proceedings of the committee and the consultations held must be provided to increase transparency.\nImportant Documents  Second version of the Draft Report of the Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s submission on the second version of the Draft Report (link) RTI request dated August 20, 2020 and reply received (link) First Appeal dated October 30, 2020 and FAA decision (link) Submission on the first version of the Draft Non-Personal Data Report dated September 13, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/unconstitutional-draft-report-on-non-personal-data-ignores-concerns-about-privacy-and-data-monopolies/","summary":"IFF submitted its comments on the second version of the Draft Report by the Committee of Experts on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework and raised four main concerns that we felt needed to be addressed.","title":"Unconstitutional draft report on non-personal data ignores concerns about privacy and data monopolies"},{"content":"  As we start to slowly move towards a “new normal”, we are gearing up for new work patterns to operate and raise money.

The new privacy policy confirms that Facebook may now have access to messages shared with businesses on WhatsApp and it provides more insight into expansive meta data collection by WhatsApp. The latest changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy cement the problematic status quo which has existed since the privacy policy was first updated in 2016. The changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy in 2016 are also the subject of pending litigation before the Supreme Court of India in Karmanya Singh Sareen v. Union of India, where IFF is an intervenor. __\nBackground WhatsApp is currently witnessing a mass exodus of privacy concerned users after it released an in-app notification forcing users to accept its revised privacy policy by 08 February 2021 or stop using its service entirely. However, this is not the first time WhatsApp has changed its privacy policy to facilitate sharing of data with its parent company, Facebook. To understand what is happening, we must rewind the clock and take ourselves back to February 2014 when WhatsApp was first acquired by Facebook for USD 22 billion.\nWhen Facebook was considering acquiring WhatsApp, privacy activists read the writing on the wall and warned about potential data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook. To allay these concerns, executives from WhatsApp publicly committed to never share data with Facebook. Based on these assurances, regulators such as the European Commission and the Federal Trade Commission greenlit the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook.\nVolte Face in 2016 Fast forward to August 2016, WhatsApp announced that it would start sharing some data with Facebook including phone numbers and last seen activity. At that time, WhatsApp stated that the changes in its privacy policy would allow Facebook to offer better friend suggestions and more relevant ads to its users. Users were given 30 days to opt-out of sharing data with Facebook for ad targeting purposes but if they failed to exercise that option within 30 days, they would have no choice but to consent to data sharing. Any new users who joined after August 2016 would also not have the choice to opt out of sharing data with Facebook.\nThe regulators who had approved Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp based on its commitments about preserving user privacy did not take to this volte face kindly. In 2017, the European Commission fined Facebook 110 million Euros for providing misleading information during the WhatsApp acquisition about its technical inability to link the identities of users across WhatsApp and Facebook. Prior to this in 2016 itself, data protection authorities in Germany and the United Kingdom also directed Facebook to stop collecting data of WhatsApp users.\nLegal Proceedings in India The changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy in August 2016 became the subject of litigation before the Delhi High Court in Karmanya Singh Sareen \u0026amp; Anr. v. Union of India \u0026amp; Ors. [W.P. (C) No. 7663 of 2016]. In a judgement delivered on 23 September 2016, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court declined to grant the reliefs sought by the petitioners which included a complete and meaningful opt-out option for users even beyond the initial 30 days. A Special Leave Petition was filed by the petitioners before the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court’s order and IFF is also an intervenor in these proceedings.\nDuring the course of hearings before the Supreme Court in Karmanya Singh Sareen \u0026amp; Anr. v. Union of India \u0026amp; Ors. [S.L.P. (C) No. 804 of 2017], IFF has advanced arguments about the need to preserve privacy of meta data even if the actual content of messages is encrypted. Meta data means data which describes or gives information about other data, and it includes information like which users do you chat with, how frequently do you chat with a user, which groups you are a member of etc. In many cases, meta data by itself can reveal very sensitive information about a person’s life. For instance, consider conversations with sexual and reproductive health services which now provide abortion related counselling via WhatsApp.\nThe case is still pending before the Supreme Court and it was last listed in March 2020 but it did not come up for hearing. You can read more about the history of the case here.\nLatest Changes to the Privacy Policy The latest changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy cement the problematic status quo which has existed since the privacy policy was first changed in 2016. As TechCrucnch explained back in 2016, Facebook is particularly keen to collect phone numbers of users through WhatsApp because it cannot do so through its own service. An individual can make a Facebook account by just using an email ID but providing one’s phone number is necessary to create a WhatsApp account. Therefore, phone numbers are the final piece of the puzzle in building a 360 degree profile of users, and linking identities across both platforms would certainly enhance Facebook’s ability to influence the behaviour of its users through personalized and targeted advertising. This explanation seems plausible especially in light of Facebook’s unsavoury track record of using phone numbers shared by individuals for security purposes like 2 factor authentication for advertising.\nAccording to a statement by WhatsApp, the main change introduced by the new privacy policy released on 04 January 2021 is clarifying that “going forward businesses can choose to receive secure hosting services from our parent company Facebook to help manage their communications with their customers on WhatsApp.” This means that Facebook may now have access to messages that users share with businesses on WhatsApp. This has been admitted by Facebook and the company claims that it “will not automatically use messages to inform the ads that a user sees” but “businesses will be able to use chats they receive for their own marketing purposes, which may include advertising on Facebook.” Considering Facebook’s past record on privacy, we will let you decide whether these assurances can be trusted.\nIn addition to this, the new privacy policy also confirms expansive data collection by WhatsApp, which is evident from the following:\n The new policy provides more details about the usage and log information and device and connection information collected by WhatsApp which demonstrate the highly invasive and granular nature of meta data collection by WhatsApp. For instance, the updated policy clarifies that WhatsApp is also collecting information like battery levels and signal strength. The new policy reveals that even if a user does not use their location-relation features, WhatsApp collects their IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate general location (city, country). The new policy states that for users of their payment service, WhatsApp will start processing payment account and transaction information which includes information about payment method, shipping details and transaction amount.  What\u0026rsquo;s the worst part? There is no option to users, except to click on, “I Agree.” If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to give in, we suggest you consider switching to a more secure platform like Signal and also join us in pushing for enactment of a strong data protection legislation in India.\nImportant Documents  WhatsApp Privacy Policy dated 04 January 2021 (link) Previous post regarding Karmanya Singh Sareen v.

Proctoring technology uses AI powered algorithms and tools to keep a check on candidates during online exams. Firstly, proctoring technology uses facial recognition to verify the student’s identity through 1:1 identification. Further, it surveils and records not only the surrounding audio of the student taking the online exam, who has to ensure that there is no noise in the background, but also monitors changes in their line of sight while capturing continuous photographs at intervals of about 15 to 20 seconds, which can amount to 200 to 240 images in an hour. In addition to this, the proctoring technology also continuously monitors all ongoing activity on the student’s screen. According to various reports, this technology is being used in various forms at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Delhi Technological University, O.P. Jindal Global University, Sonipat, SRM University, Chennai, Mumbai University and IIT-Bombay to name a few.\nWhy are we concerned? A. It is a highly invasive technology. In addition to being highly invasive as can be seen above, use of this highly invasive technology has led to higher levels of stress and anxiety in students who have already been one of the worst affected groups in the pandemic. The constant threat of being flagged by the technology for a perceived wrongful action in addition to the stress of the exam being given leads to a student having heightened anxiety levels. Here, it is worth mentioning that even while being highly invasive this technology is not fool-proof with multiple viral videos online on how to cheat such proctoring technology.\nB. Multiple privacy concerns arise. Proctoring technology gathers and retains invasive biometric data as well as personally identifiable information (PII) to determine the student’s identity and whether the student is cheating. It collects data such as full name, date of birth, address, phone number, scans of government-issued identity documents, educational institution affiliation, and student ID numbers. Additionally, they also gather information on the devices being used by the student such as records of operating systems, make and model of the device, as well as device identification numbers, IP addresses, browser type and language settings, software on the device and their versions, ISP, records of URLs visited, and how long students remain on a particular site or webpage.\nIn addition to this data which they gather, they also generate additional data which includes records of gaze or line of sight tracking, records of surrounding audio and records of the continuous video surveillance of the student including almost 200 to 240 photographs which the technology takes at regular intervals throughout the exam. While such gathering and retaining of data is objectively harmful, the harms are increased in India where we do not currently have a data protection law in place to ensure the data privacy of students. Here, it is also worth mentioning that minors are given a higher standard of protection in most data protection regimes across the world.\nAs per the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1) any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution must conform to certain thresholds. These thresholds are legality, necessity, proportionality and procedural safeguards which the universities have failed to meet.\nC. Other technical issues may affect candidature or outcome of exam. Circumstances which are out of the control of the student may end up having an adverse effect on their candidature under the watchful eyes of the proctoring technology. No person can ensure complete silence in his/her surroundings while taking an exam in a residential setting. Additionally, technological issues in the devices being used can arise unexpectedly which cannot be controlled by the student taking the exam. Lastly, technical glitches may be present in the proctoring technology itself, as has been reported by students of various universities which are deploying proctoring technology obtained from an EdTech Startup called CodeTantra.\nInternet connectivity which is fast, reliable and affordable is one of the main requirements of proctoring technology however it is still a sensitive issue in India with many remote areas still not having access to the internet as well as the ongoing internet shutdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which limits access to only 2G internet.\nOur recommendations In light of the above concerns, we wrote to the UGC and to the Ministry of Education with the following recommendations:\n Issue a directive halting the use of proctoring technology by universities to conduct online examinations. Issue detailed guidelines on how online examinations should be conducted while ensuring necessary privacy protections are put in place as per the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (Right to Privacy Judgement).

The Survey revealed that, while internet penetration in the country is rising, a persistent digital divide still remains due to factors such as gender gaps and the rural-urban divide.\nState of access to digital infrastructure As of 2019, out of 5,97,618 inhabited villages, 5,69,897 are covered by mobile services. Furthermore, 1,50,029 gram panchayats have been connected by the BharatNet Project, out of which 1,36,693 have been made service ready. As per TRAI’s Yearly Performance Indicators Report for 2019, India had 718.74 million internet subscribers as of 31st December 2019, an increase of 18.95% over the 604.21 million subscribers in 2018. Internet subscriptions in rural India amounted to 268.43 million - about 60% of the total of internet subscriptions in urban India, 450.21 million. As was widely expected, Indians access the internet overwhelmingly (96%) through mobile devices.\nThe Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators report for April – June, 2020 showed that in June 2020, the number of internet subscribers increased to 749.07 million, a 0.79% increase over the previous quarter, and a 4.2% increase over December 2019. The number of urban and rural subscribers increased to 455.98 million and 293.09 million respectively. The least number of internet subscriptions were in Himachal Pradesh (6.08 million), Jammu and Kashmir (7.50 million), and the North East service area (7.53 million). Overall internet tele-density (the number of internet subscribers per 100 persons) increased to 55.41 (2.1% increase from December 2019), with rural and urban internet tele-densities at 33.00 and 98.35 respectively (10.6% and -7.4% change respectively with respect to December 2019).\nThe table below displays the monthly growth of broadband subscribers in 2020 based on TRAI’s monthly subscription reports.\n  \u0026ldquo;Internet Broadband (≥ 512 Kbps download speed) in 2020\u0026rdquo;\n  Gaps in availability persist Thus, while the data does show that on the whole access to digital infrastructure is increasing, significant digital disparities still remain. These figures highlight the rural-urban divide in terms of access to the internet, with the number of rural subscribers, despite making up a significant majority of the population, being only 64% of the number of urban subscribers. Rural internet density is also at about a third of urban internet density. Clearly, large strides must still be made to reduce rural-urban differentials.\nOther imbalances are also visible. The stark gender based polarities in access to internet service can be seen through data compiled from the National Family Health Survey by Indiaspend. Their report indicates that in eight states and two union territories - Bihar (20.6%), Andhra Pradesh (21.0%), Tripura (22.9%), West Bengal (25.5%), Telangana (26.5%), Assam (28.2%), Gujarat (30.8%), Meghalaya (34.7%), Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (34.8%), Karnataka (35.0%), and Dadra \u0026amp; Nagar Haveli and Daman \u0026amp; Diu (36.7%) - less than 40 percent women have used the internet. Comparatively, in the same states, more than 40% men have used the internet. In only three states and one union territory did more than 50% women from rural areas acknowledge to have used the internet - Goa (%), Kerala (57.5%), Sikkim (68.1%), and Ladakh (54%).\nMeanwhile, there were only 6 states and 1 union territory - Meghalaya (42.1%), Assam (42.3%), Bihar (43.6%), Tripura (45.7%), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (46.5%), West Bengal (46.7%), and Andhra Pradesh (48.8%) - in which less than 50% of the men had used the internet. Even in states with low overall internet penetration such as Bihar, the percentage of women who have used the internet was less than half of that of men.\nFurthermore, these figures do not help in providing a full picture. The survey only measured if a person had ever used the internet, and did not collect details about the availability of internet services or the regularity of their usage. Thus, while the survey shows awareness about the internet, it does not necessarily cover the actual usage of the internet, and so actual digital divides may be larger.\nEvidence from the field Conversations we\u0026rsquo;ve had with people have also revealed that even where improvements are taking place, several impediments and disruptions plague service delivery. Consider the case of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In June last year, issues with internet access in the islands were brought to our notice. Subsequently, we helped the people of the islands write to the PMO, the DoT and to MP Kuldeep Rai Sharma. These efforts bore fruit in August, when the Prime Minister inaugurated the Chennai and Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project.\nRecently, we decided to speak to stakeholders in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands we\u0026rsquo;d reached out to earlier. They said that while some baseline level of access had indeed been established, several problems remained. One significant issue seemed to be the exorbitant tariff rates, as even the best plan ( that anyways delivered a slow-to-medium speed at a monthly data cap) would cost 2-3 times the tariff for 5G unlimited plans in other areas of the country. In an economy devastated by the pandemic, this has led to many people discontinuing their internet connections. The connection has also been erratic, with some people reporting multiple days without the internet. Lastly, there have been informal reports about the government planning to shift the burden of providing high speed internet onto private companies. Stakeholders indicated that such a move might prove to be detrimental, since private telecom service providers would be more likely to shift the high entry costs onto the users.\nSteps taken Ultimately, efforts to improve and expand India\u0026rsquo;s digital infrastructure must be ramped up. Such a task has been made paramount due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has, in all likelihood, increased inequalities in access to the internet. In this light, the Department of Telecommunications' PM WANI scheme seems to be a good move prima facie. The scheme aims to set up public wifi hotspots throughout the country in a decentralised manner through Public Data Offices which provide wifi services locally. We will put out an explainer describing and analysing the scheme in the coming days.\nImportant Documents  IndiaSpend\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026lsquo;4 In 5 Bihar Women Have Never Used The Internet\u0026rsquo; (link) Representation to PMO and DoT on the CANI Project in Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands for 4G Internet Access dated June 26, 2020 (link) Letter to Shri Kuldeep Rai Sharma on the CANI Project dated July 25, 2020 (link) Representation to the DoT on Internet Access issues in Odisha dated September 8, 2020 (link)  _* This post was written with significant contributions from Anushree Verma, a 3rd year student of law at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad._\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/on-chronic-inequalities-in-internet-access/","summary":"Data from the 5th NFHS survey indicates that while internet access is increasing, a significant digital divide remains as a result of issues such as gender gaps and rural-urban gaps.

In its response to the petition, Indian Kanoon has clarified that such a right cannot be judicially created without a law being enacted by Parliament and emphasized that court records are public documents whose reproduction cannot be prohibited by citing the right to privacy.\nBackground Indian Kanoon is a popular website which provides the general public access to court judgements and legislations in an easily searchable format free of cost. The website celebrated its 13th birthday yesterday and it has democratised access to the law in India. The court orders which are available on Indian Kanoon are automatically scrapped and reproduced from the websites of the Supreme Court, High Courts, district courts and tribunals. Indian Kanoon does not edit or remove any court orders from its website except for redaction of personally identifiable details of victims of sexual violence. You can read Indian Kanoon\u0026rsquo;s case removal policy here.\nIn October 2020, a writ petition was filed before the Kerala High Court seeking removal of a court order available on the Indian Kanoon website by claiming a right to be forgotten. The Petitioner has objected to reproduction of the bail order by claiming that he was subsequently acquitted in the case, and therefore, the bail order has become \u0026ldquo;outdated, irrelevant, inadequate and excessive.\u0026quot; The Petitioner has also claimed that the bail order incorrectly states the crime number of the case filed against him at the police station.\nThe writ petition attempts to draw its legal basis from the landmark 2017 judgement of the Supreme Court in _K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India _ which recognized a fundamental right to privacy under the Indian Constitution. It also references the 2014 judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Union in _Google Spain v. AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonzalez _ which held that citizens of member states of the European Union could seek removal of links containing their personal information from search results if such search results are inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in the light of the time that had elapsed.\nIndian Kanoon\u0026rsquo;s Response In its counter-affidavit, Indian Kanoon has explained that there is no legal basis for the reliefs being sought by the Petitioner for the following reasons.\nFirst, court records are public documents and in R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court clearly held that the fundamental right to privacy cannot be used to prevent publication of court records. The Petitioner\u0026rsquo;s assertion that the decision in R. Rajagopal requires re-examination after the judgement in K.S. Puttaswamy is misconceived because the latter explicitly refers to and endorses the former in several paragraphs. Therefore, it is settled law that the right to privacy cannot be used to prevent publication of court orders.\nSecond, the only situations when the publication of a court order can be prevented are if the court specifically passes such an order itself or if there is a statutory prohibition against publication of certain types of orders. For instance, Section 228A of the Indian Penal Code prohibits disclosure of the identity of victims of sexual violence, and in light of this, Indian Kanoon redacts any personally identifiable details of victims of sexual violence which may be present in court orders published on its website.\nThreat to Freedom of Information By seeking judicial recognition of a right to be forgotten which is disconnected from any law enacted by Parliament, this Petition could open a can of worms and undermine freedom of speech and expression and the right to receive information guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The presence of a statutory framework ensures that censorship takes place only for legitimate reasons and with adherence to procedural safeguards. In its judgement in K.S. Puttaswamy, the Supreme Court also emphasized that it is the legislature which must create a statutory framework for data protection after carefully balancing the right to privacy with other rights such as free speech.\nIn fact, Clause 20 of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 deals with the right to be forgotten but till this issue is properly considered by Parliament, any judicial declaration of a right to be forgotten would be premature. It is important to appreciate that a right to be forgotten cannot be recognized in isolation and it requires the existence of a regulatory authority as well. For instance, the CJEU\u0026rsquo;s judgement in Google Spain was based on the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive and relied on the presence of a Data Protection Authority.\nIndian Kanoon is being represented in this case by Advocates Santhosh Mathew and Anil Sebastian Pulickel. IFF associated counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Sanjana Srikumar and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay have also provided drafting assistance to the legal team in this case.\nImportant Documents  Counter-affidavit filed by Indian Kanoon (link)   ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/indian-kanoon-kerala-hc-right-to-be-forgotten/","summary":"In response to a petition filed before the Kerala HC, Indian Kanoon has clarified that a right to be forgotten cannot be judicially created without a statutory basis and explained that court records are public documents whose reproduction cannot be prohibited by citing the right to privacy.","title":"Indian Kanoon defends the right to provide access to court records"},{"content":"  2020 has been a challenging year for IFF’s litigation team because the functioning of the Supreme Court and High Courts was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the nationwide lockdown was announced in March 2020, courts across the country shut down their physical premises and migrated to virtual hearings conducted through video conferencing. Virtual hearings have been marred by technical glitches and courts have been reluctant to conduct substantive hearings in regular matters which do not involve any urgency. However, threats to our civil liberties have only increased during this period with the government using the pandemic as an excuse to launch surveillance projects such as the Aarogya Setu app and the BECIL tracking tool for healthcare workers and patients.\nGrowing strategic litigation for digital rights Despite these challenges, we worked with highly skilled and accomplished litigators to provide pro-bono legal representation to nine organisations and individuals in 2020. The clients we have represented this year include but are not limited to:\n  Foundation for Media Professionals, a journalist body which challenged the 4G mobile internet ban in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. 4G mobile internet was finally restored in 2 out of 20 districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 16 August 2020 but a lot more remains to be done. (Read more)\n  Jackson Mathew, a businessman who challenged mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu in all public and private workplaces. After this petition was filed, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued revised guidelines clarifying that use of Aarogya Setu would only be required on a best-efforts basis. (Read more)\n  Environmental groups like Fridays For Future India, Let India Breathe and There Is No Planet B which faced website blocking for facilitating public participation in the consultation process for the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2020. After we sent legal notices to the relevant authorities on behalf of these groups, access to their websites was restored in the last week of July 2020. (Read more)\n  Doctor and disability rights activist, Dr. Satendra Singh, who challenged the exclusionary consultation process for the National Digital Health Mission Health Data Management Policy. After this petition was heard by the Delhi High Court, the consultation deadline was extended and alternative modes of submitting feedback by email or courier were provided. (Read more)\n  RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das, who was denied a hearing before the Central Information Commission in relation to this RTI seeking information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app. (Read more)\n  IFF also approached the Madras High Court itself as an intervenor in a PIL seeking censorship of online streaming platforms. (Read more)\n  Much more in store Litigation work often has a long gestation period and over the past two months, we have been working on several new cases which will be publicly disclosed in the coming weeks. The issues we have been working on include the 4G mobile internet ban in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which has crossed 500 days and attempts to judicially create a right to be forgotten in India. We would not like to over claim, but do wish to set out that pending and disposed cases have resulted in incremental and positive movement for digital rights. You can view our larger litigation docket right here on the substantive outcomes.\nThis has not happened due to our efforts in isolation and is to the credit of this entire sector – individuals, groups and organisations. More on that in the next section.\nBetter outcomes with the best litigators! Our litigation advocacy has been made possible through a framework of internal capacity and a network of pro bono lawyers who have generously devoted their time and energy to these cases. We are extremely grateful to the following litigators (in alphabetical order) for their support in 2020: Astha Sharma (Advocate on Record), Abhinav Sekhri, Angaj Gautam, Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Bharat Gupta, Gautam Bhatia, Huzefa Ahmadi (Senior Advocate), Jahnavi Sindhu, KV Viswanathan (Senior Advocate), Mukunda Rao, Nakul Dewan (Senior Advocate), Prateek Chadha (Advocate on Record), Rajasekhar Rao, Rahul Narayan (Advocate on Record), Ria Singh Sawhney, Shyam Divan (Senior Advocate), S. Prasanna, Sai Vinod, Santhosh Mathew, Shadan Farasat (Advocate on Record), Suhrith Parathasarathy and Surasika Parathasarathy. Many more lawyers have worked with us closely last year, we remain in gratitude towards their contributions towards building our strategic litigation vertical.\nLast but certainly not the least, IFF’s litigation vertical has been helmed by our Of Counsel, Vrinda Bhandari, Litigation Fellow, Sanjana Srikumar, and Litigation Counsel, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay, who have pulled many all nighters and worked through many weekends to ensure our small team can achieve its mighty goal of defending digital rights of Indian internet users. IFF’s Board Chair, Raman Chima, and Executive Director, Apar Gupta, have also been an indispensable part of our litigation team and our court centred interventions would not be possible or as impactful without their strategic guidance and assistance with stakeholder outreach.\nLooking towards next year We recognise that many people feel disillusioned by the judicial system but we believe that by adopting a strategy of incrementalism and iteration, it is still possible to achieve positive outcomes through litigation. This also helps us minismise the risk of setting precedent that despite the best intention, end up hurting rather than helping. Most importantly, the success of any court centered intervention often depends on public outreach, collaboration with experts, prior policy level enagagement and information gathering through RTIs, and we hope to continue following this multi-pronged advocacy model going forward in 2021.\nIFF plans to follow an integrated approach towards strategic litigation that advances our constitutional values.

By utilising the Right to Information Act, 2005 as well as by way of two data-driven projects, we have tried to bring accountability in the working of every public authority. These transparency efforts are towards ensuring that the gap between the public and public policy can be bridged and more people get to engage in processes that set the digital frameworks that govern their present and future.\nThe digital transparency initiative The RTI Act has helped us tremendously this year in uncovering important details about various actions taken by the Central and State governments throughout the year. It has lead to media reporting, informed commentary and better public feedback. Such good faith engagement helps evidence based policy making, increases the justification and reasoning for public policy processes. We are providing a breakdown in terms of numbers below.\n   Type of Application No. of Applications filed in 2020     Right to Information Requests 246   First Appeals 36   Second Appeals 5   Urgency Applications 5    Some highlights of the information we unearthed can be accessed below:\n RTI response reveals CCTV deployment by Chandigarh Police without legal safeguards. Delhi Police admits to using drones on civilians without any publicly available legal guidelines in place. A look at Aarogya Setu through the Right to Information lens. Licensed Service Area Units of the Department of Telecom sought bulk Call Data Records from Telecom Service Providers as per official documents revealed through RTI. RTI responses from MP and Meghalaya show compliance failure with the Anuradha Bhasin Internet Shutdown decision. RTI responses from Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat show compliance failure with the Anuradha Bhasin Internet Shutdown decision MEA\u0026rsquo;s RTI response on International Statement on E2E Encryption. The non-personal data policy process remains opaque and problematic.  Additionally, we also made our RTI resources available to various third party organisations who were unable to utilise these tools on their own due to various factors such as a high risk factor or lack of familiarity with the RTI platform. One such group of organisations are the environmental collectives whose websites were blocked by the Government who reached out to us for support.\nWe have already started a new practice of publishing a monthly RTI report to increase transparency around our transparency work. Read the report for the month of December, 2020 here! With your support this work will only grow next year.\nProject Panoptic In addition to utilising the RTI Act as a measure to increase transparency around various ongoing issues, this year we also harnessed it specifically to help us in building our facial recognition technology mapping project “Project Panoptic”. With the help of RTI requests (and also Registrar of Companies and Tendering data) as one of the fields of information, we were able to collate information on various ongoing facial recognition technology projects which we then showcased on the Panoptic platform to increase transparency around these projects and raise public awareness around this highly invasive technology.\n Illegal use of Facial Recognition for Voter Verification in Telangana. Illegal use of facial recognition technology by the Delhi Police akin to mass surveillance. Project Panoptic: Right to Information Updates from Delhi Police, Kolkata Police and Telangana State Technology Services  The project aims to build a digital public resource that is intended to aid transparency and accountability around the deployment of facial recognition in India. It will uncover information, analyse it and then present it through an interactive digital resource. Such a resource will be instrumental in assisting policy and legal advocacy as well as drive issue specific public campaigns.\nThis public resource will then be used to drive advocacy on the issue through campaigns and online advocacy. This will enable strategic litigation at the Central and State level by diverse individuals and collectives based on individual harms and injuries that may be suffered by them. The broader aim would be to drive policy changes particularly with regard to data protection legislation in India as well as the introduction of a specific sectoral legislation for facial recognition technology.\nThe Zombie Section 66A Tracker In addition utilising the RTI Act for furthering transparency, we have also worked throughout the year on data driven projects such as the Zombie Tracker which aims to raise awareness and demand accountability for the ongoing use of the unconstitutional S.66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. In March 2015, S.66A was declared unconstitutional by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union Of India (AIR 2015 SC 1523) as it violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A.\nHowever, a 2018 study, ‘Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies’, highlighted the continued use of S. 66A, including cases registered after the Shreya Singhal decision. To meet this challenge we have come up with a data driven, evidence based solution in partnership with CivicData Labs. We have worked in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system. This work done substantially through the course of 2020 will see an early 2021 release, hopefully in the month of January, 2021.\nDo you have suggestions on what we can do better?

This blog post is a quick review of all that we were able to achieve. We first attempt to show in numbers the consultations we participated in and move towards an impact break down in core thematic areas around informational privacy, free expression and innovation. Most of our work was the product of collaboration and working alongside diverse experts, groups and collectives. As we look towards next year we hope to further increase the spirit of collaboration and listen more to increase the impact of digital rights across the spectrum of individual liberty and social welfare.\nIn Numbers Over the course of the year, we participated in 11 consultations with governmental bodies. The topics under consultation included data protection legislation, internet access, net neutrality enforcement, and digital infrastructure among others. A full table of consultations can be found below.\n   Date Document     January 13, 2020 Cybersecurity Strategy 2020   February 28, 2020 Personal Data Protection Bill, 2020   March 03, 2020 TRAI consultation paper on net neutrality enforcement   March 20, 2020 Draft Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2020   July 07, 2020 Draft Unmanned Aircraft System (Drones) Rules, 2020   October 03, 2020 DoT paper on the Development of an Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack   October 20, 2020 TRAI\u0026rsquo;s Consultation Paper on Broadband Access and Connectivity   November 09, 2020 Draft Online Dispute Resolution Policy   November 19, 2020 Draft Data Centre Policy 2020   November 30, 2020 Draft Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture Policy   December 14, 2020 NITI Aayog\u0026rsquo;s draft Working Document: Enforcement Mechanisms for Responsible #AIforAll    Areas of Engagement Aarogya Setu : Just like 2020, our work this year also revolved a lot around COVID-19. We published a case study on technological interventions for COVID-19, and detailed public resistance towards and criticism of the Aarogya Setu app (see here, here, here and here). We also analysed the app in the context of the right to privacy and raised certain technical issues with the app and its documentation. In addition to this, we raised concerns over the mandatory imposition of the app (see here and here), while through RTIs we were able to go through government documents about Aarogya Setu. This completed wider efforts (on which we collaborated with close to 50 organisations) going beyond the mandatory and voluntary quagmire into Aarogya Setu\u0026rsquo;s core design and our strategic litigation in the Kerala High Court.\nData Protection Legislation : Under the flag of #SaveOurPrivacy we continued work to ensure a user centric data protection law. Our efforts included a representation on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 at the start of the year and provided a detailed explainer on the Bill and the various issues surrounding it. We also sent our detailed comments on the Bill to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill, along with several public briefs. We further discussed the need for incorporating safeguards for data security as well protections for cybersecurity researchers and whistleblowers. In addition to these, we wrote about both the consultation process itself and the working of the Joint Committee. Lastly, we provided an analysis of the National Population Register in the context of the Bill.\nInternet Access, Shutdowns and Net Neutrality: The year began with TRAI’s consultation paper on net neutrality enforcement (see here for our summary). We provided TRAI with comments and counter-comments on the paper. We also wrote to TRAI and the DoT on various subjects such as net neutrality in the context of the lockdown, traffic management practices, and OTT licensing. Our website blocking tracker has also helped us raise awareness about specific instances of website blocking (such as this and this) and advocate reform towards policy makers. To this extent, we engaged with the TRAI and DOT asking them to respect net neutrality while ensuring customer centric policies to expand access. We also successfully petitioned the Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s office for high speed internet in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. With regards to internet shutdown rules we continued to demand reforms to the provisions of the Telegraph Act to make it compliant with the Anuradha Bhasin judgement.\nDigital Infrastructure : As digitalisation increases in India, so does the need for more robust digital infrastructure. Moreover, given the prevailing socio-economic conditions, it must be ensured that digitalisation does not lead to exclusion from services. In this context, we analysed new frameworks for data architecture and data centres. We also discussed the use of digital technologies in the judicial system. As with all our work, the focus of these engagements derived from our constitutional values and hopes to centre large, digital systems towards individual liberty and social welfare.\nFacial Recognition Technology: As we had committed at the start of the year we focussed our efforts on long term study and policy position on the growth of Facial Recogniton Technology (FRT) that is increasingly being used in policing and state systems such as voting. We provided an overview of FRT systems in India, analysed such technologies from a legal standpoint, and examined international perspectives on the issues. Our efforts culminated with the launch of Project Panoptic, a FRT tracker we built for the Indian context.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s (not) all folks Though the Shreya Singhal Judgement deemed section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 to be unconstitutional, many ‘zombie’ cases continue to be registered under it. We analysed these ‘legal zombies’ and tracked uses of 66A. We also highlighted similar issues in the amendments to the Kerala Police Act, 2011 and provided certain recommendations to the Government Kerala on how to proceed after the repealing of the amendments.\nWe participated in the consultation process for the Health Data Management Policy (see here and here), and also advocated for state level frameworks for health data management. We also raised issues of worker surveillance (see here and here), and provided an explainer on the AgriStack. More recently, we conducted a review of the privacy policies of the four major telecom service providers.\nDo you have suggestions on what we can do better?

Here is a quick breakdown of all that we achieved this year. For 2021, we hope to further increase our collaboration to increase the impact of digital rights across the spectrum of individual liberty and social welfare.","title":"2020 in Review: Policy Advocacy in the year of Covid"},{"content":"  In January 2020, we set out with concise goals: Streamline and standardise internal processes and pick up the pace with our community engagement efforts. Through this rare writing appearance on the IFF blog, I will elucidate what these goals entailed and how much we were actually able to achieve:\nStreamlining Operational Processes: Throughout 2019, we realised that in order to succeed, we will have to improve and completely revamp our internal operations. This included the following:\n Streamline internal accounting processes, Stay up-to-date on regulatory compliances and get additional independent help with this, Automating our donor management processes, and Formalising our HR and Staff Wellness policies.  These objectives were set towards the start of the year, i.e. Pre Covid. The first two from the list faced huge delays because of the lockdowns. If coordinating before the pandemic wasn’t hard enough, Covid made it even tougher. Since IFF is an 80G and 12A registered non-profit organization, there is an avalanche of compliances and regulatory processes that we have to go through to get things done. We decided to reach out to people who were experts at these things and became a member of the Centre for Advancement of Philanthropy or CAP. This helped us gain confidence, knowing we were seeking regulatory advice from an independent body before establishing processes.\nStreamlining accounts:  Our older accounting processes were not ready to adapt to remote work and this was a huge point of stress for us when we started working from home. We had to adapt quickly with almost no notice. Thanks to the adjustments and quick measures taken by Apar and IFF’s board, we were able to make it through the lockdown and later cleaned up big parts of our processes. In November 2020, we were also able to finish the bank processes that had made very little headway during the lockdown. This has made our lives much easier and we’re looking forward to improving upon this through 2021.\nWe also got accreditation from Credibility Alliance and Guidestar to keep on increasing our financial transparency towards the public. You can see information about IFF’s financials on their websites. We hope to publish our first Annual Report in 2021 to provide you with more detailed information about this.\nAutomating Donor Processes and adopting HR and Staff Wellness Policies:  One other important goal we had to achieve was automating our donor management process. Our older system was reliant on manual processes. The problem was that this had the risk of errors and delays as we grew our donor base. These processes simply weren’t going to work if we wanted to scale up. And we really wanted to scale up! This was made possible by ERPNext’s Shivam and also our volunteer Anoop, who have worked with us relentlessly to get this process completed in time. This is a testament to our volunteers’ dedication towards IFF’s growth. At the time of writing, we had automated 90% of our processes and it’s nothing like the broken process we started out with. This was one of the highlights of the year for IFF’s operations staff.\nWe also managed to get a lot more batches of merchandise dispatched than we did in 2019. We sent IFF merchandise in 5 batches as opposed to 2019’s one sole dispatch. We are looking to improve upon this more since we are still not happy with this pace. We also adopted most of our HR Policies and updated our Leave Policy by introducing a Menstrual Leave Policy for the staff. All of these policies were drafted by staff who were involved throughout with inputs and improvements.\nCommunity Engagement: Internet Freedom Forum Another one of our goals was to expand our public engagement efforts and welcome new people to the IFF community. To do this, we launched the Internet Freedom Forum in February 2020. The forum now has close to 400 members and 500+ discussion topics. Our hope is to have 1000 forum sign-ons by the end of 2021. Spread the word!\nInternet Freedom Forum A place for India’s digital rights community Internet Freedom Forum      IFF Events The original pre-covid plan was to host one small IFF event at our Delhi office every month. We were lucky enough to be able to host Rohit De in our office in February, but that was the first and last in person event we hosted in 2020. After the lockdown, we moved towards hosting digital events and even set up our own instance of BigBlueButton (a privacy respecting open source video conferencing tool) with the help of Abhas, who volunteered to set it up for us. This year would have been impossible if not for the help of our community!\nTowards the beginning, we were really excited and hosted upto 3 events in a month! However, it was not sustainable and we decided to focus on quality over quantity. We shifted focus towards hosting practical webinars on topical issues. A public favourite turned out to be cheekily titled Why is Navika reading my texts? However, the highlight was our flagship event, Privacy Supreme. It saw the highest number of registrations in any IFF event and had an amazing lineup of speakers which included an interview between Faye D’Souza and Mahua Moitra. Close to 200 people tuned in for the event live and it was later viewed by close to 2000 people. We have created a playlist of all the digital events we have hosted, take a look:\nBoard Game Night and Monthly Newsletters This year we also focussed on giving timely and regular updates about our work. We started sending out a newsletter each month giving our members, donors and newsletter subscribers an update on our work. To make things a little fun and to entertain ourselves during the lockdown, we also hosted two board game nights for IFF members in partnership with ReRoll.\nThis has been a challenging year and we want to move towards 2021 with hope and kindness. Operations and Community are the backbone that enables our Policy and Strategic Litigation work to continue in a sustained manner. Our hope is to strengthen our operations and build community through 2021 to empower IFF to do the important work it has set out to do.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/year-in-review-scaling-up-iffs-operations-and-commuity/","summary":"In January 2020, we set out with concise goals: Streamline and standardise internal processes and pick up the pace with our community engagement efforts.","title":"2020 in Review: Scaling up IFF's Operations and Community"},{"content":"  24 December 2020: Yesterday, eight civil society organisations from across the world including Access Now, Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Internet Freedom Foundation, Paradigm Initiative, Privacy International, Reporters Without Borders, and Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales (R3D) filed an amici brief before the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals in California. The amici brief urges the Ninth Circuit to dismiss the NSO Group\u0026rsquo;s appeal claiming sovereign immunity from WhatsApp\u0026rsquo;s lawsuit which seeks to hold it liable for using WhatsApp’s servers to the deliver the Pegasus spyware to 1400 targets across the world.\nIn India, news first broke in October 2019 that at least two dozen human rights defenders including activists, academics, journalists and lawyers were targeted using a highly sophisticated spyware called Pegasus developed by the Israel based NSO Group. Pegasus targeted users by exploiting a vulnerability in WhatsApp, and it could gain complete access to a device by getting the user to click on a link or through a missed call. These revelations led to widespread outrage especially since the targets of the hack were human rights defenders and the NSO Group claims that it only sold Pegasus to government entities.\nThe fact that the NSO Group\u0026rsquo;s customers are government entities is key to its defence before courts in the United States, and it has argued that the doctrine of sovereign immunity which is typically only available to foreign nation states should also extend to private corporations which act at the behest of foreign nation states. If such an argument is accepted, it would be impossible to hold private corporations accountable for enabling human rights violations by authoritarian regimes.\nAs the amici brief notes, granting sovereign immunity to the NSO Group would __ place the surveillance industry wholly outside the framework created by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and leave victims without any remedy. The issue of remedilessness is particularly relevant in the Indian context because there has been no accountability for the Pegasus hack despite multiple parliamentary committees, central government departments and state governments claiming to investigate the issue.\nIn addition to legal arguments rooted in international human rights law, the amici brief also shines a spotlight on the harm suffered by human rights defenders who were targeted using Pegasus and it features personal accounts of victims from India, Rwanda, Togo and Morocco. In particular, the brief quotes activist, researcher and lawyer, Bela Bhatia who has been defending the rights of Adivasi communities in Chhattisgarh for several years and was one of the Indian targets of the Pegasus hack.\nOur executive director, Apar Gupta notes that:\n \u0026ldquo;On October 30 we marked one year of the NSO-Pegasus hack. Despite major headlines in India, there was an absence of any sustained institutional action for the terrible breaches of safety and privacy caused due to NSO Group\u0026rsquo;s Pegasus Spyware. We hope this amici brief helps achieve some redress at a systemic if not individual level for the victims, several of whom are journalists and human rights defenders, for this grossly illegal act of surveillance.\u0026rdquo;\n We are extremely grateful to Access Now for coordinating between the amici organizations and also to the litigators from Farella Braun + Martel LLP for their pro bono legal assistance in this case.\nImportant Documents:\n Amici brief filed by civil society organisations (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;One year of inaction, delay and evasion on the NSO-Pegasus hack\u0026rsquo; dated 02 November 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/ninth-circuit-amici-brief-whatsapp-nso-group-pegasus-hack/","summary":"8 civil society organisations from across the world including IFF have filed an amici brief before the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals in California urging the Court to dismiss the NSO Group\u0026rsquo;s appeal claiming sovereign immunity for the Pegasus hack.","title":"Statement: IFF joins international civil society orgs to oppose the NSO Group’s attempt to evade responsibility for the Pegasus Hack #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  tl;dr Replies to Right to Information requests filed to the Committee of Experts working on the Non-Personal Data Governance framework highlight an underlying transparency problem which has been mirrored throughout 2020 by various other such data-related consultations by the Government. As we await this draft report, \u0026ldquo;non-personal data\u0026rdquo; remains a badly defined concept that has crept into the Data Protection Bill being deliberated by the Joint Parliamentary Committee.\nRTIs responses on the Committee of Experts on NPD On August 20, 2020 we filed a Right to Information (RTI) request with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asking them to provide us with copies of documents relating to the functioning of the committee of experts, the minutes of meetings of the committee and any other document which was related to its functioning. On September 19, 2020 we received a reply from them stating that the Ministry maintains no record of the internal functioning of the committee of experts.\n  As a next step, we filed a first appeal against the reply dated October 30, 2020. In our appeal we stated that our third query pertaining to related documents does not relate to the internal working of the committee and on the contrary relates to third party correspondence, details of which can be made available easily. Additionally, submissions made to the committee can easily be provided since a record of them must exist electronically. However, in their decision the First Appellate Authority (FAA) stated that there are no further inputs to our queries than what have already been provided by the CPIO in the initial reply to our RTI request.\n  Both, the initial response and the decision of the FAA show a marked resistance to the goals of the RTI Act, 2005 which aims to “promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority”. These responses show that either the Ministry is failing to provide sufficient oversight to the committee or that there is a concerted effort to hamper transparency initiatives by civil society organizations.\nProblems with the NPD framework highlighted in our submissions On September 13, 2020 we made a submission to the Ministry of Electronics and IT highlighting certain key issues with the functioning and draft report of the Committee of NPD. These issues are:\n Ambiguity in definition and practice : The report states “non-personal data” as data which does not have personally identifiable attributes. This negative definitional framework is further divided into further classes however as noted by many commentators, this remains vague. IFF’s forum member, Tanya Varshney has written on this extensively in the context of a comparative analysis of the GDPR. She states clearly and rationally that, “The ambiguity kicks in when we are ascertaining what degree of identifiability is needed to categorize information as personal or non-personal data.” Ignoring the ease of re-identification : One of the central pillars of the draft report is that, “non-personal data” should not lead to re-identification. As our forum member, Shubham Jain states, “identifying what is personal data is very closely related to how difficult it is to re-identify someone from that dataset.” In the absence of a data protection law, specifically a Data Protection Authority, flirting with the idea of a non-personal data policy is laying a privacy minefield for everyday, ordinary Indians. Data maximisation and surveillance capitalism : The present expropriation of personal or non-personal data from silicon valley firms will not result in any clear user benefits but will lead to greater data collection and generation of sets. At a moment when India lacks a data protection law this becomes incredibly problematic for end-users. The economic assertions made within the report that non-personal data have the potential to unlock innovation and help local firms compete, is not even borne from any substantial evidence. Here, even models of competition law have been ignored. Hence, in sum, the present approach will lead to greater collection and a ratification of the problematic models of surveillance capitalism, in which even if we accept the premise of this report, data (which can easily be re-identified) will flow from foriegn entities to local ones.  Additionally, here it is also necessary to state that the currently prevailing regime on privacy in India rests largely on the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1). However, the draft report fails to even mention let alone follow the thresholds laid down in the decision.\n\u0026ldquo;Consultation Fatigue\u0026rdquo; ? The lack of transparency noticed in the working of the Committee of Experts on the NPD Framework can be seen to be a replication of various other consultations related to data that the government has conducted this year like the National Digital Health Mission Data Policy consultation and the Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack consultation. While we welcome and appreciate such public consultations, it is also important that these consultations drive positive changes in the policies being discussed and are not just used as a measure to fatigue civil society organisations which are already overburdened as a result of the pandemic.\nFor instance, many of these consultations often are preceded by private meetings where the agenda and priorities are identified. This is precisely the case with the draft report on non-personal data where private meetings were conducted prior to public comment. What was discussed there? Well, we don\u0026rsquo;t know yet, but will keep following through with the RTI to ensure greater transparency.\nImportant Documents  RTI request dated August 20, 2020 and reply received (link) First Appeal dated October 30, 2020 and FAA decision (link) Submission on Draft Non-Personal Data Report dated September 13, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/the-non-personal-data-policy-process-remains-opaque-and-problematic-saveourprivacy/","summary":"Replies to Right to Information requests filed to the Committee of Experts working on the Non-Personal Data Governance framework highlight an underlying transparency problem which has been mirrored throughout 2020 by various other such data-related consultations by the Government.","title":"The non-personal data policy process remains opaque and problematic #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Railtel\u0026rsquo;s broadband service Railwire seems to be arbitrarily blocking access to the internet forum Reddit and the search engine DuckDuckGo.

Over the last three months, multiple reports about Railtel have been lodged on our net neutrality violation tracker over at SaveTheInternet.in. These reports indicated that Railwire, Railtel\u0026rsquo;s retail broadband service, had been blocking access to Reddit and DuckDuckGo. Such incidents had also been reported in July with regards to other Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\nThese instances conform to observations of a larger study, published by the Centre for Internet and Society, in which researchers found that the website blocklists of licensed ISPs across India are widely inconsistent with one another. This suggests a larger pattern wherein internet providers are arbitrarily blocking access to particular sites/content without the backing of a legal order.\nThe legal basis for such blocks is unclear. The Unified License for ISPs states that licensees may block internet sites only when acting under a legal order. However, no reason has been provided to demonstrate why the sites above fulfil such criteria. Furthermore, as per the Anuradha Bhasin Judgement of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court that mandated that publicly displaying all orders restrict people\u0026rsquo;s access to the internet, no such orders for Reddit or DuckDuckGo are available.\nA continuing commitment   Do you notice any blocked websites without a clear legal basis?

Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches and provide them with more context for public awareness around them. In the month of December, we have up till now filed 24 RTI requests with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 19 requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology to increase transparency around these highly invasive systems. This month, we filed requests with:\n The Varanasi Development Authority, The Varanasi Nagar Nigam, The Central Board of Secondary Education, The Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology, The Punjab Police, The Hyderabad Police, The Surat Police, The Tamil Nadu Police, The Education Department, Delhi Government, The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), The Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) \u0026amp; The School Education Department of the Gujarat Government.  Additionally we also filed requests with:\n The UIDAI on the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 and the Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020. The Indian Council of Medical Research on the reported direction of Aadhaar being mandatory for COVID-19 testing. The Department of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare on the reported direction of Aadhaar being mandatory for COVID-19 testing. The UIDAI on the reported direction of Aadhaar being mandatory for COVID-19 testing. Dr. R. M. L. Hospital, New Delhi on the reported direction of Aadhaar card being mandatory for COVID-19 testing. The National Health Authority on their Health ID scheme. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation following reports that they used data collected by them to send targeted emails to individuals with a specific surname on the ongoing Farmer’s Protests.  Free Speech and Censorship Our other main focus is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the month of December, we have up till now filed 5 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Delhi Police on the reported suspension of Telecom Services around the Delhi and Haryana borders due to the ongoing Farmer’s Protests. The Home Department of the Haryana Government on the reported suspension of Telecom Services around the Delhi and Haryana borders due to the ongoing Farmer’s Protests. The Ministry of Home Affairs on the reported suspension of Telecom Services around the Delhi and Haryana borders due to the ongoing Farmer’s Protests. The Home Department of the Gujarat Government on whether they have complied with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India’s decision in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India (2020 SCC OnLine SC 25). The Ministry of Railways on reports that RailWire has blocked certain websites including www.duckduckgo.com and www.reddit.com.  One of our main requests in the instances of internet shutdowns and suspension of telecom services is to ask for a copy of the order through which such shutdowns or suspensions take place. Publication of internet shutdown orders and proper record-keeping is essential for two reasons. First, without access to internet shutdown orders, citizens cannot exercise their fundamental right to seek judicial review of arbitrary or disproportionate restrictions on internet access. Second, internet shutdowns cause huge economic losses and maintaining a consolidated record of all internet shutdowns imposed at the state and central level is necessary for evidence based policy reform.\nWithout official publication of orders, the only source of information about internet shutdowns in different parts of the country is media reports. However, the figures derived based on media reports do not represent the full scale of the problem and may fail to include shutdowns which are shorter in duration or localised in small towns and villages.\nSpecifically, in paragraph 96 of the decision in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India (2020 SCC OnLine SC 25), the Supreme Court held that all internet shutdown orders must be proactively published by the government.\n “It must be noted that although the Suspension Rules does not provide for publication or notification of the orders, a settled principle of law, and of natural justice, is that an order, particularly one that affects lives, liberty and property of people, must be made available …. We are therefore required to read in the requirement of ensuring that all the orders passed under the Suspension Rules are made freely available, through some suitable mechanism. ”\n Our work is ongoing This is the first in a new monthly series that we plan to publish to ensure that our transparency work can be used by others as well to demand accountability from public authorities as well as to create public awareness about how the RTI Act, 2005 can be used as a tool in the democratic process.\nImportant Documents  Internal govt documents provide insight into the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu dated December 3, 2020 (link) A look at Aarogya Setu through the Right to Information lens dated May, 27, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/iffs-right-to-information-report-for-december/","summary":"In this monthly series, we aim to provide information about how our RTI work is carried out and utilised to demand transparency and accountability from public authorities.","title":"Digital Transparency: A Right to Information Report for December, 2020"},{"content":"  Tl;dr We analysed the privacy of policies of the four large telecom service providers - Jio, Vi, Airtel, and BSNL - to check not only whether they were _Puttaswamy-_compliant, but also whether their policies would need updating in the face of the impending Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. We found certain issues in these policies, on the basis of which we have sent letters detailing our comments to these telecom service providers.\nWhy study privacy policies? On October 8th, 2020, Airtel updated its privacy policy. The updated policy stated that categories of information that Airtel would collect would include \u0026ldquo;political opinions, religious beliefs and sexual orientation\u0026rdquo;. A week later, reports emerged about the policy, with many users calling out the telecom service provider (TSP) on it\u0026rsquo;s policy for violating the privacy of users.\nWhile Airtel has subsequently amended its privacy policy, the incident brought to light the need to ensure that TSPs, who both generate and process large amounts of data on a daily basis, have robust privacy policies that does protects the digital rights of users and complies with legal and legislative frameworks for data security. Additionally, given that The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 was introduced in Parliament last year, we thought it might make sense to analyse these policies from the angle of the Bill as well. In our analysis, we tried to focus not just on issues related to privacy and digital security but also organisational practices. For this, we used the framework provided by the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, and then compared the four TSPs on how they fared with regards to metrics such as the existence of consent sharing mechanisms and data transparency.\nAirtel   Airtel may have updated its privacy policy, but significant issues still remain. For example, Airtel predicates the provision of services on the consent of the user to process data, explicitly stating that Airtel may discontinue services in which consent is not provided or is provided but then later taken back. Now, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB) itself unequivocally states that “the provision of any goods or services or the quality thereof, or the performance of any contract, or the enjoyment of any legal right or claim, shall not be made conditional on the consent to the processing of any personal data not necessary for that purpose”. Thus, if the PDPB were to be passed, such a privacy policy would be violative of the Act.\nThe PDPB also mandates certain additional safeguards for the processing of sensitive personal data, which are missing in the policy. Additionally, the policy states that Airtel may still have lawful grounds to process personal data once a user’s contract with Airtel has been terminated, even though the PDPB preserves the right to erasure. Data retention timelines and data anonymisation standards are missing from the policy as well.\nAirtel, like many other TSPs, requires us to send the famous \u0026lsquo;DND\u0026rsquo; SMS to stop receiving product or service-related information. However, Airtel has not clarified whether sending the requisite SMS shall simply stop the delivery of service information or acutally stop the processing of the relevant data as well. Additionally, the policy does not state whether consent shall be explicitly taken before sharing information with authorised third parties. Lastly, the policy may imply that security practices and prcedures taken by third parties may potentially be lower than the standards and procedures that Airtel would employ itself.\nJio   As might be expected, Jio\u0026rsquo;s privacy policy also has multiple issues. The policy notes that Reliance Jio, “may not be able to process your request of correction, updation or deletion, in case\u0026hellip; it is extremely difficult to implement”. The PDPB explicitly acknowledges the right to forgotten, and so it may not allow exemptions due to ‘technical difficulties’. The privacy policy also states that “withdrawal of consent may lead to cancellation of your registration with us or your access to our services”. Additionally, even though the Consumer Acquisition Form states that certain fields are optional, the policy does not make it clear whether a refusal or withdrawal of consent of optional fields would also result in the termination of services. Once again, the need for a new consent sharing paradigm for TSPs is demonstrated.\nJio\u0026rsquo;s privacy policy does not specify the standards of data anonymisation or data retention timelines. It also, again, seems to imply that it may hold its authorised third party partners to lower standards than itself. Furthermore, the policy lists ‘hacking’ as a case in which Reliance Jio exempts itself from responsibility in case of a breach of security. Now, the DoT’s user license agreementalso specifies that “The LICENSEE shall be completely and totally responsible forsecurity of their networks.” Given that this is, in fact, a situation which is not“outside [the] control” of Reliance Jio, it is regrettable that no additional security measures have been specified or planned to ensure that scenarios like the Big Basket data leak do not happen. Lastly, the ambiguity over whether the DND SMS stops the collection and sharing of data persists here as well.\nVi   The privacy policy of the newly established Vi too has certain issues. In the introduction, Vi seems to view the usage of services as equivalent to the provision of consent for the processing of data. However, clause 11(2) of the PDPB states certain principles that the provision of consent must fulfil, which may no be fulfilled by the policy as such consent may not be free or capable of being withdrawn. The policy also does not mention whether the withdrawal for processing certain data is viewed grounds for termination of services by Vi.\nIn an Airtel-esque gaffe, Vi\u0026rsquo;s privacy policy also seems to indicate that Vi may collect data about, “preferences for particular products, services or lifestyle activities”. This seems to be a textbook example of function creep, and the inclusion of such a clause is even more surprising given the recent furore faced by Airtel. The policy also states that one of the uses of personal data is “Inclusion in any telephone or similar directory or directory enquiry service provided or operated by us or by a third party”. If the collection of certain types of data is indeed mandatory for the use of services (as is implied, then this would then imply that inclusion in a directory follows the ‘opt-out’ model. An opt-out model has also been prescribed for the sharing of anonymised information with authorised third parties. Both of these would seem to contravene the directive laid down by the PDPB for the explicit provision of consent.\nIn what seems to be running themes, data retention timelines and data anonymisation standards are once again both missing from the policy, while Vi too does not specify any consent sharing any mechanism for sharing data with authorised third parties. Yet again, ambiguity of the implications of the DND SMS remain. Vi\u0026rsquo;s policy too seems to imply that it may allow the security standards of the third parties to be lax.\nBSNL   BSNL\u0026rsquo;s privacy policy is perhaps the most antiquated of the four, and thus is most in need of revision. A very basic error the privacy policy commits is that it fails to specify the types of data being collected. This would contravene clause 7(1) of the PDPB, which mandates providing information about the nature and categories of personal data to be collected to the data principal. Like the other TSP, BSNL fails to mention any consent sharing mechanisms for the processing of data, either with BSNL itself or with authorised third parties. Across various service providers, this is quite a large lacuna that must be addressed immediately.\nChapter V of the PDPB lays down certain rights of the data principal, such as theright to erasure, right to correction, and right to data portability. It is quiteegregious that the privacy policy fails to mention any of these, and is a situation that must resolved at the earliest. In line with what are probably \u0026lsquo;industry standards\u0026rsquo;, the privacy policy fails to mention either data anonymisation standards or data retention timelines. Unlike other TSPs, however, BSNL fails to mention even the basic security practices it is to follow itself.\nConclusion In a rapidly digitalised world, telecom service providers are a key nodal point for both the generating and processing of vast quantities of data. Additionally, most indians use the internet through mobile devices. Thus, it is extremely important to ensure that while using their services users do not find their digital rights and privacy compromised. However, as we have seen above, telecom service providers do not seem to provide safeguards in their privacy policies to secure the security and privacy of users. Such a situation is quite alarming, and illustrates not only the very pressing need for a data protection legislation (such as the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 or the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019) but also the necessity of strong regulation of TSPs with respect to data processing.\nImportant Documents  Table containing comparative analysis of the 4 Privacy Policies __ (link) The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) Privacy Policy of Airtel (link), Jio (link), Vi (link), and BSNL (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s comments on Airtel\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Policy (link), Jio\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Policy (link), Vi\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Policy (link), and BSNL\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Policy (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/privacy-policies-of-telecom-service-providers-or-why-you-shouldnt-just-click-accept/","summary":"We analysed the privacy of policies of the 4 large telecom service providers to check not only whether they were Puttaswamy-compliant, but also whether they would need updating in the face of the  Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

In the impleadment application, we have tried to provide a bigger picture of the state of OTT regulation in India and cautioned against judicial intervention at this stage because it is a complex and technical issue best addressed through legislative and policy making processes involving extensive stakeholder consultation.\nBackground On 05 August 2020, the Madras High Court issued notice in a PIL filed by a lawyer seeking regulation of content available on video streaming platforms (which host curated and commissioned content. Eg. Netflix) and video hosting platforms (which host user generated content. Eg. YouTube). The PIL alleges that these platforms are disseminating content which is abusive, obscene, adulterous and hurts religious sentiments. To address this problem, the PIL seeks establishment of a censor board to pre-screen online videos and it also seeks restrictions on the creation of YouTube accounts.\nThis PIL is one of several petitions filed before different High Courts across the country seeking regulation of OTT platforms. Fortunately, so far, the High Courts of Delhi, Bombay and Karnataka have declined to frame regulations for OTT platforms. However, in November 2020, the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting (MIB) informed the Punjab \u0026amp; Haryana High Court that over 23 OTT regulation cases were pending before different High Courts and a transfer petition would soon be filed before the Supreme Court. Therefore, with proliferation of such PILs, it is likely that cases relating to regulation of OTT platforms will be consolidated and transferred to the Supreme Court in the near future.\nRegulatory Attempts Regulation of OTT platforms has become a hot button issue in the past few years, and major industry players have tried to adopt a self-regulatory model which comes with its own set of problems. We had previously written to the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and cautioned against importing the model of television censorship into the online streaming space because a self-regulatory code which was privately devised by a handful of established players would __ harm innovation, disadvantage smaller new players and restrict viewer choice. In our follow up representation, we also warned about the creation of a Digital Content Complaint Council which could lead to overbroad and carterlized censorship.\nMore recently, in November 2020, the Cabinet Secretariat issued a notification stating that digital and online media including audiovisual programmes made available by online content providers falls within the jurisdiction of the MIB. This notification was issued under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 and we have previously explained why this notification by itself cannot justify licensing or content certification of OTT platforms unless supported by legislation enacted by Parliament. However, issuance of the notification has led to understandable nervousness about potential government regulation of OTT platforms which is reminiscent of the control exercised by MIB over films, television and radio.\nHighlights of the Impleadment Application IFF’s impleadment application was tagged with the PIL by the Madras High Court on 10 December 2020 and we expect the matter to be listed again after the winter break. We are extremely grateful to the legal team comprising Suhrith Parathasarathy and Surasika Parathasarathy for representing IFF before the Madras High Court in this case.\nIn the impleadment application, we have tried to provide a bigger picture of the state of OTT regulation in India and cautioned against judicial intervention at this stage for the following reasons.\nFirst, while considering the need for additional regulation, we must be wary of drawing a false equivalence between online video hosting/streaming platforms and television and film broadcasting. Heavy handed regulation which is applicable to traditional mediums may not be necessary for the internet because of its unique technical features and emphasis on private viewing experiences. Adopting a one size fits all approach and imposing pre-certification requirements on these online platforms would destroy their ability to create unconventional, thought-provoking and innovative content.\nSecond, the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) can be reasonably restricted in accordance with Article 19(2) only if there is a statute, rule or regulation. Therefore, Article 19(2) of the Constitution does not permit restrictions on online video hosting/streaming platforms in the absence of a legislation.\nThird, there are a large number of remedies already available under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 to tackle illegal content shared on the internet. Specifically, under Section 79 of the IT Act, online video hosting platforms which host user-generated content already have an obligation to take down unlawful content after receiving actual knowledge of the same through a court order or a notification from an appropriate government agency. Similarly, video streaming platforms which host curated and commissioned content can be held liable for existing offences under the IT Act which prohibit electronic publication of obscene or sexually explicit content.\nAny further regulation would be necessary only if there is a failure of market mechanisms. Moreover, this type of regulation should be formulated through the legislative process because extensive study and stakeholder consultation will be required due to the dynamic and technical nature of the online video hosting/streaming industry.\nImportant Links  Impleadment Application filed by IFF before Madras HC (link) Previous post titled ‘Statement: Today’s notification on online news media and OTT platforms will require greater vigilance’ dated 11 November 2020 (link) Previous post titled ‘Read our follow up letter to Justice A.P.

IFF has submitted its comments on the draft document highlighting the following issues: a need for concrete overarching principles, the extent of the role of the oversight body, robust regulation for the private sector, and risk assessment based restrictions for certain uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nIssues As pointed out in Part 1 of the working document, the use of AI presents manifold risks:\n AI systems could pick spurious correlations in the underlying data, leading to good accuracy in test datasets but significant errors in deployment. \u0026lsquo;Deep Learning\u0026rsquo; systems remain opaque \u0026lsquo;black boxes\u0026rsquo;, showing a high degree of accuracy even though explanations for the same elude technicians, leading to a lack of trust, accountability, and, ultimately, usage. Large scale deployment of AI leads to a large number of high frequency decisions, amplifying the impact of unfair bias. This may cause a lack of trust and disruption for social order. Technological erros may lead to large scale exclusion of citizens from services guaranteed by the state. A lack of consequences reduces incentive for responsible action, while difficulties in the allocation of liability arise in grievance redressal. AI systems may use personal data without the explicit consent of concerned persons. Advanced technology may also discern potentially sensitive information from the outputs of the system. AI systems are susceptible to attack such as manipulation of data being used to train the AI, manipulation of system to respond incorrectly to specific inputs, etc The rapid rise of AI has led to automation of a number of routine jobs, which, without adequate re-skilling and support from the state, may cause social unrest. Psychological profiling enabled by AI and the ease of spreading propaganda through online platforms has potential to cause social disharmony and disrupt democratic process.  Part 1 of the document lays down 7 core principles to mitigate these harms as well as to ensure that a common benchmark for the beneficial use of AI across different sectors is developed. These principles are:\n Principle of Safety and Reliability Principle of Equality Principle of Inclusivity and Non-discrimination Principle of Privacy and security Principle of Transparency Principle of Accountability Principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values  What does the draft document say? The draft document clarifies the nature and roles of the oversight body for AI technology. It proposes that the oversight body be a highly participatory advisory body, and take on the following roles:\n Manage and update AI principles laid down Research into the various issues related to AI Provide clarity on design structures, standards, guidelines, etc Promote development and access to AI data and technology tools Help create awareness about responsible AI among various stakeholders Coordinate between different sectoral regulators Represent India in international dialogues on AI  The draft document aso specifies the need for an AI Ethics Committee in public sector bodies to handle the procurement, development, operations phase of AI systems and to ensure adherence to the Responsible AI principles. Self regulation is recommended for the private sector, with accountability for ethics being assigned to existing leadership.\nEnsuring that AI truly works for All Our recommendations are based on 4 key issues:\n Need for concrete overarching principles: Part 1 of the working document lists certain principles as principles for responsible AI. However, obscurity still persists with regards to the implication of adoption of these principles in the regulatory framework. Thus, we believe that there is a need to spell out both the detailed meaning of the principles which will work as a foundation to build enforcement mechanisms on as well as the implications of adopting them for regulatory frameworks. Greater role for oversight body: The draft document proposes the Council for Ethics and Technology as an oversight mechanism, which will be a “highly participatory advisory body”. We appreciate the formation of such an oversight body, due to the absence of clear laws and legal requirements governing AI, the Council for Ethics and Technology should have more than mere advisory functions and perform a regulatory assurance role, in conjunction with any forthcoming data authority, under the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. This should be specifically with the nature of any AI based system that impacts any legal right of a person. Robust regulation for the private sector: The draft document proposes voluntary self-regulation as a starting point for regulating AI in the private sector in India. While self-regulatory efforts are commendable, they should not be made a substitute for laws needed to closely monitor AI. In order to foster a healthy AI ecosystem, soft laws of self-regulation need to be complemented with strict provisions to govern high risk applications of AI. Risk assessment based restrictions for different sectors: All AI is not the same since the term envelopes within its multiple technologies. Thus, on the basis of a sector specific risk-assessment study, proportionate restrictions on the use of AI should be in place until an overarching, regulatory framework has been developed.  Risk Based Assessment - AI in Facial Recognition Technology Procedure In our submission, we provided a template risk based assessment for illustrative purposes, which was based on the following procedure:\n Step 1: The Council must categorize use cases of AI into the 4 types of Algorithmic Systems based on the AI Now Institute’s categorization of algorithmic systems used in their 2018 ‘Algorithmic Accountability Policy Toolkit’. Step 2: The Council must assess the type of data collected by the AI into anonymous data, personal and sensitive personal data,, Step 3: Based on type of data, risk assessment may be done with sensitive personal data having the highest risk assessment and anonymous data the lowest (Scale of 1-3 with 3 being the highest). Step 4: Based on the level of risk assessment combined with the type of algorithmic system, the regulation framework may be designed by the Council.  The dangers of AI in Facial Recognition Technology Here, we would like to address the use of AI for facial recognition technology (FRT). FRT which collects sensitive personal data for criminal justice purposes should be banned from being developed and deployed in India. Under IFF’s Project Panoptic, we have been mapping FRT systems across the country which are being developed and deployed without any regulatory framework as well as without any public awareness or transparency pertaining to how they will be used.\nBy our estimation, there are currently 19 different FRT projects which are being used by Police and Security/Intelligence agencies at the Central and State level in different stages of development and deployment. This is being done in the absence of a personal data protection law/regime as well as any specific regulation for FRT. The harms of such use are manifold:\n One sort of harm results from the implementation of a faulty FRT system wherein the technology is inaccurate in identifying and matching faces from a photo/video to an existing database. Such inaccuracy could lead to a false positive result from the FRT. This may lead to discrimination and strengthening of existing biases. In the present context, a false positive by a FRT system being used by the police could lead to wrongful arrest and detention of an innocent person. Another type of harm results from the implementation of an accurate FRT system wherein the technology achieves 100% accuracy in identifying and matching faces from a photo/video to an existing database. While there have been claims of a fully accurate FRT system, none of these claims have been corroborated by independent review and audit. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has extensively tested FRT systems for ‘1:1’ verification and ‘1:many’ identification and how accuracy of these systems vary across demographic groups. These independent studies have concluded that, currently, no FRT system has 100% accuracy. Probe images for FRT systems are often collected by the police through CCTV cameras installed in public spaces. Individuals in a CCTV surveilled area may be aware that they are under surveillance but the assumption is that this surveillance is temporary. Use of CCTV in conjunction with FRT would mean their images will be stored for a longer period of time, if not permanently. This data will also be used to extract particular data points such as the facial features and other biometrics (sensitive personal data) which the individual has not consented to sharing when entering a CCTV surveilled zone and these data points can be used to track future movements of the person. Therefore, integration of FRT with a network of CCTV cameras would make real time mass surveillance extremely easy.  Goes against standards set by the Supreme Court We would like to emphasise that use of FRT for criminal justice purposes goes beyond the standards laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1). The landmark decision lays down certain thresholds which the State must conform to to justify intrusions by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. These thresholds are:\n Legality: Where the intrusion must take place in the presence of a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. As we know, there is no anchoring legislation in place to regulate the use of FRT by the police. Additionally, we do not have a data protection regime to oversee the collection, processing and storage of data collected by these systems. Necessity: Which justifies that the restriction to people’s privacy (in this case data collection and sharing) is needed in a democratic society to fulfill a legitimate state aim. Use of FRT by the police has been justified based on reasons pertaining to security of the public and the country itself, with proponents saying it will enable automatic identification and verification through criminal databases. This characterisation is based on the faulty assumption that facial recognition technology is accurate, when ongoing research in the field has shown that completely accurate facial recognition technology has not been developed yet. Use of such inaccurate technology, especially for criminal prosecution, could thus result in a false positive. Proportionality: Where the Government must show among other things that the measure being undertaken has a rational nexus with the objective. FRT contemplates the collecting of sensitive personal information, intimate information of all individuals in the absence of any reasonable suspicion by collecting images and videos from a scene of crime. This could cast a presumption of criminality on a broad set of people. Collecting sensitive personal information of all individuals who were present at the scene of crime creates a presumption of criminality which is disproportionate to the objective it aims to achieve. Procedural safeguards: Where there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. In the absence of any checks and balances, function creep becomes an immediate problem wherein the issue of FRT being used for functions more than its stated purpose becomes a reality. Use of FRT without safeguards could result in illegal state-sponsored mass surveillance which would have a chilling effect on fundamental rights such right to freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of association which are guaranteed in the Constitution.  Recommended Restriction Use of this technology has raised concerns not only in India but also abroad with various civil society organisations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Algorithmic Justice League and Amnesty International calling for ban on the use of this technology. Calls for a total ban have been gaining momentum due to the fear that use of facial recognition by the police and security/intelligence agencies will not only lead to violation of the rights to privacy and freedom of speech and expression but also lead to human rights violations by helping to increase systemic bias against already marginalised communities. The impact on marginalised communities gains special importance for us locally due to the wide inequality and diversity present in our society. Thus, we recommend that the use of FRT be banned.\nImportant Documents  NITI Aayog\u0026rsquo;s draft Working Document: Enforcement Mechanisms for Responsible #AIforAll (link) NITI Aayog\u0026rsquo;s Working Document: Towards Responsible #AIforAll (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s comments on the draft document (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Project Panoptic FRT Tracker (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/ensuring-true-ai-for-all/","summary":"IFF has submitted its comments on NITI Aayog\u0026rsquo;s draft Working Document: Enforcement Mechanisms for Responsible #AIforAll, highlighting the following issues: need for concrete  principles, role of the oversight body, robust regulation for the private sector, and risk assessment based restrictions .","title":"Going beyond hashtags: how to ensure AI technology truly benefits everyone"},{"content":"  Tl;dr The Draft Code on Social Security (Central) Rules 2020, following the Code on Social Security, 2020, makes Aadhaar based registration mandatory for receving benefits. This may contradict a Supreme Court judgement that allowed mandating Aadhaar linkage only in the case of a service or benefit provided at the cost of the Consolidated Fund of India. A Standing Committee report on the Code on Social Security had already asked the Ministry of Labour to harmonise the provisions of the Code with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s judgement. Additionally, existing criticisms of Aadhaar based authentication for welfare delivery systems remain unaddressed. Lastly, databases containing the data of workers must have adequate security safeguards.\nWhat do the Draft Rules say? Article 142 of the Code on Social Security, 2020 states that employees or unorganised workers must, to register as beneficiaries for social security benefits or avail other social security services, \u0026ldquo;establish his identity or, as the case may be, the identity of his family members or dependants through Aadhaar number\u0026rdquo;. In line with this, the Draft Code on Social Security (Central) Rules, 2020 specify Aadhaar linkage for the receipt of payments or other benefits under the Code. The table below details the instances where a worker may be asked to provide their Aadhar.\n   Rule Content     19 Every state employee has to mandatorily register with their Aadhaar on the Specified Portal.   47 Every building/ other construction worker is required to register on the specified portal   50(1)(a) Every eligible unorganised worker is mandated to register either with Aadhaar, on self-declaration basis in the form on the portal, as specified by the Central Government   50(2) Every eligible gig worker or platform worker is required to register with Aadhaar, on self-declaration basis in the form on the portal, as specified by the Central Government   60(1)(h) Every establishment must seed the Aadhaar Number of each of the members in the respective members’ account    What does the Puttaswamy Judgement specify? In Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors, the Supreme Court, while upholding the constitutionality of Aadhaar, affirmed the Right to Privacy and noted that Aadhaar can constitutionally be linked only for benefits funded by the Consolidated Fund of India.\nGiven that social security benefits such as insurance, provident fund contributions and gratuity accrue at the cost of the employer, mandating Aadhaar for the receipt of the same may contravene the judgement. The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation has even passed an order removing penalties for employees who had not completed Aadhar based registration.\nFurther, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour has also flagged this in its report on the Code on Social Security, 2019 where it notes the budgetary outlay from the consolidated fund of india is not clearly earmarked. The Committee asked the Ministry to reconsider mandatory Aadhaar linkage in light of the Supreme Court judgement, pointing out that Aadhaar may be mandated only for benefits provided from the Consolidated Fund of India.\nExisting state of Aadhaar based verification Aadhaar based verification may present an additional hurdle to accessing benefits for social security, as this system has already been criticised in other contexts. Technology failures plague the authentication system, and have already led to serious issues of exclusion from welfare benefits. The CEO of UIDAI had noted that in 2018 authentication failure for government services was as high as 12%. Furthermore, as of March 3rd, 2020, only 60% of the total allocated grains per month have been distributed on the basis of biometric verification of Aadhaar.\nThe efficacy of Aadhaar based registration for schemes has been studied in various contexts. One study in Jharkhand found that Aadhaar based authentication “either did not reduce errors of inclusion or leakage or did so at the cost of increased exclusion error”. Another study for Aadhaar based verification in PDS shops found that the system is “rife with technical issues such as incomplete seeding of cardholder information, biometric failure and administrative gaps such as inadequate failure reporting and back-up systems”.\nLastly, a study sampling Aadhaar based authentication in diverse settings such as PDS distribution, NREGA work, LPG subsidies, midday meals, and the National Social Assistance Programme found that \u0026ldquo;Available evidence does not substantiate any signifi cant gains from Aadhaar-integration in welfare programmes. On the contrary, it has inflicted considerable pain. Apart from (supposedly) one-time costs of enrolment and Aadhaar-seeding, people are now faced with higher transaction costs on a monthly basis (in pensions and the PDS for instance), and in a significant minority of cases, also face exclusion and denial. Even when it works, people suffer from considerable indignities\u0026rdquo;.\nThus, considering the Supreme Court judgement as well as the negative externalities of using Aadhaar based verification, we recommend that Aadhaar linkage not be mandated for the receipt of social security benefits. Instead, a social security card may be provided to workers to help with registration and service delivery. Furthermore, verification through Aadhaar should be made truly consensual, and verification should be allowed through multiple government IDs such\nDatabasing of Workers Databases such as the Shram Suvidha portal help employers with labour law compliance. The Draft Rules mention the use of the Shram Suvidha portal (or any other portal that may be specified) for registering workers as beneficiaries. While such a database does indeed both help facilitate compliance and allow the government to monitor labour law implementation, provisions must be made to ensure that the data of workers is secured, especially since registration may involve the provision of personal data. Such data may also be used by employers for workers surveillance. Given that a comprehensive legislation regarding data protection, such as the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2020 or the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code 2020, is yet to be passed, we recommend that a provision be included that specifies that that adequate measures must be taken, as provided by the relevant authority, by both public and private compliance portals and employee databases to ensure the security of data.\nImportant Documents  Code on Social Security, 2020 (link) Draft Code on Social Security (Central) Rules, 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s comments on the Draft Rules (link) Standing Committee on Labour, Ninth Report: The Code on Social Security (link) The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 as introduced as a private members bill by Mr. D.

The Agristack is a collection of technology based interventions in the farming and agriculture sector that hold the potential to result in dramatic changes. Through the explainer we hope to provide an introduction to the \u0026lsquo;Agristack\u0026rsquo; and its potential benefits and drawbacks, with a larger aim of starting a public conversation about this issue.\nWhat is the AgriStack? The AgriStack is a collection of technologies and digital databases proposed by the Central Government focusing on India’s farmers and the agricultural sector. The central government has claimed that these new databases are being built to primarily tackle issues such as poor access to credit and wastage in the agricultural supply chain.\nUnder the government’s latest proposed solution, each farmer will be provided with a digital ID, which will be linked to their Aadhaar number. Data to be collected by the AgriStack may include personal details, profile of land held, production details, and financial details.\n  What are its policy and legislative origins?    Document Recommendations     Report of the Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income Volume XI The report discusses the role of digital technologies and digitalisation in agriculture. Chapters 7 \u0026amp; 8 examine the potential use of Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain technology in agriculture.   NITI Aayog’s Discussion Paper on National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence The paper from page 30 discusses various strategies for commeditised agriculture using big data and specific use cases around Artificial Intelligence   Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 Section 4(2): The Centre may prescribe a system for electronic registration for a trader, modalities of trade, and the mode of payment for farm produce. Section 5: Allows the establishment of an electronic trading and transaction platform for farm produce by private persons, for which the Centre may specify norms and rules. Section 7: The Centre may set up a Price Information and Market Intelligence System for farmer’s produce. Section 17(2a): The Centre Government may specify rules with respect to the system of electronic registration for traders and farmers.    What are the proposed benefits of a proposed, “AgriStack”? The NITI Aayog states that diverse problems such as inadequate access to credit and information, pest infestation, crop wastage, poor price discovery, and yield forecasting can be sufficiently addressed by use of digital technology. This is done through market and state based mechanisms that rely on improving four central areas: financing, production inputs, farming methods_,_ and supply and distribution.\nWhat may be potential issues with an Agristack? Firstly, no farmer organisations seem to have been consulted during the drafting of the recent agricultural reforms. Further evidence of the undemocratic, non-transparent policy making process can be witnessed by the current farmer protests going on across the country, where several farmers unions have criticised the government precisely for introducing laws without any consultations in the midst of restrictions of a raging pandemic\nSecondly, it is alarming that without adequate consultations, MEITY has stated that the blueprint for AgriStack is already in the advanced stage. Databasing which then is utilised towards algorithm based decision making will impact farmers' rights without transparency or accountability. With the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2020 yet to be passed, implementing the AgriStack without adequately addressing such issues may lead to harms.\nThe proposed framework for Agristack faces serious questions related to privacy. Farms generate a huge amount of data in their daily operations, and so are fertile ground for agritech and fintech firms. Thus, in their quest to provide farmers with better services, they may end up harvesting and processing farm data without the consent of the farmer, leading to a situation where, “banks and insurance companies [know] more about the incomes and businesses of farms than the individual farmers themselves”. Farmers may also be unable to adequately judge the value of their data and so may end up with compensation that is incommensurate with the same.\nHow may the loss of privacy impact farmers?  Financial lending models relying on technology towards farmers may offer usurious rates for those in dire need. Given the incomplete nature of land title records, farmers may also be exploited by land grabs by large agribusinesses. Besides, the framework seems to extract sensitive fiscal data without solving credit issues: the Report of the Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income itself states that land-holdings only become profitable above 2 hectares (and barely even then). Given that 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal, it is understandable that farmers are having to resort to debt-funded consumption. There exist risks of exclusion which has been well documented by studies on Aadhaar linked welfare delivery systems have already faced criticism for exclusion, with several studies showing that the verification system is rife with technical errors such as biometric failures that have led to significant exclusion. Algorithm based decision making may further reduce the agency of farmers if and when AI based decision making becomes widespread, possibly impacting on legal rights.  Recommendations  Comprehensive consultations on the merits of the proposal with farmer groups and unions on their very premise before any policy document is implemented. The utilisation of technology must happen on the basis of feedback that emerges from these conversations. Academics, technologists, civil society and digital rights organisations to be engaged with on the development of the “AgriStack” both as a policy framework and its execution proceeding from the concerns and experiences of farmers. This will require long term study and constant engagement twith farmers and farmers' organisations to understand the real issues of the farmers. Examination of the relationship between personal data and digital policies such as the Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) to be conducted in the context of the ongoing process of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Data Protection Bill. Hitherto identified issues within the existing draft of the Draft Data Protection Bill must be addressed and also contrasted against the rights centric proposed by the The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 as introduced as a private members bill by Mr. D. Ravikumar, Member of Parliament.  As mentioned earlier, this blog and the explainer mark our initial attempt to understand the issues surrounding the AgriStack and start a conversation on the same.\nIf you have any comments on the Agristack or on our work on the issue, please do let us know here, especially if you are yourself a farmer or belong to a farmers' organisation.

These documents were obtained by IFF through the Right to Information Act, 2005 and they contain information about several projects including the Aarogya Setu proximity exposure notification app, the ITIHAS hotspot mapping and prediction system, collection of cell tower location data by the Department of Telecom, and apps to input data regarding RT-PCR and antigen tests.\nBackground In April 2020, we filed RTI applications seeking information about the Aarogya Setu app with various government authorities including the Ministry of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare (MoHFW). Since we did not receive a response to our RTI queries within the stipulated 30 day time period, we filed a first appeal with MoHFW which was transferred to the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) like the original RTI application. Finally, on 10 November 2020, DeitY shared minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group Committee on Technology and Data Management held between 31 March 2020 to 10 August 2020 in response to our RTI queries.\nThe Central Government has constituted several Empowered Groups under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA 2005) and powers have been delegated to these groups through orders which reference Sections 10(2)(h) and (i) of the Act. However, Section 10 does not permit any delegation of power and none of the provisions of DMA 2005 contain any reference to an “Empowered Group”. Therefore, the legality of this delegation of power upon Empowered Groups is questionable. The Government has constituted 11 Empowered Groups in total and the 9th Group has been specifically tasked with \u0026lsquo;Technology and Data Management\u0026rsquo; and it is responsible for the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu.\nThe minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group obtained through the RTI Act provide an insider view of the government\u0026rsquo;s data collection projects during the COVID-19 pandemic which include the Aarogya Setu proximity exposure notification app, the ITIHAS hotspot mapping and prediction system, collection of cell tower location data by the Department of Telecom, and apps to input data regarding RT-PCR and antigen tests.\nAarogya Setu Mobile App The documents clearly state that there should be two-way sharing of data between Aarogya Setu and other databases which include the COVID India Portal (S-3) and the Ayushman Bharat System. These databases would also be connected to apps for RT-PCR and antigen tests to create a single source of truth. __ Here are some of the relevant portions of the minutes which descibe the relationship between different databases.\n(i) Aarogya Setu and COVID India Portal (S-3)\n \u0026ldquo;It was decided that that there should be integration of Bluetooth contact tracing data of Confirmed Positive cases from Aarogya Setu to S3 System. The contact tracing data should be visible to the district / state officers through S3 System interface enabling them to track and take necessary action for testing/ surveillance of these suspect cases. The action taken by the officers on this cases then should flow back to Aarogya setu to complete the cycle.\u0026quot;\n (ii) Aarogya Setu and Ayushman Bharat\n \u0026ldquo;Leads in the Aarogya Setu should be verified by Ayushman Bharat System and the filtered set of leads should be shared with states. Further feedback and action taken from field staff should flow back to Aarogya Setu.\u0026quot;__\u0026ldquo;The group was further informed that both Bluetooth and self assessment data (cleaned by Aarogya Bharat) are flowing from Aarogya Setu to S3 and vice-versa.\u0026quot;\n During the meetings, concerns were raised about sharing of health data between so many databases with Dr. Harpreet Singh, ICMR noting that \u0026ldquo;lab data of Covid-19 is highly sensitive (health data) and at present there are many APIs for sharing of data with different stakeholders including NDMA, NHA \u0026amp; others. There is need for Do’s and Don’ts with clear set of guidelines to secure the data.\u0026quot; Government officials also seem to be aware of inaccurate reporting of a person\u0026rsquo;s status by the Aarogya Setu app. For instance, during one of the meetings, Mr. RS Mani, DDG NIC highlighted \u0026ldquo;the issue of false alarm (person released from hospital but status not updated).\u0026quot;\nThe technical design choices of Aarogya Setu have been a subject of discussion among members of the 9th Empowered Group and officials from National Informatics Centre (NIC) were required to explain their reasons for adopting a static ID and not sharing the source code initially but these reasons are not mentioned in the minutes. NIC officials further pointed out that India could not use the Google-Apple API because it prohibited location tracking. NIC was also entrusted with the responsibility of handling the back end code of Aarogya Setu and it worked with pro bono volunteers from HP on this project.\nITIHAS Hotspot Mapping and Prediction System The minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group contain several references to the ITIHAS system developed by Prof. Kamakoti, IIT Madras and NSAB for hotspot mapping and prediction. The forecasts from ITIHAS were to be integrated with the COVID India Portal (S3) and Prof. Kamakoti also made a presentation on findings from integration of ITIHAS with Aarogya Setu data. The documents also contain references to a project called \u0026lsquo;Aarogya Rekha\u0026rsquo; being developed by Prof. Kamakoti which would be integrated with Aarogya Setu. Once this integration was done, states would then be asked to start using this tool for geographical marking of hot-spots.\nUse of Cell Tower Location Data The minutes of meetings reveal that proposals to use cell tower location data to track the movement of persons was first considered in the context of the post lockdown exodus of migrants. It was decided that the Department of Telecom (DoT) would determine what kind of telecom data could be obtained about movement of migrants and this data could subsequently be shared with state governments to follow up with individual cases.\nOnce this data was collected by DoT, it was shared with Professor Kamakoti for further analysis and it was also made available on the COVID India Portal (S-3). In later meetings, it is clarified that the data has been aggregated at Cell Tower Level and anonymised to remove all mobile numbers and personal details but it is not clear at what stage such anonymisation took place.\nDuring one of the meetings, the DoT officials also offered to \u0026ldquo;monitor the intrusion (persons with/without pass) and report the telephone numbers which do not have valid pass to States/Authorities.\u0026quot; For this purpose, DoT was supposed to create a dashboard with latitude and longitude coordinates for all telephone numbers which could be piloted in a city.\nImportant Documents  Folder containing minutes of meetings of 9th Empowered Group (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;A look at Aarogya Setu through the Right to Information lens\u0026rsquo; dated 27 May 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/aarogya-setu-minutes-of-meetings/","summary":"Minutes of meetings of the 9th Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management provide an insider view into the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu and other government data collection projects during the COVID-19 pandemic.","title":"Internal govt documents provide insight into the creation and expansion of Aarogya Setu #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  tl;dr The withdrawal of the much criticised Section 118A of the Kerala Police Act, 2011, does not mean such proposals may not arise in future. Today we made clear proposals to the Government of Kerala to help avoid any overbroad or unnecessary criminalisation of online speech while also making sure abuse, threats or any of the harms that emerge on social media can be checked.\nBackground on S.118A of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 The Government of Kerala announced on October 21, 2020 its decision to amend the Kerala Police Act, 2011 through an Ordinance. The amendment inserted Section 118A that was ostensibly aimed to prevent cyber attacks against women and children. We noted with concern that the text of this provision had not been made available on the official websites of the Government of Kerala and neither had it been put towards any public consultation. This deviated from the norm of transparency and pre-legislative consultation.\nIt was also a matter of concern that this amendment was introduced through Ordinance which raised serious concerns about its validity. It was our opinion that any such amendment which curbs free speech on the internet needed to undergo sufficient legal scrutiny which can be achieved only if it is discussed and debated upon by the state legislature. Thus, we wrote to the Government of Kerala on October 24, 2020 highlighting these concerns. Subsequently, the Government of Kerala announced its decision to repeal Section 118A.\nWhat should do the Government do next? The withdrawal of the much criticised Section 118A of the Kerala Police Act, 2011, does not mean such proposals may not arise in future. Today, we have written to the Chief Minister of Kerala, Shri Pinarayi Vijayan with suggestions on the process that may be followed in future to move from controversy towards solutions to meet the objectives of checking online abuse, threats and misinformation.\nFirst, Adoption of a public, deliberative process : In order to ensure that all relevant stakeholders provide suggestions, the Govt. of Kerala should draft and release a consultation paper. Such a paper may be put to transparent, public consultation following a model of participatory democracy thereby deepening the trust of people in any recommendations which are made subsequently. It should specifically, explain the need for which the provision is being enacted; look beyond the law and criminalisation and address civic issues such as digital literacy, online norm building behaviour and platform accountability; consult with local groups who may provide deeper insights into the issue.\nSecond, Positive acknowledgment of the role of digital media : There is a tendency in such conversations to often focus on the harms that may be not be balanced with the benefits of digital communications. Here, it is also important to highlight the various beneficial aspects of digital media as well to ensure that over-regulation does not lead to over-broad censorship. This can be clustered into two broad categories. First, access to the internet links to fundamental rights as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its landmark decisions in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2013) 12 SCC 73 and Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India 2020 SCC OnLine SC 25. Second, make reference to international digital rights standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and specific guidance by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression.\nThird, seek clear legal opinion : If the outcome of any of the recommendations through this public consultation process is towards any legal provisions we urge that this legal opinion should be sought from the Kerala Advocate General. This legal opinion and the provision should be made public. This will help public scrutiny and feedback, deepen trust. It will also help scrutiny with established Supreme Court precedents through the participation of a growing number of legal experts, academics and practitioners who actively engage in such debates.\nFinally, put any proposal to legislative scrutiny.\nFinally, it must be ensured that any provision which is developed through such a transparent process is also laid in front of the State legislature for scrutiny. We must consciously move from the use of ordinance making powers. The introduction of the S.118A through ordinance was one of its many failings as it did not follow the due process of parliamentary debate and scrutiny.\nThis is a collective victory for local civil society groups The decision of the Government of Kerala to repeal S.118A of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 is an emphatic win for civil society groups who vehemently opposed the provision by highlighting the free speech risks it posed. Local groups such as the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) and local press were instrumental in ensuring that the Government was aware of the will of the people and their sustained opposition to the provision.

DEPOL/R/E/20/07128, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police cum Public Information Officer: Crime has stated that they cannot share the requisite information about the facial recognition technology system being used by the Delhi Police u/s 8(d) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.\n  Since there is no S. 8(d) of the RTI Act, we assume that the PIO was referring to S. 8(1)(d) of the Act which states that:\n Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen, information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information;\n This could mean that the system may be exploited in the future for some commercial use. It also means that certain commercial/proprietary rights may be vested with the third parties themselves. This calls into question the motivation of the company supplying the technology, in this case Innefu Labs Pvt. Ltd., who have access to the data collected by the Delhi Police. Since we do not have any information about any privacy protections put in place by the Delhi Police to protect the data of the citizens of Delhi, the concern that the data collected may be accessed by Innefu without the consent of the citizens to whom the data belongs and be processed further for commercial purposes arises.\nKolkata Police In a reply dated November 18, 2020 to a Right to Information request (link; see page 25) dated July 30, 2020, the Office of the Commissioner, Kolkata Police has stated that that the information pertaining to their facial recognition technology system that we asked for relates to their Detective department and that the department was exempted from disclosure under the RTI Act u/s 24(4).\n  Section 24(4) of the RTI Act states that “certain organisations” such as intelligence and security organisations do not come under the purview of the act and can be exempted from disclosure if the government specifically exempts them by notification in the Official Gazette. This means that the Kolkata Police is using facial recognition technology without there being any avenue through which transparency and accountability can be demanded from them for their use of such an invasive technology.\nTelangana State Technology Services (TSTS) In a reply dated November 11, 2020 to a Right to Information request dated October 23, 2020 the Telangana State Technology Services has stated that the results of using facial recognition technology system for authentication of voters by the Telangana State Election Commission with an accuracy rate of 80% were satisfactory.

In our comments, we highlighted four issues we felt the draft policy must address: firstly, that safeguards must be put in place to ensure that truly informed consent is taken; secondly, for sustainable innovation the policy must oriented the use of technologies towards the interests of citizens and move away from making __ financial sector models it\u0026rsquo;s central framework; thirdly, that a firm and robust regulatory mechanism through a proposed Data Protection Authority for consent managers must be enforced; and lastly, that the role of civil society must be expanded from a watchdog to a important stakeholder with a seat on the table.\nWhat is the DEPA? The aim of the proposed Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) is to centre consent sharing mechanisms around the rights of users. It categorises individuals/organisations into four distinct types:\n Data Users: Bodies that look to process data to provide a serviceThese include fintech companies, credit providers, and banks. Users: Individuals whose consent for processing data is being asked for. Data Fiduciaries: Institutions that generate and control the data of users. Consent Managers: Bodies that will mediate consent sharing between data users, users, and data fiduciaries.  The DEPA mechanism operates in the following way: a data user sends a request for processing the data of a user to a consent manager. The consent manager then asks the user for their consent. Should such consent be forthcoming, the consent manager then generates a consent artefact that contains details such as the precise type of data that will be processed, who is allowed to process it, and the reason for which the data is being processed. This consent artefact is then sent to the data fiduciary, who then, in a pipeline independent of the consent manager, sends the data to the data user.\nSuch a model has already begun to be implemented in the financial sector. The RBI has announced a framework for Account Aggregators, who will be consent dashboards for the banking industry. A self regulatory organisation, Sahamati, has already been set up with the help of industry members.\nWhat are the risks it poses? While such a framework that is primarily focussed on financial models of incentives and regulations may potentially help empower citizens, such hopes must be juxtaposed with the implementation challenges. Millions of Indian citizens possess low levels of education, with digital literacy a distant dream. In such a context, most users would be unable to truly freely choose whether to share their consent. Unaware of their rights as users and citizens, they may not be able to fully comprehend the implications of consenting to sharing their data, and thus risk a breach of privacy and security.\nFurthermore, progress on reducing the digital divide has been slow. The Centre’s own data says that as of 2020, “more than 15 crore rural households (94% of 16.85 crore households) did not have computers and a significant number of these households were likely to be digitally illiterate”. A 2018 report by the Digital Empowerment Foundation found that pan India digital literacy levels were no more than 10%. Existing schemes also suffer from focusing on knowledge about the use of computers, which fails to adequately address the problem as most indians access the internet through mobile devices.\nA rights centric approach minimises risk, maximises data empowerment Our recommendations are clustered into 4 principle areas. We have cited several peer-reviewed studies and scholarly literature to buttress our claims and welcome further discussion on their merits on the Internet Freedom Forum.\n Consent in the context of citizen’s rights: The policy foregrounds the consent of the user as primary, which is commendable. It is also welcome that the policy envisions multiple pathways for consent manager business models. However, given the relations of dependency that would inevitably develop between consent managers and data users, as well as the mention of an opt-out model for consent in healthcare and banking, further safeguards need to be introduced to ensure the sanctity of informed consent. Additionally, while we recognise that the reversibility of the consent sharing mechanism may vary across sectors, as far as possible citizen’s right to revoke access must be upheld. Here we also strongly recommend against a default, \u0026ldquo;opt-in\u0026rdquo; of consent for which, an, \u0026ldquo;opt-out\u0026rdquo; may not provide for a meaningful safeguard. Ensuring a citizen oriented policy: A strong data protection regime is an expression of commitment to the protection of the rights of citizens - it is not just a matter of a “prevention-of-harm perspective”. Thus, we must refashion our conception of innovation with human welfare and not just financial incentives. Going beyond viewing data as, \u0026ldquo;oil\u0026rdquo; or, a limited, property right, towards a richer conception of digital rights of citizens. For example, while acknowledging the need for increasing access to formal credit, we feel that an increased reliance on Fintech and microlending is not warranted, especially as they can end up having adverse social and economic consequences, and so an alternative usage of the data solicited has to be imagined. **Need for firm regulatory oversight: ** We understand that, given the nascent state of existing infrastructure, DEPA must be given room to grow and innovate. However, such growth must not come at the cost of the rights of citizens. A self-regulatory model may result in a situation where overriding the rights of citizens may be incentivised. Thus, a statutory government regulator such as the proposed Data Protection Authority must oversee compliance and set data standards, especially as the policy itself contemplates a large usage of DEPA in the financial sector where self-regulation has been proven to have deleterious effects. The nature of consent managerial organisations must also be clarified in greater details as to whether it is proposed they would on specific functions fall within the jurisdiction of data and financial regulators. Role of civil society: It is welcomed that civil society is provided with a clear and substantive role in the proposed framework. However, its current role seems to be envisioned to be something along the lines of a post facto alarm bell to ensure the protection of digital rights. Firstly, while civil society must, of course, play a role in this, it is vital that the proposed Data Protection Authority steps in to definitively monitor such violations or at the least creates a body that would do so. Additionally, civil society organisations should be given a more direct consultative role in the creation of DEPA, as they may provide valuable inputs on the process.

After successive rounds of litigation before the Supreme Court, 4G mobile internet access was restored in 2 out of 20 districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 16 August 2020 but there has been no further relaxation of restrictions since then. Meanwhile, non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee remains a problem in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which must be decided by the Supreme Court to ensure independent application of mind by these bodies and implementation of their recommendations.\nBackground Today, the Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir Government is expected to issue another order under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 either extending or modifying the internet restrictions imposed in the region. All communication services were first snapped on 05 August 2019, and so far, 4G mobile internet access has only been restored in 2 districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir, which are Ganderbal and Udhampur. In the remaining 18 districts, mobile internet speed is still being slowed down to 2G which is insufficient to support most modern websites and applications. Due to slow internet speed, the residents of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have been unable to access online education, telemedicine and work from home facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n  \u0026ldquo;Students in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have been the worst hit by the internet slowdown.\u0026rdquo;\n  The internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have been the subject of successive rounds of litigation, with the most recent being the contempt petition and application for directions filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) earlier this year. On 11 May 2020, the Supreme Court had constituted a Special Committee comprising (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, (ii) Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, and (iii) Chief Secretary, Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to immediately review the 4G mobile internet ban. Since there was no information available in the public domain about the functioning of the Special Committee, FMP was constrained to file a contempt petition before the Supreme Court again on 09 June 2020.\nDuring the course of hearings in the contempt petition, the government revealed that the Special Committee had held two meetings since its constitution on 15 May 2020 and 10 June 2020, and it had decided to defer the issue for two months since the security situation was allegedly not conducive to relaxation of internet restrictions. On 11 August 2020, the government stated that the Special Committee held its third meeting on 10 August 2020 where it found that the threat perception in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir continues to be high and that internet speed restrictions did not have any impact on COVID-19 control measures, education or business. However, the Special Committee agreed that 4G mobile internet can be restored in select low risk areas. This recommendation was put into effect by the Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir Government on 16 August 2020 when it restored 4G mobile internet access in one district of Kashmir and one district of Jammu each.\nPending Supreme Court judgement The contempt petition filed by FMP was disposed off by the Supreme Court on 11 August 2020 after the Union Government provided information about the meetings of the Special Committee and agreed to staggered 4G restoration in low risk areas. However, the application for directions filed by FMP was kept pending since it highlighted unresolved problems about non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee and lack of periodic review.\nIn its written reply filed on 25 August 2020, the Union Government has claimed that there exists no legal obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, and publication is necessary only for orders issued by the Home Secretary. In its rejoinder submissions, FMP has asserted that an obligation to publish orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee flows from Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The rejoinder submissions were filed by FMP on 13 October 2020 and we are still awaiting the judgement of the Supreme Court on the issue of publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee.\nIn the meanwhile, the Special Committee was also supposed to examine the outcome of trial restoration of 4G mobile internet access in Ganderbal and Udhampur after two months as per the additional affidavit filed by the Union Government. Since 4G mobile internet was restored in these districts on 16 August 2020, the Special Committee should have held another meeting on or before 16 October 2020 but no information is available in the public domain about when such a meeting was held and whether any further relaxation of internet restrictions was recommended. The orders issued by the Home Secretary of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir Government on 21 October 2020 and 12 November 2020 reference a meeting of the Special Committee but they don\u0026rsquo;t provide more specific information.\nWhy is publication of review orders necessary? (i) Implementation\nThe process of review by the Review Committee and the Special Committee is intended to serve as a robust procedural safeguard against arbitrary and disproportionate use of internet shutdowns. However, without disclosure of the recommendations issued by the Review Committee and the Special Committee, it is impossible for the general public to obtain any information about the outcome of these review processes and whether their recommendations are actually being implemented.\nConcerns exist about implementation of the recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee because these bodies performs an advisory role and their findings are not binding in nature. Publication of recommendations of the Review Committee and the Special Committee is the only way to determine if their findings are being implemented, and such bare minimum transparency is necessary to enable aggrieved individuals to seek judicial remedy if their findings are being disregarded. The existence of two separate committees entrusted with the same function of reviewing internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir makes disclosure of recommendations even more important because otherwise, it is impossible for the public to know whether the findings of the two committees were consistent with each other and what were the reasons for disagreement, if any.\n(ii) Independent application of mind\nThe Union Government has claimed that publication of orders of the Review Committee is not necessary since it is not a “new statutory order or directions” under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. However, the order issued by the Review Committee cannot be considered a mere extension of the order issued by the Home Secretary since such an interpretation would negate the Review Committee’s role as an oversight body which is expected to independently apply its mind to the facts underlying suspension orders.\nUnder Rule 2(6) of the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, the Review Committee is required to determine if the prevailing situation in an area satisfies the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, which can be invoked only on the occurrence of a public emergency or in the interest of public safety. In order to arrive at this determination, the Review Committee presumably evaluates all relevant material including but not limited to district wise figures of terrorism related incidents, latest information about the impact of internet restrictions and any changes in threat levels between the issuance of the suspension order and the date of review.\nThe examination of such material by the Review Committee is essential since the Supreme Court has unequivocally held that the geographical and temporal scope of internet restrictions must be narrowly tailored to what is absolutely necessary to combat an emergent situation. Therefore, if the Review Committee is functioning in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions, its orders will provide additional facts and reasoning, and they cannot be considered a mere repetition of the contents of the suspension order issued by the Home Secretary.\nImportant Documents  Rejoinder Submissions dated 13.10.2020 filed by FMP (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/non-publication-of-internet-shutdown-review-orders/","summary":"Non-publication of orders issued by the Review Committee and Special Committee continues to remain a problem in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which must be decided by the Supreme Court to ensure independent application of mind by these bodies and implementation of their recommendations.","title":"As internet restrictions in J\u0026K cross 480 days, we await SC judgement #KeepUsOnline"},{"content":"  Tl;dr The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is considering a revolutionary legislative proposal. To strengthen its process we have requested for two things. First, we have humbly requested the Joint Parliamentary Committee to work within its mandate and not be distracted by extraneous issues such as content takedowns of Kunal Kamra\u0026rsquo;s tweets. Second, to provide a fuller perspective, we have asked the Joint Parliamentary Committee to consider more consultations with civil society who at present are only 10% of the total number of witnesses examined for depositions.\nMandate of the Joint Parliamentary Committee The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) was constituted to examine The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB). According to press reports, the Committee recently questioned the social media platform Twitter over a recent tweet by comedian Kunal Kamra on which the Ld. the Attorney General of India has granted consent for initiation of contempt proceedings.\nGiven the mandate and the volume of work to be considered by this Committee, such an action may fall beyond the ambit of the JPC. Further, the Standing Committee of Information Technology already exists and is more than capable of scrutinising such complex matters that involve issues of intermediary liability and content takedowns, it is better if such matter are left to the Standing Committee so that the JPC can fulfil the crucial task of providing a robust framework for the processing of data. This is a tremendous task and there are high public expectations that the JPC will act to safeguard user privacy through this path breaking legislation.\nRegardless, on the issue of takedowns, as at present there is an absence of a legal order requiring any such action as per the Shreya Singhal decision of the Supreme Court of India. We have witnessed such a situation Twitter itself before, as we noted in a joint letter endorsed by 243 lawyers when Twitter took down a tweet by Shri Prashant Bhushan (link).\nNeed for more diverse consultations The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is an extremely important piece of legislation, and thus the holding of consultations with stakeholders is welcomed. However, as of 20th November 2020, of the 30 consultations held, 19 (63%) had been with industry bodies. Meanwhile, only 3 (10%) consultations have been held with a civil society organisation. Thus, we request the JPC that in the future it hold further consultations with academics, civil society, digital rights experts and organisations, and technologists.\n  Such groups can offer not only domain expertise but also a unique perspective on how best to regulate the processing of data beyond large technology companies or government departments. By helping the JPC understand how best to not only comprehensively protect the digital rights of the citizens but also ensure that social and economic justice are enshrined in our legislative framework, they can perform an important function and help build a more robust data protection law.\n*Kindly note that the Letter dated November 24, 2020 contains an inadvertent error where the name of the chairperson should be spelt as, \u0026ldquo;Meenakshi Lekhi\u0026rdquo;.

As more and more enterprises begin to adopt work-from-home policies, it is imperative that digital security is accorded the importance it deserves by beefing up the legislative framework for it. This would involve strengthening Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.\nRecent Data Breaches On 9th November, various news portals reported that the online grocery delivery platform BigBasket had experienced a massive data breach involving the information of around 2 crore users on 30th October. While the company said that financial data was secure, information such as full names, passwords, contact numbers, addresses, date of birth, IP addresses, and locations had been hacked and were being sold online.\nThis was just the latest in a spate of many recent hacks in India. According to the Indian government, 2019 witnessed 1,05,849 cyber security incidents (including phishing, network scanning and probing, virus / malicious code and website hacking) in just the first five months. 2019 and 2020 (til August) saw 54 and 37 Central and state government websites hacked respectively. Leaks in Aadhar data, banking data, and credit card information have also increased. Even nuclear plants, such as the one in Kudankulam, have been shown to be vulnerable. Below, we will discuss examples of large sectors from across different sectors.\n  Banking: In January 2019, an SBI server in Mumbai was shown to be unsecured and vulnerable, exposing the data of millions of its customers. The server was not password protected, and so information such as account balances, mobile numbers, and even account numbers were effectively on display. SBI secured the server soon afterwards, but this incident emphasised the need for improving digital infrastructure in the banking sector.\n  Aadhaar: The World Bank and certain digital security firms reported that in 2018 the Aadhar data of citizens was being sold online, with almost a billion users being affected in just the first few months of 2018. These leaks were a mixture of overt hacks and unprotected servers or leaky government websites. For example, in 2019 the Jharkhand government\u0026rsquo;s website displayed the Aadhar details of around 100,000 government workers.\n  Whatsapp Pegasus: In 2019, it was reported the Israeli firm NSOs software Pegasus was being used to spy on 19 individuals, including journalists and human rights activists. By hacking into their devices via a simple missed call, the attackers gained complete access to the individual\u0026rsquo;s data, including locations, passwords, and even the ability to turn cameras and microphones on.\n  Healthcare: In 2019, a US cybersecurity firm reported that an unnamed Indian healthcare website was hacked, with the hackers stealing the data of 68 lakh patients and doctors. The stolen information included patient details, patient case history, doctor information, and other personal information.\n  Credit and debit cards: In October 2019, a Singapore based cybersecurity firm reported that 13 lakh credit and debit card details had been stolen, and were now on sale online. It ws reported that it was likely that this data stolen by placing a magentic stripe in an ATM that was able to copy the information of the user\u0026rsquo;s card.\n  Furthemore, as the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the greater usage of the work-from-home set-up, enterprises too feel that digital infrastructure has to be upgraded to deal with new security challenges, as 66% of Indian firms have reported at least one data breach since they shifted to working from home. Given that organisations faced a cost of Rs. 14 crore on average per data breach in 2019-20, it is clear that data security processes need further tightening and regulation.\nPDPB in context The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (PDPB) contains several clauses relating to security and breaches. For example, Clause 24 of the PDPB asks data fiduciaries and data processors to implement safeguards for several purposes, including \u0026ldquo;to prevent misuse, unauthorised access to, modification, disclosure or destruction of personal data\u0026rdquo;. Clause 25 deals the breach of personal data breaches. The clause states that in cases where a data breach may cause harm to the data principal, the data fiduciary must inform the proposed Data Protection Authority, but informing the data principal has not been mandated. It is then left to the Authority to decide: a) whether the data fiduciary must inform the data principal, b) the remedial action the data fiduciary must undertake, and c) the details of the data breach that can be made public.\nFurther, Clause 50 states that the Data Protection Authority may specify codes of practice for data processors and data fiduciaries, including any security standards have to be maintained as required by Clause 24.\nCurrently in review with the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, the bill is going through a clause-by-clause consultation as per media reports. However, questions have been raised over the conduct of the committee. Parliamentarian Derik O\u0026rsquo;Brien has written a letter saying \u0026ldquo;It is of serious concern that the committee is considering clause by clause consideration of the contents of the Bill before completing its consultation with the stakeholders\u0026rdquo; as reported in the Hindu. Concerns have also been raised about a lack of engagement with tech policy groups and civil society.\nOur recommendation While certain provisions are welcome, they may not adequately address the issues. India faces the twin problems of low capacity levels and weak and unsecure infrastructure. As witnessed in several instances, attackers may not even have to encounter a basic firewall to access personal data, while even those firms which do have a relatively better security infrastructure remain susceptible to attacks. Thus, it is imperative that the regulatory framework for security be robust.To this end, a private member Bill (the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019) introduced by MP D. Ravikumar may provide solutions. For example, clause 19(3) says that prior to disclosure data controllers must explicitly inform the data subject about \u0026ldquo;the security practices and other safeguards, if any, to which personal data shall be subject to\u0026rdquo;. The bill also guarantees data subjects the right to be informed about any breaches of their personal information, and also asks organisation to designate privacy officers to ensure security compliance.\nImportant Documents  The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 as introduced by the Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad (link) The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 as introduced as a private members bill by Mr. D.

The legal notice challenges the CIC\u0026rsquo;s refusal to let Mr. Das attend the show cause hearing in his complaint which seeks action against government officials who claim to have no information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app . The show cause hearing is scheduled for November 24, 2020 i.e. tomorrow and government officials from MeitY, NeGD and NIC have been summoned to explain why they should not be penalized under the RTI Act for obstructing access to information by providing evasive replies. Denying a complainant the right to attend proceedings in his own case is a gross violation of principles of natural justice and such actions go against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act.\nBackground On August 01, 2020, RTI activist and independent journalist, Saurav Das filed RTIs with the Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (MeitY) and its National E-Governance Division (NeGD) seeking information about the creation of the Aarogya Setu app. The RTI applications sought a copy of the entire file relating to Aarogya Setu which would contain information about the origin of the proposal, people and government departments involved, correspondence between private sector executives and government officials, file notings, minutes of meetings etc.\nOn September 10, 2020, Mr. Das filed a complaint before the Central Information Commission (CIC) because the public information officers of MeitY and NeGD failed to provide any meaningful reply to his RTI applications. Prior to this, the National Informatics Centre (NIC) had also stated that it does not have any information about Aarogya Setu. An urgent hearing was held before the CIC on October 22, 2020 because the Aarogya Setu app could affect the privacy of millions of Indians during the COVID-19 pandemic and irreversible harm would be caused if the usual wait time of 2 years was insisted upon.\nDuring this hearing on October 22, 2020, the CIC heard Mr. Das\u0026rsquo;s submissions about the conduct of government officials who were providing evasive responses about Aarogya Setu to frustrate RTI applicants. When questioned by the CIC, public information officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC could not explain which government department held all information related to creation of Aarogya Setu. In its interim order, the CIC held that denial of information by government authorities in such manner could not be accepted and while files may move between departments, \u0026ldquo;a citizen cannot go round in circles to find out the custodian.\u0026quot;\nViolation of principles of natural justice The interim order issued by the CIC directed public information officers from MeitY, NeGD and NIC to appear for a show cause hearing on November 24, 2020 to explain why penalty under Section 20 of the RTI Act should not be imposed on them for prima facie obstruction of information and providing an evasive reply. The CIC also directed the public information officers to send copies of all documents they intend to rely upon during the hearing at least five days in advance.\nDespite multiple requests, the CIC has denied the complainant, Mr. Das permission to attend the show cause hearing scheduled on November 24, 2020 and he has not been provided access to the documents being submitted by government officials either. In response to his requests, the Registry has merely stated that the show cause hearing is a “matter between the Commission and the respondents and the presence of the complainant is not required.” Mr. Das has not been provided the video conferencing details for the show cause hearing, and was instead told that a copy of the order issued by the CIC would be shared with him after the show cause hearing was over. However, the order issued by the CIC may not reflect the entirety of the submissions made by government officials before it, and there would be no way for Mr. Das to reply to any contentions taken in real time.\nDenying a complainant the right to attend proceedings in his own case is a gross violation of principles of natural justice and such actions go against the letter and spirit of the RTI Act. Furthermore, Mr. Das has not been provided access to the material being submitted by government officials to the CIC, which has severely hampered his ability to prosecute his complaint. Unless he is provided access to the written and oral submissions made by the government officials, he cannot ascertain the veracity of their justifications or rebut their claims by producing contrary evidence.\nLegal notice to the Commission On November 19, 2020, we sent a legal notice to the CIC on behalf of Mr. Das which emphasized that the RTI Act 2005 and the RTI Rules 2012 do not contain any provision which would support the Registry\u0026rsquo;s stance. In fact, Rule 12 of the RTI Rules 2012 actually requires the CIC to provide a hearing to appellants through video conferencing. The legal notice further notes that while undertaking any kind of quasi-judicial action or administrative action with civil consequences, authorities must comply with principles of natural justice and provide the aggrieved person access to relevant material and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\nIn view of the above, the legal notice seeks immediate course correction by the CIC and raises the following three demands:\n Allow Mr. Das to attend the show cause hearing scheduled on 24 November 2020 by sharing venue details for the video conferencing or the video conferencing link. Provide Mr. Das access to all written material submitted by government officials to the CIC in relation to his complaint and the show-cause notice issued by the CIC. Refrain from taking any final decision about Mr. Das’s complaint without providing him an opportunity to be heard.  RTI activist, Saurav Das\u0026rsquo;s view IFF was able to assist Mr. Das with this legal notice and here is what he had to say about this headline grabbing case which has implications for the privacy of millions of Indian citizens.\n “In any democracy if the makers of a heavily marketed government app are unknown, it would cause a huge uproar. The same happened in India when the CIC lambasted the central govt for failing to provide me details about the making of this app. Since then, the NIC and Ministry have been submitting information to the CIC in response to the show cause notice in my case. However, it has been wrapped in secrecy. So much so that even I am not being allowed to witness my own case. It is extremely important that the Appellant or complainant is allowed to witness his own case proceedings to ensure that the concerned officers do not mislead the Commission into believing something that may not be entirely true. The right to rebut their points is my legal right and will only help the Commission reach a fair decision. But a failure to do so is nothing short of a violation of principles of natural justice and is adverse to my case. I have been told this is their normal way of operating. I am shocked that nobody has challenged this arbitrary, illegal, opaque system of hearing, ironically, at the transparency commission. This needs to change now.”\n Important Documents  Legal Notice sent by Saurav Das to CIC (link) Interim Order dated 26.10.2020 issued by CIC (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/cic-legal-notice-aarogya-setu-show-cause-hearing/","summary":"We sent a legal notice to the Central Information Commission challenging its refusal to let RTI activist, Saurav Das attend the show cause hearing in his complaint which seeks information about creation of the Aarogya Setu app.","title":"Govt officials to justify denial of information about Aarogya Setu in secret hearing before CIC #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  On October 11, 2020 India became a signatory to the “International statement: End-to-end encryption and public safety”. Interalia the statement calls on technology companies to weaken end to end encrypted secure messaging by invoking concerns about public safety by stating, “enable law enforcement access to content in a readable and usable format”.\nIndia is one of the 7 known signatory countries. This is a concerning development because the use of encryption has again come under political attack by parts of the security ecosystem. In fact, failure to encourage and expand the usage of encryption technologies puts individual users at risk. Here millions of Indians who today conduct their lives through digital tools are also entry point vulnerabilities unless their devices are secured through encryption. It is our belief that strong encryption is necessary to protect the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and government actors who use the internet, and this is especially true for groups which lack social power such as women and other marginalised communities. Any weakening of encryption standards would leave us all vulnerable to misuse of our personal data and communications by bad actors including malicious hackers, organised criminals, terrorist groups and hostile nation states.\nConcerned by this development after it was brought to our notice by an IFF Forum Member, we filed Right to Information requests with the Ministries of Home Affairs, External Affairs and Electronics \u0026amp; IT asking them about India’s involvement in the Statement.\nIn a reply dated November 13, 2020, the Central Public Information Officer \u0026amp; Legal Officer of the Ministry of External Affairs’ Legal \u0026amp; Treaties Division, Mr. Sudheer K.J., has stated that,\n “\u0026hellip; we could neither trace any records under the jurisdiction of this CPIO nor could identify any other public authority which may possess related information pertaining to the subject matter of the query\u0026hellip;”.\n This response as well as a failure to identify other relevant public authorities to transfer the application to is indicative of either one of two situations. First, information under the RTI act is being withheld with respect to a matter that squarely falls within the ambit of public interest. Or, second, there is an absence of a proper coordination or consultation with the principal ministerial office, i.e. the Ministry of External Affairs as to an international statement. Either inference is troubling since the statement undermines the fundamental right to informational privacy that is preserved through end-to-end encryption.\nIn the first situation, we urge for immediate disclosure and in the second urge for greater coordination between the ministerial offices within the Union Government to examine the reasons and state them publicly on what prompted it’s assent to this international statement. Here, it should be noted that that in the unlikely outcome that assent to this statement was not on the basis of proper consultation within government offices, an urgent review must be conducted and a rights based assessment may be adopted after obtaining a legal opinion on the consistency of this international statement with the constitutional articulation of the fundamental right to privacy.\nImportant documents  “International statement: End-to-end encryption and public safety” dated October 11, 2020 (link) IFF Forum Member post “Yet another call for E2E backdoors\u0026quot; dated October 11, 2020 (link) Right to Information requests filed with MEA, MHA and MeitY dated October 13, 2020 (link) Reply received from MEA dated November 13, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/statement-on-meas-rti-response-on-international-statement-on-e2e-encryption/","summary":"MEA\u0026rsquo;s RTI response states that they do not hold any information pertaining to the Statement nor can they identify any other authority to transfer it to which raises multiple concerns.","title":"Statement on MEA's RTI response on International Statement on E2E Encryption"},{"content":"  Tl;dr IFF has submitted it\u0026rsquo;s comments on the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology\u0026rsquo;s Draft Data Centre Policy 2020. In our comments, we specified four issues that we felt the draft policy must address: firstly, that data centres must implement robust security protocols; secondly, that data centres must ensure that the digital rights of users are not violated; thirdly, firm and unambiguous regulatory oversight must provided; and lastly, that data centres should not be brought under the ambit of the Essential Services Maintenance Act, 1968 (ESMA).\nDraft Data Centre Policy As the modern indian economy moves further towards digitalisation, upgrading the country\u0026rsquo;s data capacities and enabling the rapid growth of data facilities takes on vital importance. However, to ensure that this truly done in a manner that best serves the nation, it is crucial that rights of the users (i.e. citizens) be safeguarded.\nSeveral leaks have plagues the country in recent times. According to the Indian government, 2019 witnessed 1,05,849 cyber security incidents in just the first five months. 2019 and 2020 (til August) saw 54 and 37 Central and state government websites hacked respectively. Leaks in Aadhar data, banking data, and credit card information have also increased. Even nuclear plants, such as the one in Kudankulam, have been shown to be vulnerable. Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic driven move towards working from home proceeds further, enterprises too feel that digital infrastructure has to be upgraded to deal with new security challenges, as 66% of Indian firms have reported at least one data breach since they shifted to working from home. Given that organisations faced a cost of Rs. 14 crore on average per data breach in 2019-20, it is clear that data security processes need further tightening and regulation.\nAn additional factor to be considered here is Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, as the regulation of the operations of data centres will certainly come under the ambit of this bill. The bill faced multiple criticisms both inside and outside Parliament, as certain clauses of the Bill proved to be contentious - especially since they differed from the recommendations of the Justice Srikrishna Committee - and so the bill was sent to a Standing Committee for review. The key issues in the bill included the exemptions given to the government for the processing of data, the composition of the proposed Data Protection Authority, and the non-consensual processing of data. A private member bill introduced by MP Dr. D Ravikumar, for example, is an alternative that addresses these issues.\nIn light of this, it is imperative that strict guidelines for ensuring the security and privacy of users be protected, as these will ensure that the data of swathes of citizens is safe. Additionally, a firm and strictly defined regulatory framework should be laid down, and the fundamental right to expression of data centre workers not be tampered with. Doing will so will not only ensure that the growth of India\u0026rsquo;s digital infrastructure benefits citizens but also cement India\u0026rsquo;s position as a global hub for digital infrastructure.\nOur submissions   Security: The draft policy does not specify any security standards that data centres must adhere to, or may be prescribed in future by the Data Protection Authority. There is a tangible need to address this given the several big data leaks that have plagued the country recently. This is a situation exacerbated by the fact that due to the COVID-19 pandemic many companies have moved towards a work-from-home set-up, which has meant a greater degree of digitalisation and so a greater need to ensure digital security. In light of this, we feel it is important for the Policy to firmly lay down, at the very least, a broad framework for ensuring the protection of data.\n  Privacy and digital rights: The policy does not mention the method in which data centres will ensure they protect the digital rights of users. If it is contemplated that such issues are to be covered under the proposed Data Protection Bill, 2019, then a method for ensuring compliance with the same must be specified.\n  Need for firm regulatory oversight: There should be a clear and unequivocal acknowledgement within the policy for oversight by the Data Protection Authority contemplated by the impending Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. Here ideally the primary mandate of the Inter-Ministerial Empowered Committee (along with the Data Centre Facilitation Unit) should be confined to facilitating the ease of doing business and any overlap with the Data Protection Authority should be limited.\n  Imposition of Essential Services Maintenance Act: While we recognise the importance of digital infrastructure for both the modern economy and modern governance, we feel that the inclusion of data centres under Essential Services Maintenance Act, 1968 (ESMA) may be a step too far. The draft policy does not provide sufficient arguments for why data centres should be considered essential. Additionally, employees’ right to freedom of expression is fundamental, and ESMA puts significant curbs on it. The Act has already faced criticism, especially for its granting of the power to arrest without a warrant.\n  Important Documents  MEITY\u0026rsquo;s Draft Data Centre Policy 2020 (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s comments on the Draft Data Centre Policy 2020 (link) The Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 as introduced by Dr. D Ravikumar, MP (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/ensuring-security-and-the-protection-of-privacy-in-data-centres/","summary":"IFF has sent its comments to the MEITY on the Draft Data Centre Policy.

Concerns have been raised about misuse and breach of sensitive personal data collected by the app and legal experts have cautioned against deployment of such technologies in the absence of a data protection law in India. Public health experts have also explained why such apps cannot substitute on the ground contract tracing by healthcare workers and questioned the government\u0026rsquo;s failure to explain why information available through existing databases is insufficient. Finally, technologists have warned that Aarogya Setu relies on weak anonymization techniques which make its users susceptible to re-identification and criticized the lack of transparency surrounding the app\u0026rsquo;s code and algorithms.\nStop the Voluntary-Mandatory Game The central government has repeatedly claimed that use of the Aarogya Setu app is voluntary but ground realities paint a very different picture. We have been closely tracking mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu by different institutions including airports, court complexes and resident welfare associations. Most recently, our alarm bells were rung by a circular issued by the Delhi Government\u0026rsquo;s Department of Excise on 27 October 2020 which directed licensed wholesale liquor vendors to ensure “mandatory use of Aarogya Setu app by every worker.” The circular further stated that Bond Inspectors are required to ensure compliance with this direction and submit a certificate within 3 days.\nIn our representation, we have called upon the Delhi Government to withdraw the circular issued by the Excise Department mandating use of the Aarogya Setu app by liquor store workers. We have also sought issuance of an advisory to all departments of the Government of NCT of Delhi clarifying that use of the Aarogya Setu app is purely voluntary and no person should be denied access to goods or services for failing to use the app. In support of these demands, we have highlighted the following concerns about legality and effectiveness of the Aarogya Setu app and explained how its mandatory imposition could lead to privacy violations and exclusion.\n(IL)Legality Despite collecting sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians, the Aarogya Setu app lacks any legislative basis and powers have not been provided under any statutory instrument to mandate use of the app. In an interview with the Indian Express, Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection constituted by the MeitY has endorsed this view and stated that making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory without enabling legislation is completely illegal. Mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu amounts to an infringement of fundamental rights of citizens because it could lead to privacy violations and exclusion, and therefore, such a measure must be supported by legislative authorization.\nInaccuracy and Ineffectiveness In addition to these legal concerns, mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app may prove to be counterproductive at achieving its intended purpose of reducing COVID-19 transmission because of the inaccuracies inherent in app based contact tracing. Apps like Aarogya Setu rely on Bluetooth and GPS signals which cannot accurately estimate whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) of a COVID-19 infected person, and this can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives. For instance, Bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since Bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives and provide a false sense of security to infected individuals.\nPast Central Government Practice It should be noted that authorities of the central government have also recognized that use of the Aarogya Setu app cannot be made mandatory for workers. For instance, on 01 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued guidelines which made use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees and the head of an organization was responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among all employees. After this decision was challenged before the Kerala High Court, MHA issued revised guidelines on 17 May 2020 which encouraged use of the Aarogya Setu app on a \u0026ldquo;best efforts\u0026rdquo; basis but stopped short of making it mandatory.\nMore recently on 22 August 2020, MeitY launched an Open API Service to enable employers to receive real-time information about the risk status of their employees, customers and users. However, the Terms of Service of the Open API Service clearly state that explicit consent of the user is necessary to access data collected by the Aarogya Setu app and alternative methods to avail a service must be provided to users who do not grant such consent.\nImportant Documents  Representation dated 18.01.2020 to Delhi Government (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;Multi-domain orgs and individuals raise concerns about Aarogya Setu\u0026rsquo; dated 18 September 2020 (link) Previous post titled \u0026lsquo;Victory!

This amendment represents a missed opportunity for wider reform because it fails to incorporate directions issued by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India requiring proactive publication of internet shutdown orders and periodic review by the Review Committee every seven working days. Further, the choice of 15 days as the appropriate length of time for the validity of a suspension order will limit the utility of the recent amendment since most internet shutdowns do not last 15 days. Finally, the amendment was notified without any public consultation and the government cannot shirk its duty to comprehensively evaluate and reform the legal framework for internet shutdowns by implementing such cosmetic changes.\nWhat is the legal procedure for ordering internet shutdowns? On 10 November 2020, the Central Government issued a gazette notification inserting Rule 2A into the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017. The newly inserted Rule 2A states that “the suspension order issued by the competent authority under sub-rule (1) shall not be in operation for more than fifteen days.” Before we analyse the impact of this amendment, we must first understand the legal framework for internet shutdowns in India. Prior to 2017, internet shutdowns were routinely ordered by District Magistrates under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. However, as the Supreme Court has noted in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the legal position changed after the Telecom Suspension Rules were notified in 2017 and “with the promulgation of the Suspension Rules, the States are using the aforesaid Rules to restrict telecom services including access to the internet.”\nUnder Rule 2(1) of the Telecom Suspension Rules, an internet shutdown order should be issued by the Home Secretary of the central or state government. Under Rule 2(6) of the Telecom Suspension Rules, the central or state level Review Committee is required to review internet shutdown orders issued by the Home Secretary within five working days and determine whether the orders demonstrate a ‘public emergency’ or threat to ‘public safety’ under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. These limited procedural safeguards present in the text of the Telecom Suspension Rules were found to be inadequate by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, and additional requirements were read into the Rules by the judiciary to perform a gap filling role till the legislature stepped in. In particular, the Supreme Court issued directions requiring (a) proactive publication, (b) time limitation and (c) periodic review of internet shutdown orders.\n    [Extracts from judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India]\nThe final position which emerges upon reading Rule 2(6) of the Telecom Suspension Rules with the judgement of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India is that an internet shutdown order must be reviewed by the Review Committee within five working days of its issuance and it should subsequently be reviewed every seven working days from the date of the last review. With insertion of Rule 2A, this would mean that each internet shutdown order should be reviewed only once by the Review Committee during its 15 day life span. For instance, if an internet shutdown order was issued today i.e. 12 November 2020, it could only remain in operation till 26 November 2020 (15 days time limit under Rule 2A). If we assume Saturday and Sunday to be non-working days, the order would have to be reviewed by the Review Committee but only once on 18 November 2020 (first review within five working days under Rule 2(6)) since the second review would be due on 27 November (periodic review after every seven working days of last review as per Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India) by when the order would have expired.\nAmendment represents missed opportunity for wider reform By limiting the duration of each suspension order to 15 days, the recent amendment provides statutory recognition to the Supreme Court’s direction that internet shutdowns must be temporary only and any indefinite suspension of telecom services is not permissible under the law. However, the amendment fails to incorporate other directions issued by the Supreme Court requiring proactive publication of internet shutdown orders and periodic review by the Review Committee every seven working days from the date of the last review.\n**(i) Fails to promote compliance with Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India**As we have uncovered through the RTI Act, compliance by state governments with the judgment of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India remains low. For instance, several state governments have imposed internet shutdowns in 2020 without publishing the underlying orders and they have even refused to provide this information in response to RTI applications. Therefore, the recent amendment represents a missed opportunity to incorporate proactive publication and periodic review as a mandatory duty within the text of the Telecom Suspension Rules which would have increased awareness about these judicially introduced requirements and boosted compliance by state governments.\n(ii) Adopts prolonged internet shutdowns as the baselineThe choice of 15 days as the appropriate length of time for the validity of an internet shutdown order will limit the utility of the recent amendment. While regions like Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and Darjeeling, West Bengal have experienced very prolonged restrictions, most internet shutdowns in India do not last for 15 days. Therefore, the amendment appears to have been drafted using extreme cases as the baseline and it will not create any additional obligations for government authorities in the vast majority of cases. Even in regions like Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir, the amendment may lead to a nominal increase in paperwork for government officials who will have to issue orders more frequently to extend the ongoing internet shutdown but it does not prevent the government from routinely issuing boilerplate orders every 15 days.\n(iii) Lack of stakeholder consultation and public participation While reform of the Telecom Suspension Rules is undoubtedly necessary, such an exercise will not be meaningful unless it is preceded by stakeholder engagement and public consultation. On 06 February 2020, the Minister of State for Communications had stated in Rajya Sabha that the central government will review the Telecom Suspension Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India. Earlier this year, IFF had also written to the Department of Telecommunications and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to follow up on this assurance and urged the government to commence the public consultation process for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules. However, till date, this promise has not been fulfilled and Rule 2A was unilaterally inserted into Telecom Suspension Rules without any stakeholder consultation or public participation.\nIn conclusion, the recent amendments to the Telecom Suspension Rules may be characterized as a bandaid applied on a bullet wound which does little to prevent the patient from bleeding out. The central government cannot shirk its duty to comprehensively evaluate and reform the legal framework for internet shutdowns by implementing such cosmetic changes. Most importantly, any credible legal reform process should involve public consultation and it must also address wider problems such as economic damage caused by internet shutdowns and the ineffectiveness of internet shutdowns at preventing violence.\nImportant Links  Gazette notification dated 10.11.2020 issued by DoT amending Telecom Suspension Rules (link) Judgement of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v.

The notification essentially means that MIB will have principal jurisdiction over, first online news and current affairs content and second films and audiovisual programmes made available by online content providers (also called OTT providers).\nSo the question arises what does this change mean? And second, why is there a level of apprehension that arises due to it?\nWhat does it mean? Here it is first important to take a step back and consider the role the MIB has played conventionally. It has administered both licensing and content censorship powers in the radio, cinema and television broadcasting specifically through laws such as the Cinematograph Act and the Cable Television Regulations Act. Hence, it has an institutional history of regulation.\nThis has been done both with respect to entities are permitted to operate within certain sectors of news and general entertainment but also indirectly exercised governance over content. For instance film certification which is popularly known as being done through censor boards. Now, the online content sector is also enveloped within the ambit of the MIB somewhat similarly to radio, cinema and television. However, there is largely an absence of legislation that may require either licensing or a form of content certification like for movies.\nWhy the nervousness? We all know the internet is a very different medium than cinemas or theaters. It presents different challenges and opportunities. Here there exists a level of nervousness as to whether today’s notification can be a precursor to any form of licensing or result in censorship.\n  Online journalism platforms: Here there is a level of anticipation firstly with respect to who all would fall within the ambit of such regulation and what would be its nature. We believe that online media and journalism is vital to our democracy and present innovative models through which specialised services focussing through models of subscriptions or news-letters provide incredible value to end users. Furthermore, even the type of content which may be investigative, or specialised focussing on topical subjects like technology and startups are serving real value and need. Here, there is a degree of nervousness about what shape any potential regulation or a legislation will take. One such measure is the pending process that considers amendments to the Press and Registration of Books Bill, 2019. Now, it’s an open question, whether this, or any other legislative measures, will cause censorship or bring in compliances that while aimed at checking social problems such as, “fake news” may just result in greater government control?\n  Online video streaming platforms (such as Amazon Prime, Disney-Hotstar, Netflix): To be clear this would mark a clear departure from the past stand of principally the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) and joined by the MIB which had in the Justice for Rights Case made a submission that there was no need for regulation under the Cinematograph Act for prior licensing of content. Further, if any complaints arose against online streaming providers then offences under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860 were available. We even sent a letter to MEITY congratulating them for this progressive stand. However, there are signs that such statements may not be equivocal and there may be a Cinematographer style regulation. According to us this would be a very bad idea for freedom of speech and media diversity. It would hurt creators, viewers and the cultural export and local content development of diverse content which is showcasing India’s creative, soft power on the global stage.\n  So in both instances, while nervousness is understandable, please do consider adoption of some caution and paying greater attention to any potential legislative or executive action which may follow. Such policy shifts will be documented by us and we will keep you regularly informed and seek your active participation.\nVigilance and continued liberty At IFF we are committed to serving the constitutional values of free expression that quite often today intersect with digital communication. We believe that any regulation of the online sector which may follow should be grounded in sound public policy choices which carry these values and also serve innovation. Towards this we commit to remaining vigilant, working with associations, groups and bodies and a broad range of stakeholders including the government in good faith. We believe that the opportunities that the online space provides far outweigh the harms and will continue to take all actions to secure the interests of end users.\nImportant Links:  Cabinet Secretariat Notification dated November 11, 2020 regarding the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (link) Submission to the consultation on the Registration of Press and Periodicals Bill, 2019 (link) Representation to the MIB against regulation of OTT streaming platforms dated September 06, 2019 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/statement-on-online-news-media-and-ott-platforms/","summary":"The Central Government has notified the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) as having jurisdiction over online news and also OTT video streaming platforms.","title":"Statement: Today’s notification on online news media and OTT platforms will require greater vigilance #LetUsChill"},{"content":"  tl;dr Responses to Right to Information requests filed with the states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat seeking information about internet shutdowns in these states show that there is a failure to comply with the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in the matter of Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India (2020 SCC OnLine SC 25).\nBackground Post the Anuradha Bhasin decision, we came across multiple media reports wherein it was reported that internet shutdowns were still being done by states without publishing the legal orders under which these internet shutdowns were imposed.\nIn that decision, the Supreme Court, while deciding the constitutionality of the internet shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019, held that all internet shutdown orders must be proactively published by the government.\n “It must be noted that although the Suspension Rules does not provide for publication or notification of the orders, a settled principle of law, and of natural justice, is that an order, particularly one that affects lives, liberty and property of people, must be made available ….

Please provide information with regard to whether an advisory has been issued to all District Magistrates clarifying that internet shutdowns can no longer be imposed under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973.  Responses received A. Andhra Pradesh In their reply dated October 28, 2020, the Police Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh stated that “it is not correct to say as per the Judgment that the internet shutdowns can no longer be imposed u/s 144 Cr.P.C. …” This is in contradiction to the Anuradha Bhasin decision in which, after making note of the Gujarat High Court decision in Gaurav Sureshbhai Vyas v. State of Gujarat which allowed internet shutdowns to be imposed under S.144, Cr.P.C., the Supreme Court stated that the position of law has changed after notification of the Telecom Suspension Rules in 2017. This could be reasonably construed as an implicit finding that telecom suspension orders can no longer be issued under S.144, Cr.P.C.\nB. Gujarat In their reply dated October 14, 2020, the Home Department of the Government of Gujarat stated that the internet shutdown related information that we asked for relates to their department and that they were exempted from disclosure under the RTI Act u/s 24. Section 24 of the RTI Act states that “certain organisations” such as intelligence and security organisations do not come under the purview of the act and can be exempted from disclosure if the government specifically exempts them by notification in the Official Gazette. The Government of Gujarat has accordingly exempted Special Branches of the Home Department from disclosures which acts as a deterrent to demanding transparency for internet shutdowns in the state.\n11 months on, still no compliance with the Anuradha Bhasin decision These responses make it clear that states and the Centre have failed to comply with the Anuradha Bhasin decision due to various reasons, whether it is wilful disobedience or due to signal failure. As we have stated previously, publication of internet shutdown orders and proper record-keeping is essential for two reasons. First, without access to internet shutdown orders, citizens cannot exercise their fundamental right to seek judicial review of arbitrary or disproportionate restrictions on internet access. Second, internet shutdowns cause huge economic losses and maintaining a consolidated record of all internet shutdowns imposed at the state and central level is necessary for evidence based policy reform.\nWithout official publication of orders, the only source of information about internet shutdowns in different parts of the country is media reports. However, the figures derived based on media reports do not represent the full scale of the problem and may fail to include shutdowns which are shorter in duration or localized in small towns and villages.\nIn any case, even the limited information which is available through media reports suggests that internet shutdowns are being ordered by government officials who are not authorized under the law. For instance, media reports indicate that internet shutdowns in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were ordered by District Magistrates who are not empowered to exercise powers under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. Prior to 2017, internet shutdowns were ordered by District Magistrates under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. However, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the Supreme Court has clarified that the position of law has changed after notification of the Rules in 2017 and the procedure prescribed under the Rules must be followed prior to imposing internet shutdowns.\nWhat are we doing? In light of these recent RTI responses as well as due to responses received previously from Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya, IFF has been strategising the foremost way of intervening. We will soon be taking steps to ensure that the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India is complied with.\nImportant documents  Copies of RTI applications, replies and appeals (link) RTI responses from MP and Meghalaya show compliance failure with the Anuradha Bhasin Internet Shutdown decision (link) 6 months after Anuradha Bhasin v.

In our comments, we highlighted three issues that we felt the draft ODR policy must address, namely: firstly, that any new system must ensure that it does not exclude litigants and provides access to judicial remedies for everyone; secondly, that certain outstanding concerns related to data protection must be adressed, and thirdly, that rather than allowing self-regulation the government must step in and provide regulatory oversight.\nDraft ODR Policy The NITI Aayog recently released it\u0026rsquo;s draft report on the proposed ODR Policy. ODR refers not only to an increased role of information and communication technology in facilitating judicial processes but also to a greater use of technology in the mediation and litigation processes themselves. However, the adoption of such technology should not be looked at through the lens of service delivery, and instead should focus on improving the imparting of justice.\nWhile India’s internet penetration is improving, evidence from government reports suggests that the country has a long way to go before attaining universal internet penetration. For example, TRAI’s ‘The Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators January – March, 2020’ report states that India has 743.19 million internet subscribers, which indicates an internet penetration rate of only 55.12%. Rural-urban disparities prevail as indicated by the rural penetration rate of 32.24%, with 285.97 million rural internet subscribers, which is not even one third of the urban penetration rate of 99.12%, with 457.23 million urban internet subscribers. Additionally, 96.9% of all internet subscribers use mobile devices for accessing the internet, which may not be well suited for ODR mediation. Given that around 27,721 villages in India are still not covered by telecom service providers, it is clear India’s digital infrastructure requires further expansion. In such a situation, the introduction of ODR should make sure that judicial rights of the citizens are not affected by technological exclusion or by forcing mediation between parties with unequal access to resources.\nInnovations should always be welcomed, but innovations should also be grounded in the social needs and concerns of society. The existing system has faced certain issues for a long time, and so the use ODR should be directed at adressing these problems. An implementation of ODR that does not take into concerns such as data leakage or unequal bargaining powers between two parties would negatively large masses of the indian citizenry. An effort has to be made to ensure that justice is delivered not just in the metropolitan cities of India but also to the large swathes of Bharat.\nOur submissions  Inclusion and access: Many litigants require a day in court to adequately establish their claim, and technology which can help improve the established processes is sorely needed. However, the level of teleconnectivity, access to high speed internet access, and digital literacy are still aspirational for large segments of the population. To mitigate any impacts on large sections of indian society we recommend that a process of purely optional, voluntary, and step-by-step measures may be adopted to prevent exclusion. This is vital since without internet access many people will lack the means to properly defendntheir claims, which will have adverse legal impacts. Specialised privacy protections by a DPA: We do support the implementation of ODR, especially when it is used to tackle currently existing problems such as delays and a lack of transparency in processes. Further, we recognise and support court data to be largely open data sets meant primarily for legal research. However, we do have some outstanding issues, which we think can be objectively assessed by a specialised Data Protection Authority proposed by the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, especially any possible restrictions on the use of court data that may threaten or endanger individuals. We believe that the detailed examination of such privacy protections should be governed by balancing interests of researchers and open data in a specialised manner to prevent court data becoming another spoke in the larger wheel of surveillance capitalism. Hence, we believe that oversight on privacy related concerns may be regulated under the aegis of the Data Protection Authority. Need for oversight than self-regulation: We recognise the need to encourage growth in a fledgling sector such as ODR, however, given that justice delivery is a core state function that results in binding and legal judgements, it can have a significant impact on individuals. Given that strong private sector incentives towards profit and growth will be predominant they are likely to overtake the actual intent of the initiative of ODR towards providing better delivery of justice and facilitating the mediation experience for litigants, lawyers, and judges. Hence, it is our strong recommendation that, in the absence of any evidence (and we note there is a lack of any evidence cited in the paper) on the adverse impact of a government regulation on private enterprise, a regulatory body (as the report also contemplates legislative changes) or a process of standards, prescription and governance be implemented through the Ministry of Law and Justice.  We also asked that civil society organisations be included in future consultation, as they can provide valuable feedback and alternative perspectives on such matters.\nWe invite you to offer us your comments here.

IFF aims to increase transparency around the implementation and use of FRT projects through the introduction of a digital public resource. This is being done through the deployment of an online dashboard which displays information gathered and collected on various FRT deployments projects across each state relating to the procurement, implementation and use of facial recognition technology projects by the Government of India, State Governments and public authorities in India.\n  \u0026ldquo;This image is for illustration purposes only.\u0026rdquo;\n  It will be a public resource which will activate informed, evidence based advocacy for legal and technical reforms to protect and advance fundamental rights. This public resource will then be used to drive advocacy on the issue though campaigns and online advocacy. This will enable strategic litigation at the Central and State level by diverse individuals and collectives based on individual harms and injuries that may be suffered by them. The broader aim would be to drive policy changes particularly with regard to data protection legislation in India as well as the introduction of a specific sectoral legislation for facial recognition technology.\nWhat will the platform contain? The resource will essentially be a website which will consist of an interactive map tracking the deployment of FRT systems by the government across the country. The resource will also consist of case studies specific to certain projects which will provide context for the project as well as our Right to Information findings. One of the main features of the website will be that it will be supported by IFF’s considerable RTI resources. IFF has been filing RTI requests asking for information on each project that we come across to create a database of information which will facilitate us in our drive for transparency and accountability. Through these RTIs we have been able to obtain additional information and context around these projects which shines a light on how the government aims to use these FRT systems. The launch of this Project is imminent and we hope that our aim of increasing transparency around the use of this harmful technology in India through this platform is achieved. For this, we also need your help and support. The Project will have the functionality of allowing people who access the website to submit information that they may have come across that we may not have displayed on the platform. You can also help in ensuring that our work in building and maintaining this resource continues by donating to IFF to ensure that we keep fighting the good fight.\nThis project has been built with the help of multiple civic-minded volunteers who donated their time and efforts to us including the teams at DataKind Bangalore and Frappe as well as our amazing design volunteer Shobhit Katikia.\nImportant Documents  Introduction to Facial Recognition Projects in India dated February 17, 2020 (link) Problems with Facial Recognition Technology Operating in a Legal Vacuum dated February 20, 2020 (link) Is the illegal use of facial recognition technology by the Delhi Police akin to mass surveillance?

Pegasus targeted users by exploiting a vulnerability in WhatsApp and it could gain complete access to a device by getting the user to click on a link or through a missed call. The revelations led to widespread outrage especially since the targets of surveillance were human rights defenders and the NSO Group claims that it only sold Pegasus to vetted government entities.\nWhile the central government has evasively denied any involvement with the Pegasus hack, there has been no independent investigation into the matter. After the Pegasus hack became a subject of discussion in Parliament, the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology stated that CERT-IN intended to audit WhatsApp’s systems and had sent a notice to the NSO Group on 26 November 2019 but there have been no further updates from CERT-IN about the status of the investigation. It should be noted that CERT-IN had been alerted by WhatsApp about this security problem in May 2019 but CERT-IN officials claim they did not recognize the seriousness of the issue because the \u0026ldquo;communication was in pure technical jargon without any mention of Israeli Pegasus or the extent of the breach.”\nAt the state level, a panel was also established by the Chhattisgarh Government on 11 November 2019 to investigate the Pegasus hack since at least four of the victims belonged to Chhattisgarh. However, as per media reports, the panel concluded its investigation in January 2020 and it did not find any evidence of police officials purchasing the Pegasus spyware. There exists little or no information in the public domain from the government to confirm this. It is important to note that as per our conversations with the NSO-Pegasus hack victims, none of them have been afforded the opportunity to present their testimonies or appear before this panel. Further, little or no technical analysis has been attempted, and from the institution to the probable conclusion (if any) of this investigation, there is a large level of secrecy. Since a large number of the victims targeted belonged to Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, we had also urged these state governments to initiate an independent investigation which must include testimonies from the victims of the Pegasus hack and experts in the field of data privacy and cyber-security.\nThe only official body which has provided a hearing to the victims of the Pegasus hack so far is the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, which decided to examine the issue after a closely contested vote on 20 November 2019. Immediately prior to this, on 19 November 2019, 17 victims of the Pegasus hack had also written to the Parliamentary Standing Committee requesting it to investigate whether government officials had purchased and deployed Pegasus in India. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs had also agreed to discuss the issue and we wrote to both committees to clarify the legal position on use of spyware in India and highlighted some broader cyber-security related concerns which must be addressed. Subsequently, depositions were made by the victims and subject matter experts on the issue, however any report on the basis of it is awaited.\nDespite multiple government and parliamentary bodies examining the Pegasus hack, a whole year has passed and we still do not know who was responsible for this egregious violation of the privacy of human rights defenders in the country. While investigations have been stalled in India, the lawsuit filed by WhatsApp against the NSO Group in California has witnessed some progress. Most recently, the NSO Group filed an appeal before the Ninth Circuit claiming that WhatsApp’s lawsuit could not succeed since the NSO Group enjoyed derivative foreign sovereign immunity by virtue of its customers being foreign government entities.\nOn this anniversary of the Pegasus hack revelations, we reiterate our support for the human rights defenders who were subjected to this grossly illegal act of surveillance and urge government and parliamentary bodies to bolster efforts in their investigations. The installation of Pegasus was an illegal act as per existing law, specifically provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Such an act calls for seriousness and alarm given that it may set a dangerous precedent on the use of malware and hacking that has put academics, human rights defenders and civil society voices at considerable risk. Since there is a reasonable apprehension that government actors were involved in the Pegasus hack, investigative processes must adhere to the highest standards of independence and transparency. Most importantly, testimonies from actual victims and experts in data privacy and cybersecurity must be heard by bodies examining the Pegasus hack to ensure the real harm suffered and the risk of future occurrences of such incidents are properly addressed.\nToday, we stand in solidarity with them and signal our clear, unequivocal condemnation on the use of Pegasus and the NSO Group.\nImportant Links  Previous post titled ‘Statement: Scary disclosures on use of NSO spyware in India signal a need for urgent reform’ published on 31 October 2019 (link) Previous post titled ‘We provide the Standing Committees on Home Affairs with suggestions as they discuss the Pegasus scandal’ published on 15 November 2019 (link) Previous post titled ‘We ask the Committee on IT to let those targeted by Pegasus be heard!’ published on 21 November 2019 (link) Previous post titled ‘The need to investigate the NSO Group, which was behind the Pegasus software, is now more than ever’ published on 10 April 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/nso-pegasus-hack-one-year-anniversary/","summary":"Despite multiple government and parliamentary bodies examining the Pegasus hack, a whole year has passed and we still do not know who was responsible for this egregious violation of the privacy of human rights defenders in the country.","title":"Statement: One year of inaction, delay and evasion on the NSO-Pegasus hack #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  tl;dr Over the last couple of weeks, we have taken a closer look at the various surveillance technology projects that the Government is slowly putting in place. Now, we talk about why we should all be extremely worried. While this may sound alarmist, the lack of laws which would protect our privacy and from surveillance is one of the biggest causes of alarms in India’s near future.\nWhy should you care about privacy? In our previous posts in the “Watch the Watchmen” series, we have highlighted various projects that the government is developing and deploying that would enable it to strengthen the internet security structure of the country. These projects include the NATGRID, the CMS, the CCTNS and the AFRS.\nThe aim of the Government behind the introduction of these projects is to ensure that a higher level of coordination can be achieved between the intelligence agencies at the Central level and the law enforcement agencies to ensure that terror threats are neutralised swiftly and criminals can be apprehended easily.\nWhile these concerns do come across as valid, the cause for alarm surrounding these projects is much simpler. These projects are problematic simply because India does not have a data protection regime in place to ensure that the privacy of its citizens is not compromised or violated by excessive interference or surveillance by the state.\nHere, it is also important to understand that the right to privacy is essential and has been reaffirmed as a fundamental right in the landmark decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1). The right to privacy is not only relevant to those who may want to hide wrongdoing as has been the narrative but is important in various contexts, for example, to ensure that one is not discriminated against on the basis of belonging to a particular religious or social group or due to one’s political ideology.\nThe Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 was touted as the solution to all the personal data related problems currently existing in India. It calls for obtaining consent before accessing an individual\u0026rsquo;s data, penalties for any violations of the law, setting up a Data Protection Authority (DPA), and that the personal data which is collected be stored in India. However, the Bill fails to safeguard Indian citizens against state sponsored surveillance.\nThe PDP Bill, 2019 provides broad exemptions to the government by stating that consent is not required to be obtained by the State which can exempt any government department by an order.\nClause 35 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to exempt by an order, ‘any agency’ of the government from all or any provisions of the data protection law if it is in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations, public order and to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence. The only safeguard is that the written order from the Central Government must specify the reasons for such exemptions, ignoring the requirements otherwise established in Indian and international law of meeting the test of being “necessary and proportionate”. These exemptions will not just apply to data gathered by such agencies, but also with any data that is shared with such agencies by other data fiduciaries. It puts the power in the hands of the Central Government and specifically makes it the judge and adjudicator of its own cause. Clause 36 of the Bill also creates specific exemptions in certain cases, to which no safeguards will apply. Clause 37 which is supposed to empower the Central Government to exempt the processing of data of foreigners by data processors is also vaguely worded. Most intelligence agencies of India suffer from a lack of institutional oversight and there are no laws clearly defining their powers or limitations to those powers. Further, there is the lack of any serious review of telephone tapping and other communications interception powers in the Bill. This will make personal data of citizens open to mass surveillance and make the protection meaningless.\nThe Bill was first introduced in the Lok Sabha by the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, on December 11, 2019. The Lok Sabha referred the Bill to the Joint Parliamentary Committee which invited comments/suggestions from stakeholders till February, 2020. (Read IFF’s comments here) While the report of the JPC is due in the upcoming winter session of the Parliament, the Bill is likely to be tabled in the next year\u0026rsquo;s budget session.\nThe Schrems II Dilemma On July 16, 2020, the Court of European Union (‘CJEU’) passed a landmark judgement in Data Protection Commission v. Facebook Ireland, Maximillian Schrems (‘Schrems II Decision’). The Schrems II Decision produced shockwaves for the practice of commercial transnational data transfers of personal data originating from the European Union (‘EU’) and being transmitted to a non-EU country, such as India. Under the EU data protection regime, data transfers are conducted pursuant to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), in conjunction with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (‘Charter’) and several other directive and regulations. Chapter V of the GDPR allows for transfers of data outside the EU through three different modes, provided that the receiving countries were determined to provide adequate privacy protections for the same. First, an adequacy decision may be passed by the Data Protection Commission as to the existence of adequate privacy protection within the domestic legal framework of the receiving country. Second, an agreement to provide adequate safeguards, accompanied with enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects. These may take place between two public authorities, such as in the case of the EU-US Safe Harbour or Privacy Shield, or between the sending and receiving data processors, such as in the case of Standard Contract Clauses (‘SCCs’), or between affiliated companies within a single commercial enterprise, such as in the case of Binding Corporate Rules (‘BCRs’). Third, derogations, or exceptions, to the requirement of either one of the above may be availed in specific circumstances.\nThe CJEU, in the Schrems II Decision, concluded three crucial findings regarding the transnational transfer of personal data from European Union:\nA. The CJEU Confirms Extra-Territorial Application of GDPR for EU-Citizens’ Data\nFirst, it held that the GDPR would remain applicable to personal data that has been transferred out of the European Union by one economic operator, or body corporate, to another for any commercial purpose, regardless of whether such data may be processed by the governmental authorities of the latter for the purposes of public security, defence and State security.\nB. SCCs to Hold Validity Only if Underlying Framework Provides GDPR-Esque Data Protection\nSecond, it affirmed the validity of SCCs, provided that the level of data protection must be of a standard which is “essentially equivalent” to that guaranteed under the GDPR, read with the Charter. To this effect, The CJEU mandated the use of “other clauses or additional safeguards” in circumstances where the SCC itself failed to secure adequate levels of protection. These may cover, for example, the issue of law enforcement and access of personal data by government agencies. Additionally, respective Data Protection Authorities were under the obligation to suspend or prohibit data transfer to any third country wherein the aforementioned privacy safeguards, and alternative methods to achieve the same, were absent.\nC. EU-US Privacy Shield Invalidated for Lack of Safeguard Against Government-Sanctioned Surveillance\nThird, it invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield on the grounds that:\n the United State surveillance regime, based on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 178 and Executive Order 12333 (1981), assumes primacy of national interest and law enforcement over the fundamental right to privacy by allowing the the sanctioning of surveillance with no apparent limitation, violating the principles of proportionality in so far as the same is not restricted by the requirement of necessity, the United States does not provide foreign data subjects with an actionable right against the Government for privacy breaches, under the Presidential Privacy Directive 28 (2014) and Executive Order 12333 (1981), and the United States legislative framework is inadequate in ensuring the independence of the judicial ombudsman, an authority established by the EU-US Privacy Shield and an undersecretary of state, and the requisite authority of the body to deliver binging judgments upon US intelligence services.  What this means for India? According to Article 45 of the GDPR, the relevant inquiry into an adequacy decision involves an assessment of the rules and regulations applicable to data controllers and processors within a country. This also includes an analysis of the accompanying safeguards limiting the governmental access to foreign personal data. Per the Schrems II Decision, a like analysis would now be required for the operation of other modes of data transfer, such as Privacy Shields, SCCs, or BCRs. The recognition of the fundamental right to privacy in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (‘Puttaswamy Decision’) inducted principles of proportionality from Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Yet, without an underlying statutory framework, these rights lack remedial mechanisms that may be triggered by their violation. However, while the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (‘PDPB’) remains to be passed, India exists in a state of limbo. Without a current standard of foreign personal data protection for all commercial operations, India does not qualify the criteria for an adequacy decision. Additionally, as has been highlighted throughout our “Watch the Watchmen” series, the citizens of India themselves do not have any strict protections from state surveillance which vitiates the question of protecting foreign data from surveillance as well. In such a situation, India stands to be outcast by being restricted to trade and offer services within the EU.\nThe Schrems II decision analysis included in this post has been done by former IFF intern Rohit Gupta.\nImportant documents  Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link) Public Brief and Analysis of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (link) IFF’s “Watch the Watchmen” series on Surveillance Technology Projects in India (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-5-the-personal-data-protection-bill-2019/","summary":"In the fifth part of our \u0026ldquo;Watch the Watchmen\u0026rdquo; series, we take a closer look at PDP Bill which is likely to be tabled in next year\u0026rsquo;s Budget Session.","title":"Watch the Watchmen Series Part 5 : The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019"},{"content":"  tl;dr We wrote to the Government of Kerala cautioning them about the free speech risks that could arise from their proposed amendment of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. Our main recommendation was that any such amendment go through sufficient legal scrutiny and public consultation.\nThe Proposed Amendment The Government of Kerala announced on October 21, 2020 its decision to amend the Kerala Police Act, 2011. The amendment aims to prevent cyber attacks against women and children through the introduction of a new provision which would state that\n “anyone who produces content, publishes or propagates it through any means of communication with an intention to threaten, insult or harm the reputation of an individual will be punished with an imprisonment of five years or a fine of Rs 10,000 or with both”.\n We note with concern that the text of this provision has not been made available on the official websites of the Government of Kerala and neither has it been put towards any public consultation. This is deviating from the norm of transparency and pre-legislative consultation.\nIt is also a matter of concern that this amendment is being introduced through ordinance which raises serious concerns about its validity. It is our opinion that any such amendment which curbs free speech on the internet needs to undergo sufficient legal scrutiny which can be achieved only if it is discussed and debated upon by the state legislature.\nReturn of the Zombie The decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the landmark case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2013) 12 SCC 73 had previously struck down S.66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and S. 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 for being violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India under Article 19(1)(a) which guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to Indian citizens. The Shreya Singhal decision highlights the need to ensure that overbroad restrictions on online speech are not used as a tool by the State to criminalise free speech on the internet.\n “However, what has been said about Section 66A would apply directly to Section 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act, as causing annoyance in an indecent manner suffers from the same type of vagueness and over breadth, that led to the invalidity of Section 66A, and for the reasons given for striking down Section 66A, Section 118(d) also violates Article 19(1)(a) and not being a reasonable restriction on the said right and not being saved under any of the subject matters contained in Article 19(2) is hereby declared to be unconstitutional.”\n The introduction of amended provision in question is concerning because of its similarity to the unconstitutional S.66A. The provisions suffers from a similar vice of being void for vagueness. The phrases as mentioned in the press report of the proposed Section 118 (A) mentions, “insult” and, “harm” are elastic and devoid of context and precise definition. Hence, the provision is in violation of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India and puts users of the internet at risk.\nOur recommendations  Introduction of any such amendment be done with full and complete transparency and not with haste. An important element is for the State Government to seek opinion on the proposed provision for compliance with the judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court from the State Advocate General’s office. We further recommended that a public consultation process be put in place to invite stakeholder comments from interested parties such as experts on online free speech, women’s rights activists and individuals/organisations that work at the intersection of these concerns. We urged for a fuller examination for creating an administrative and social toolkit in which legal responses play a role. Here, we recommended safeguarding free speech on the internet by moving away from criminalisation of online speech except under certain circumstances as contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  We are building a Zombie Tracker! Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India in March, 2015 in Shreya Singhal v Union of India. The Court declared that the provision was void ab initio i.e was deemed to never have existed on the statute books. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A. However, in 2018, a research paper by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta highlighted that Section 66A was being still used for legal prosecutions all over the country. Taking note of the above-mentioned study, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (‘PUCL’), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal case approached the court in January, 2019 highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court’s decision. Inspite of repeated directions by the Supreme Court as late as 2019, our preliminary research shows that, S. 66A is still being invoked in fresh cases. Our preliminary findings were backed by a recent media report which highlights the continued invocation of S.66A. Further, we noticed that the mountain of pending cases including a charge under S.66A is ever increasing. Therefore, we are building a tool to track registered cases which include a charge under S.66A. We intend to use the data and insights generated from it to bolster our advocacy efforts to ensure that no fresh charge is registered under S.66A and pending charges under S.66A are dismissed.\nThe Zombie Tracker will be tracking cases which include a charge under S.66A at the district level, across 11 states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal. The tracker will be collecting case data using the E-Courts application programming interface (API) , for the period 27th October 2009 to 15th February 2020.\nImportant Documents  Representation to the Government of Kerala on the Amendment to the Kerala Police Act, 2011 dated October 24, 2020 (link) Update on IFF’s Zombie Tracker dated July 8, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/keralas-proposed-amendment-to-curb-online-abuse-is-eerie-in-its-similarity-to-the-unconstitutional-s-66a/","summary":"Read IFF\u0026rsquo;s representation to the Government of Kerala highlighting the similarities between their proposed amendment to the Kerala Police Act and the unconstitutional S.66A of the IT Act, 2000.","title":"Kerala's Proposed Amendment to curb online abuse is eerie in its similarity to the unconstitutional S.66A"},{"content":"  tl;dr IFF has submitted comments pursuant to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s Consultation Paper on Roadmap to Promote Broadband Connectivity and Enhanced Broadband Speed. In our comments, we highlighted the need to revamp the policy and regulatory initiatives surrounding the broadband infrastructure in the country to ensure that every citizen has access to the internet irrespective of their geographical location or social and economic status.\nAccess to Internet is Essential The right to access the internet has not yet been recognized as a fundamental right. However, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India it was held that the internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights provided by the Constitution of India. The judgement states that expressing one’s views or conducting one’s business through the internet are protected under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution respectively. However, does the Government have a positive obligation to provide access to the internet?\nThe National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP), 2018 seeks to unlock the transformative power of digital communications networks - to achieve the goal of digital empowerment and improved well-being of the people of India. To this end the NDCP attempts to outline a set of goals, initiatives, strategies and intended policy outcomes. This policy has three missions, the first of which is “Connect India: Creating Robust Digital Communications Infrastructure”. The aim of this mission is to promote Broadband for All as a tool for socio-economic development, while ensuring service quality and environmental sustainability.\nTo achieve this, we need to ensure that broadband infrastructure caters not only to needs based on connectivity and geography but also serves to alleviate sections of the society who have traditionally not been able to enjoy the benefits of access to the internet. Focused efforts need to be made by the Authority to ensure that special measures are taken to account for social conditions which have acted as a deterrent to access such as gender, caste or economic status.\nOur submissions The paper touches upon various issues pertaining to broadband access and connectivity. Below we have summarized two of our main submissions.\n1. Need for updation of current definition In our submissions, we highlight the lacuna that exists in the current framing of the definition of the term “broadband” and suggest necessary changes to ensure that it covers all of “Bharat”. Revision of the current definition is needed acutely and moving forward a process of constant revision should be put in place to ensure that the definition keeps pace with developments across the world.\nPresently, the definition of broadband talks only about download speed which leaves much to be desired in terms of setting adequate standards which would help India achieve the goals of the NDCP-2018. India has a large digital economy which relies on synchronous digital communication. Upload speeds are vital to economic growth, cultural production and IOT devices. We have noticed that ISPs restrict and throttle upload speeds which impedes innovation and growth. To account for a fuller, complete advancement of the rights of users our recommendations is for broadband speeds to be a definition inclusive of upload speeds as well. Additionally, the definition should include download as well as upload speed to correspond to the dynamic use of the internet in the present scenario wherein the internet is used not only to consume information (download) but also to connect with peers and share information (upload).\nTherefore, we suggested that “broadband” can be defined as: “Broadband is a data connection that is able to support interactive services including Internet access and has the capability of providing download and upload speeds which fall into one of the four categories mentioned herein to an individual subscriber from the point of presence (POP) of the service provider intending to provide Broadband service. The four categories of broadband speed are:\n Normal - 512 KBp/s to 2 MBp/s download speed , 256 KBp/s to 1 MBp/s upload speed Good - 2 MBp/s to 20 MBp/s download speed , 1 MBp/s to 10 MBp/s upload speed Fast - 20 MBp/s to 50 MBp/s download speed , 10 MBp/s to 25 MBp/s upload speed Superfast - 50 MBp/s download speed and above, 25 MBp/s upload speed and above.  2. Need for development of broadband infrastructure We also highlight the need to ensure that not only policy but also the accompanying infrastructure is developed in a way that constant updation is made possible. The Authority needs to envisage a way in which the development of infrastructure is done keeping in mind a public and private sector partnership. Therefore, we submitted that the government adopts the “Dig Smart” approach for broadband infrastructure creation and highlight the multiple possibilities for cross-sector infrastructure development and sharing.\nThe “Dig Smart” approach has been developed by the Fiber To The Home (FTTH) Council in the United States of America in their paper titled ‘FTTH Council Dig Smart: Best Practices for Cities and States Adopting Dig Once Policies’. The Dig Smart policy entails the “governments installing conduit whenever there is underground construction in the public right of way \u0026ndash; whether that construction is for installing new utility equipment, repairs, or road work. The government then has the opportunity to lease that conduit to broadband providers that are interested in deploying fiber networks to the community. This approach benefits the community by facilitating broadband entry and by giving the government an ongoing revenue source. In fact, as (they) will show, these revenues can more than make up for the initial capital expense. While some governments may be hesitant to pay for conduit themselves because of its short-term budget impact, they can recoup that investment over time while also creating significant benefits from the community.”\nThese comments were drafted by IFF staff with the help of software engineer Gargi Sharma.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s comments on TRAI\u0026rsquo;s Consultation Paper on Roadmap to Promote Broadband Connectivity and Enhanced Broadband Speed dated October 19, 2020 (link) TRAI’s Consultation Paper on Roadmap to Promote Broadband Connectivity and Enhanced Broadband Speed dated August 20, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/read-iffs-comments-on-trais-consultation-paper-on-broadband-access-and-connectivity/","summary":"In our comments, we highlighted the need to revamp the policy and regulatory initiatives surrounding the broadband infrastructure in the country to ensure that every citizen has access to the internet irrespective of their geographical location or social and economic status.","title":"Read IFF's Comments on TRAI's Consultation Paper on Broadband Access and Connectivity"},{"content":"  Tl;dr The latest Aadhaar Good Governance Rules notified in August 2020 legitimize function creep of the Aadhaar programme by allowing Aadhaar authentication for usage of digital platforms to ensure good governance, prevention of dissipation of social welfare benefits, and enablement of innovation and the spread of knowledge. These Rules come on the heels of amendements to the Aadhaar Act in 2019 which authorized use of Aadhaar by private parties, and these amendments have been challenged before the Supreme Court for violating the judgement in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J. The cummulative impact of the Aadhaar Amendment Act 2019 and the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules 2020 is that there remain virtually no limitations on the use of Aadhaar authentication, which had earlier been restricted by the Supreme Court to only government entities and only for receipt of benefits and subsidies funded by the Consolidated Fund of India.\nBackground The Aadhaar project, which is a biometrics based national unique ID programme, was challenged before the Supreme Court of India in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India in 2012 for violating individual privacy and causing exclusion. The subsequent litigation led to the question of whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution being referred to a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court. In K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Privacy 9J (2017 10 SCC 1), this nine judge bench unanimously held the privacy is a fundamental right and any restrictions upon this right must satisfy the proportionality standard.\nThe constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016 was specifically addressed by a five judge bench of the Supreme Court in its subsequent judgement in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J (2019 1 SCC 1), where the majority of judges upheld the constitutionality of the Act subject to certain limitations. Most importantly, __ the Supreme Court held that under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, an Aadhaar number cannot be mandated unless it involves seeking any subsidy, benefit or service for which the expenditure is incurred by the Consolidated Fund of India. The Court also struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act to the extent it allowed use of Aadhaar authentication by private parties since it would lead to commercial exploitation of biometric and demographic information.\nDespite the Supreme Court finding that use of Aadhaar authentication by private parties is a dispropotionate invasion of privacy, the government soon proposed amendments to the Aadhaar Act which would allow private parties to continue using Aadhaar to establish the identity of their users. Through the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Act 2019, private entities were allowed to perform authentication through Aadhaar, if the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is satisfied that it is: (i) compliant with certain standards of privacy and security, or (ii) permitted by law, or (iii) seeking authentication for a purpose specified by the central government in the interest of the State. The constitutionality of these amendments has been challenged before the Supreme Court. Legal experts have also explained that Aadhaar authentication by private parties is inconsistent with the judgement in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J since \u0026ldquo;the majority upholds the Aadhaar Act on the premise that authentication is proportional only when used for state purposes to deliver services socio-economic benefits that are linked to human dignity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;this analogy does not extend to private/commercial interests.\u0026quot;\nThe Aadhaar Good Governance Rules, 2020 The Aadhaar Authentication for Good Governance (Social Welfare, Innovation, Knowledge) Rules, 2020 were notified by the central government in August 2020. The Rules allow Aadhaar authentication by “requesting entities” in the “interest of good governance, preventing leakage of public funds, promoting ease of living of residents and enabling better access to services for them” for the enlisted purposes of:(a) usage of digital platforms to ensure good governance;(b) prevention of dissipation of social welfare benefits; and(c) enablement of innovation and the spread of knowledge.\nAs per the rules, the authentication of Aadhaar by these requesting entities shall be on a voluntary basis but past experience raises serious concerns about Aadhaar being voluntary only on paper, and not in practice. Under the Rules, the relevant ministry or the department of the central government or the state government is required to prepare a proposal with a justification for the purpose for which it is seeking Aadhaar authentication. This proposal submitted to the Central Government will then be referred to UIDAI, and if UIDAI is satisfied that the proposal fulfills the enlisted purposes, the requesting entity shall be allowed to ask for Aadhaar authentication.\nThe application form and the guidelines for submission of a proposal under the Rules mandate that the proposal should contain a “brief description of the initiative or scheme highlighting the benefit that would accrue from its implementation”. It further states that such benefits should be relatable to the specified purposes, for example, “by facilitating participation, accountability, transparency, responsiveness, efficiency, effectiveness, equity, inclusion etc. which reduce or eliminate transaction costs, or promote ease of living of residents or enable better access to services for them.” It also requires that the justification of the purpose should be brought out clearly, and the proposal should explain the “ecosystem and the processes involved in the achievement or delivery of the benefit.”\nA Free for All Privacy Nightmare The purposes for requesting Aadhaar authentication under the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules, 2020 are extremely vague and broad, and any government service can potentially fall within their scope. There are no parameters laid down for the UIDAI to determine whether Aadhaar authentication is \u0026lsquo;necessary,\u0026rsquo; especially since the purposes themselves are so ambiguously wide and pale in comparison to the seriousness of the fundamental right to privacy. Therefore, in the absence of strict guidelines, all and sundry purposes can be sought to be justified. For example, the first chairman of the UIDAI has already expressed his views on the benefits of Aadhaar authentication for distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.\nAllowing such authentication runs the risk of being directly in the teeth of the Supreme Court judgment in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India- Aadhaar 5J wherein it was categorically held that Aadhaar enrolment can be mandated only for receipt of \u0026ldquo;any subsidy, benefit or service under the welfare scheme of the government expenditure whereof is to be met from the Consolidated Fund of India.\u0026quot; It should also be noted that when read together with the amendments to the Aadhaar Act in 2019, the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules 2020 create a risk of use of Aadhaar authentication by private parties for wide ranging purposes since Section 4(4) of the Aadhaar Act now allows any \u0026ldquo;requesting entity\u0026rdquo; to seek permission for Aadhaar authentication from UIDAI. Rule 3 of the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules requires proposals for Aadhaar authentication by requesting entities to be submitted by the government ministries or departments but there is no pre-condition that the requesting entity on whose behalf Aadhaar authentication is being sought should also be a government entity.\nThe dependence on Aadhaar authentication to prevent dissipation of benefits has led to the exclusion of many people who are the rightful beneficiaries of these entitlements, and such exclusion is counterproductive if the goal is improving access to government services. A study conducted by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab in Jharkhand found that at least 88% of the ration cards that were cancelled, were in fact genuine claims. There have also been several instances of people facing practical difficulties in getting Aadhaar numbers and accessing welfare schemes because of lack of awareness, lack of infrastructure, immobility due to illness etc.\nFrom the very inception of Aadhaar, the government has claimed that its biometric authentication technology helps prevent identity fraud and ensures that benefits only go to the deserving. However, as economists have pointed out, there is no reliable evidence backing claims of widespread identity fraud and Aadhaar\u0026rsquo;s ability to plug these leakages. Further, an RTI query revealed that 99.97 percent of people who enrolled for an Aadhaar number did it on the basis of existing identification documents, so lack of identification documents is clearly not the main cause of exclusion from welfare programmes.\nTo conclude, as Rethink Aadhaar has incisively noted in this excellent post, the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules 2020 are just old wine in a new bottle. The purpose of subordinate legislation is to be more operationally specific, by clarifying ambiguities. However, the Rules come across as an attempt to sidestep the Supreme Court judgement in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India Aadhaar-5J by expanding the scope of the Aadhaar project through the trappings of vague rules and guidelines.\nImportant Documents  Aadhaar Good Governance Rules, 2020 (link) Aadhaar Amendment Act, 2019 (link) Aadhaar Act, 2016 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/aadhaar-good-governance-rules/","summary":"After the Aadhaar Amendment Act 2019 and the Aadhaar Good Governance Rules 2020, there remain virtually no limitations on the use of Aadhaar authentication, which had earlier been restricted by the SC to only government entities and only for receipt of benefits and subsidies.","title":"While India copes with COVID-19, Aadhaar continues its function creep #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  tl;dr The National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) is being developed by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The project aims to develop and use a national database of photographs which is to be used in conjunction with a facial recognition technology system by Central and State security agencies.\nHistory The NCRB first released the Request for Proposals (RFP) (Document Reference: 02/001).calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject here). However, the deadline was extended multiple times due to reported administrative reasons. Finally, the RFP was recalled and cancelled. A new revised version of the RFP [Document Reference: 02/001 (Revised)] was issued on June 22, 2020.\nThe current deadline for the submission of bids is October 8, 2020.\nThe estimated budget of the project is INR 308 crore.\nWhat is AFRS? The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:\n Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs, Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA , Women and Child Development Ministry\u0026rsquo;s KhoyaPaya Portal, Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA Any other image database available with police/other entities.  To identify criminals, scene of crime (SOC) images and videos will be matched with the abovementioned databases by using facial recognition technology. Face recognition systems use computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face. These details, such as distance between the eyes or shape of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database. The data about a particular face is often called a face template and is distinct from a photograph because it’s designed to only include certain details that can be used to distinguish one face from another.\nWhat could go wrong? Identification happens when FRT is used to identify an individual from a pool of many people. This kind of 1: many FRT based identification is typically used for security and surveillance purposes. Verification, on the other hand, occurs when an image is compared to another image from an existing database in order to verify that the individual is who he/she claims to be, i.e., authentication of identity on a 1:1 basis.\nImplementation of a Faulty FRT System Claims relating to accuracy of FRT systems are routinely exaggerated and the real numbers leave much to be desired. The implementation of such faulty FRT systems would lead to high rates of false positives and false negatives in this recognition process.\n A false positive occurs when FRT gives an incorrect positive result wherein the system misidentifies an individual as someone he/she is not. This may lead to discrimination and strengthening of existing biases. For instance, ACLU found that Amazon’s facial recognition software “Rekognition” incorrectly matched 28 members of the US Congress with people who had been arrested for committing a crime. Of those members who were incorrectly matched, 40% were people of color which is a disproportionate number since people of color make up only 20% of the US Congress. A false negative occurs when the FRT gives an incorrect negative result wherein the system is unable to recognize an individual or authenticate his/her identity. This may lead to arbitrary exclusion of an individual from government schemes and benefits. Failure of biometric based authentication under Aadhaar has led to many people being excluded from receiving essential government services and even led to starvation deaths. Such problems will be further aggravated by an inaccurate FRT system.  The AFRS is being developed and deployed by the government without any technical standards in place which may lead to faulty systems being implemented. Once in place, it would be very difficult for it to be reconciled with future technical standards and damage like discrimination and exclusion would be impossible to undo. In the revised RFP, there is no mention of the international standards which were included in the original RFP which had to be complied with as a technical requirement. The reason behind the exclusion of these standards is unclear and raises the question of why necessary standards of technical requirements are being diluted.\nImplementation of an Accurate FRT System While there have been claims of a fully accurate FRT system, none of these claims have been corroborated by independent review and audit. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has extensively tested FRT systems for 1:1 verification and 1:many identification and how accuracy of these systems vary across demographic groups. These independent studies have concluded that currently, no FRT system has 100% accuracy.\nAn accurate FRT system would hypothetically have a 100% success rate in 1:1 verification and/or 1:many identification. However, it will come with its own ominous connotations, the most problematic of which may be state led mass surveillance and difficulty for outside actors to counter-challenge government decisions.\nProbe images for FRT systems are often collected by the police through CCTV cameras installed in public spaces. Individuals in a CCTV surveilled area may be aware that they are under surveillance but the assumption is that this surveillance is temporary. Use of CCTV in conjunction with FRT would mean their images will be stored for a longer period of time, if not permanently. This data will also be used to extract particular data points such as the facial features and other biometrics which the individual has not consented to sharing when entering a CCTV surveilled zone and these data points can be used to track future movements of the person. Therefore, integration of FRT with a network of CCTV cameras would make real time surveillance extremely easy.\nOne of the most important changes which have been made in the revised RFP is that it now states that the project “does not involve the installation of CCTV camera nor will it connect to any existing CCTV camera anywhere”. This is a departure from the original RFP wherein CCTV integration had been included as a functional requirement.\nHowever in the revised RFP, a new data source \u0026ldquo;Scene of Crime images/videos\u0026rdquo; has been introduced for input into the AFRS database. This inclusion is at odds with the previous assertion made in the RFP - that integration of CCTVs will not take place. Deletion of CCTV camera footage as a data source leaves a gap in the functional architecture of AFRS and the RFP fails to satisfactorily account for its replacement. The RFP also fails to mention how the data and subsequent analysis/ information which is obtained through AFRS will be presented and utilized in a court of law, i.e., the nature of the evidence obtained from AFRS and its admissibility as pertaining to its reliability in courts.\nDeployment of AFRS without adequate legal safeguards is deeply troubling. Specific laws with regard to FRT and personal data protection do not currently exist in India. While a flawed Personal Data Protection Bill has been introduced in the Parliament (read more here), there is uncertainty about when it will be enacted and implemented and how effective it will be in protecting the personal data of individuals. Under the current version of the Bill, wide exceptions have been provided to the Government for surveillance related activities. A strong data protection legislation is needed to hold these FRT systems accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties.\nThe implementation of an accurate FRT system would also violate fundamental rights by facilitating mass surveillance. For instance, there will be a chilling effect on the right to freedom of speech and expression because people will be wary of being prosecuted in case they express anti-government sentiments. Further, the right to freedom of movement would be hampered as mass surveillance would allow the government to track the movements of individuals in real time across the country. Finally, the right to privacy will be violated as sensitive personal data which is collected by these FRT systems will be used by the Government without the informed consent of the individual. This would also hamper the individual from exercising the liberty to share their information in some contexts and remain anonymous in others according to their individual choice.\nAs per the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1) any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution must conform to certain thresholds. These thresholds are:\nA. Legality Where the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. As pointed out in our previous legal notice as well, there is no anchoring legislation which allows for and regulates the use of AFRS. In the absence of such a framework and safeguards, the first requirement for lawful restriction on the right to privacy is not met.\nB. Necessity Which justifies that the restriction to people’s privacy (in this case data collection and sharing) is needed in a democratic society to fulfill a legitimate state aim. In the RFP, it is stated that the need for AFRS arises because it will enable automatic identification and verification through criminal databases which would help investigation of crime and tracking and detection of criminals.\nThis characterisation is based on a faulty assumption that facial recognition technology is accurate and would provide speedy and correct results. However, ongoing research in the field has shown that facial recognition technology which is completely accurate has not been developed yet. Use of such inaccurate technology, especially for criminal prosecution, could thus result in a false positive, i.e., misidentification of an innocent individual as a suspect in a crime. Thus, AFRS fails to meet the requirement of necessity as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Puttaswamy judgment.\nC. Proportionality Where the Government must show among other things that the measure being undertaken has a rational nexus with the objective. The AFRS contemplates collecting sensitive personal information, intimate information of all individuals in the absence of any reasonable suspicion by collecting images and videos from a scene of crime. This could cast a presumption of criminality on a broad set of people. In the Supreme Court’s decision in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1 or the Aadhaar judgment , the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that:\n “[u]nder the garb of prevention of money laundering or black money, there cannot be such a sweeping provision which targets every resident of the country as a suspicious person”\n While this statement was made in the context of rejecting the mandatory linkage of Aadhaar with bank accounts to counter money laundering, it clearly shows that imposition of such a restriction on the entire population, without any evidence of wrongdoing on their part, would constitute a disproportionate response. Similarly, collecting sensitive personal information of all individuals who were present at the scene of crime creates a presumption of criminality which is disproportionate to the objective it aims to achieve.\nD. Procedural safeguards Where there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. At present, there is no independent institutional mechanism which would put in place procedural safeguards in the RFP which will regulate the proposed project. In the absence of any checks and balances, function creep becomes an immediate problem wherein the issue of AFRS being used for functions more than its stated purpose becomes a reality. Use of AFRS without safeguards could result in illegal state-sponsored mass surveillance which would have a chilling effect on fundamental rights such right to freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of association which are guaranteed in the Constitution. Fear of identification and retaliation by the state would deter individuals from exercising their fundamental right to protest which is included in the freedom of speech and expression.\nProject Panoptic IFF has been tracking the RFP for AFRS since last year and has sent two legal notices to the NCRB pertaining to its illegality (Read here and here). Additionally, under our Project Panoptic, we have also been tracking all other instances of facial recognition use in the country that we have come across. Our main aim behind this project is to increase transparency and accountability from the authorities who are implementing these projects.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s Legal Notice to the NCRB on the Revised RFP for the National Automated Facial Recognition System dated July 15, 2020 (link) We might be in the market for a new kind of face mask dated July 18, 2019 (link) We wrote to NCRB and MHA requesting them to halt their ongoing National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) project dated April 22, 2020 (link) Problems with Facial Recognition Technology Operating in a Legal Vacuum dated February 20, 2020 (link) Update on IFF\u0026rsquo;s #ProjectPanoptic dated July 21, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-4-the-national-automated-facial-recognition-system/","summary":"In the fourth part of our \u0026ldquo;Watch the Watchmen\u0026rdquo; series which aims to develop and use a national database of photographs which is to be used in conjunction with a facial recognition technology system by Central and State security agencies to swiftly identify criminals.","title":"Watch the Watchmen Series Part 4 : The National Automated Facial Recognition System"},{"content":"  tl;dr Read our comments to the AI Standardisation Committee constituted by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on their paper for the Development of an Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack released on September 2, 2020. Our main recommendation to the committee was to set up an independent supervisory data protection authority to regulate the stack.\nThe Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack On September 2, 2020, the AI Standardisation Committee constituted by the DoT released the paper for the Development of an Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack. The paper states that the Government of India has recognised that an AI driven economy, can transform the lives of millions, i.e., AI is the main driver for the desired socio- economic transformation of India. This paper proposes a stack that seeks to remove the impediments to AI deployment by putting in place a comprehensive framework. This will enable development of a suitable AI stack with a different mix of layers and interfaces that complement each other and achieve integration. This paper proposes to divide the AI stack in six different layers with appropriate horizontal and vertical integration. These six layers are:\n Infrastructure Layer Storage Layer Compute Layer Application Layer Data / Information Layer Security \u0026amp; Governance Layer  Our comments After analysing the paper at length, we came to the conclusion that while the paper highlights certain problems which are generally associated with AI, it fails to provide nuance to these concerns specifically how these concerns will be resolved. Additionally, we also realized that the paper had failed to address one of the most pressing concerns related to AI, i.e, mass surveillance. Thus, we divided our comments into two parts:\n1. Absence of Nuance We noticed that while the paper does point out several concerns with AI, it fails to satisfactorily address these concerns. These concerns mainly relate to:\nPrivacy/Security of data collected The data being collected by the AI Stack covers a wide range of categories which include sensitive personal data. Paragraph 5.29 of the paper states that “The data processed and stored in many cases include geolocation information, product-identifying data, and personal information related to use or owner identity, such as biometric data, health information, or smart-home metrics. For some applications personal information are also captured through audio or video, or include communication capabilities, such as those used in children’s devices.” The collection of such sensitive personal data raises the obvious question of how will the privacy and data protection issues be resolved.\nParagraph 5.3 of the paper states that “In the absence of a clear data protection law in the country, EU\u0026rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or any of the laws can be applied. This will serve as interim measure until Indian laws are formalised.”. The Personal Data Protection Bill is currently languishing in the Parliament and it is not known when it will be formalised. However, while the paper does provide for alternatives, it also creates confusion and vagueness as to their applicability. The term “or any of the laws” is unclear and does not indicate which specific laws the paper is pointing to.\nThus, the paper puts forward the EU\u0026rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as the data protection law which will be applied to the AI Stack. However, the paper fails to address how it will comply with the extensive provisions of the GDPR. One of the requirements under the GDPR is the establishment of a supervisory authority under recital 117 of the GDPR. It is the responsibility of the supervisory authority under recital 122 of the GDPR to ensure that the processing of personal data carried out by public authorities or private bodies acting in the public interest is done in compliance with the principles laid down in GDPR. However, India does not have any such supervisory authority nor does the paper provide for the setting up of one. In the absence of a supervisory authority, enforcement of the GDPR for the AI Stack is not possible.\nIn addition to this, certain features of the AI Stack mentioned in the paper are clearly violative of the GDPR. These include paragraph 2.6, which mentions the use of social media data to generate credit scores thereby violating the the conditions of consent laid down in the GDPR under article 7 and paragraph 5.20, which arbitrarily divides the collected data into three categories (hot data, warm data and cold data) thereby violating the purpose limitation principle as stated in Article 5 of the GDPR.\nAlgorithmic Bias Another concern that the paper raises but fails to provide adequate nuance to is how the AI Stack will ensure against algorithmic bias. The paper, in paragraph 4.10, rightly points out that algorithmic bias occurs because “The self learning nature of AI means, the distorted data the AI discovers in search engines, perhaps based upon “unconscious and institutional biases”, and other prejudices, is codified into a matrix that will make decisions for years to come.” As a solution the paper suggests “a need for evolving ethical standards, trustworthiness, and consent framework to get data validation from users.” However, these provisions do not find any mention in the actual proposed stack itself. The paper fails to address how the data/information exchange layer \u0026amp; compute layer will address algorithmic bias and how these layers will ensure that ethical standards are followed in the collection of data and in the building of the algorithm itself. Standards of data collection are also important to ensure that the data collected is sufficiently representative of the population it purports to represent.\nFor instance, paragraph 2.5 (a) mentions that access to healthcare can be increased in rural areas with the help of AI and makes the following argument: “This can be achieved through implementation of AI driven diagnostics, personalised treatment, early identification of potential pandemics, and imaging diagnostics, among others.” However, what also needs to be taken into account here is that there exists a massive problem of gender bias not only in medical research, but also in access to medical help. The paper also needs to address and expand on such issues to ensure that existing biases in both medical research and medical access do not creep into the proposed solutions being developed under the AI Stack. To ensure against such occurrences, the AI Now Institute based in New York has released a study titled “Algorithmic Impact Assessments: A Practical Framework For Public Agency Accountability” which introduces a model framework for governmental entities to use to create algorithmic impact assessments (AIAs), which evaluate the potential detrimental effects of an algorithm in the same manner as environmental, privacy, data, or human rights impact statements. Such a safeguard, however, is lacking in the proposed AI Stack.\n2. Need for the AI Stack to address state surveillance concerns One of the major gaps in the paper is its failure to address the concerns surrounding use of AI for state-sponsored mass surveillance. According to a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace working paper titled, “The Global Expansion of AI Surveillance” authored by Steven Feldstein, AI surveillance technology is spreading at a faster rate to a wider range of countries than experts have commonly understood. At least seventy-five out of 176 countries globally are actively using AI technologies for surveillance purposes. Liberal democracies (such as India) are major users of AI surveillance. The index shows that 51 percent of advanced democracies deploy AI surveillance systems. In contrast, 37 percent of closed autocratic states, 41 percent of electoral autocratic/competitive autocratic states, and 41 percent of electoral democracies/illiberal democracies deploy AI surveillance technology. Governments in full democracies are deploying a range of surveillance technology, from safe city platforms to facial recognition cameras.\nAs has been reported since December 2019, use of facial recognition and drones for surveillance has been rampant in the country and especially in New Delhi. The National Crime Records Bureau’s National Automated Facial Recognition System, which is a central level project aiming to create a national database of photographs which will use facial recognition to identify suspects, is also in the Request for Proposals (RFP) stage. In addition to this, there are multiple other central and state level projects already in place or in development which aim to use AI for security or surveillance purposes. Use of AI for such projects, in the absence of a data protection regime or a concrete surveillance law regime in place raises concerns about misuse. Use of AI for surveillance makes the entire process highly streamlined and cost-effective. According to Edward Snowden, this allows for the surveillance of teams of people and even populations of people—entire movements, across borders, across languages, across cultures, in other words, state-sponsored mass surveillance.\nIn this context, it is pertinent for the AI Stack to also address how such use by the government for surveillance will be regulated by the AI Stack.\nOur recommendations Keeping in mind the above concerns, we made the following recommendations:\n An independent supervisory data protection authority consisting of relevant stakeholders should be set-up to regulate the AI Stack. We note that such an authority is presently under contemplation under the Draft Data Protection Bill and should be a condition precedent to the launch and operation of the AI Stack. The Data Protection Authority should lay down a privacy framework to ensure the right to privacy of citizens is not violated. The privacy framework should also address how the AI Stack will address the concerns relating to state-sponsored mass surveillance. This can also be a useful body for the harmonisation of standards given the plethora of personal data policies being considered at present by the Union and State Governments. The Data Protection Authority should also work on expanding how it will ensure against algorithmic bias. For this, the authority should develop an ethical framework for data collection and storage. Some of such provisions are existing within the civil society model titled the Indian Privacy Code, 2020 which has also been introduced in parliament as a private members bill. The specific provision on the need for safeguards when automated decision making leads to legal impacts may be considered.  These comments were drafted by IFF staff with the help of software engineer Gargi Sharma.\nImportant Documents  Comments to AI Standardisation Committee, Department Of Telecommunications on the paper for Development of an Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack dated October 2, 2020 (link) Paper for Development of an Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack dated September 2, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/read-our-comments-on-the-dots-paper-to-develop-an-indian-artificial-intelligence-stack-2/","summary":"Our main recommendation to the committee was to set up an independent supervisory data protection authority to regulate the stack.","title":"Read our comments on the DoT's Paper to develop an Indian Artificial Intelligence Stack"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Last week, we wrote to the Committee for Reforms in Criminal Law established by the Ministry of Home Affairs to recommend changes to India\u0026rsquo;s entire criminal justice system. Our submission reiterates demands by lawyers, former judges, academics and civil society groups to disband the Committee whose composition and consultation process has excluded the vast majority of Indian society. While the primary demand is reconstitution of the Committee and postponement of the consultation process till the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we have also highlighted various issues relating to substantive, procedural and evidentiary criminal law which have an impact on the digital rights of ordinary internet users.\nBackground The Committee for Reforms in Criminal Law has been established by the Ministry of Home Affairs to recommend changes to India\u0026rsquo;s criminal justice system within six months while most of the country is still struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The composition of the Committee lacks regional diversity and representation of women, dalits, adivasis, religious minorities and LGBTQIA+ persons. Further, the mode of consultation is also highly exclusionary since the Committee’s questionnaires and notifications are only published in English and the public can participate in the consultation only through the Committee’s website.\nFor these reasons, we fully support the call to #DisbandTheCommittee and urge you to visit this informative website which explains the problems with the Committee and helps you take action by sending emails to the Ministry of Home Affairs and your Member of Parliament. The Committee\u0026rsquo;s consultation is scheduled to end soon and we only have 10 more days to raise our voice against this process. For this reason, despite having serious reservations about the Committee, we have also provided substantive inputs on issues which lie at the intersection of digital rights and criminal law such as prosecution of internet users for social media posts and law enforcement access to mobile phones and laptops.\nImpact of Criminal Law on Digital Rights We have highlighted various issues relating to substantive, procedural and evidentiary criminal law which have an impact on the digital rights which are listed below. You can check out the PDF copy of the actual submission linked at the bottom of this post if you would like to read about any of these issues in greater detail.\n Substantive criminal law (Indian Penal Code): Sedition, hate speech, criminal defamation, obscenity and fake news. Procedural criminal law (Code of Criminal Procedure): Law enforcement access to personal electronic devices, use of Section 144 to impose internet shutdowns and app bans, and procedural aspects of criminal defamation. Evidentiary Criminal Law (Indian Evidence Act): Electronic evidence and illegally obtained evidence.  In our previous update, we had explained how vague and overbroad speech based offences under the IPC and IT Act can lead to arbitrary prosecution of internet users. In this post, we will focus on our submissions regarding law enforcement access to personal electronic devices and use of Section 144 to impose internet shutdowns and app bans, which are two core issues that IFF has been working on for a long time.\nLaw Enforcement Access to Personal Electronic Devices At the outset, we must note that unlike many other modern democracies, the Indian criminal justice system provides minimal mandatory judicial oversight in the search and seizure process, which heightens the risk of coercion and privacy violations. A combined reading of Sections 51, 102 and 165 of the CrPC indicates that police officers can search and seize personal electronic devices without prior judicial authorization. In case of warrantless searches under Section 165, CrPC, the police officer must record reasons in writing but even if this requirement is flouted, the evidence collected through the illegal search is not considered inadmissible before a court of law. Therefore, to protect the privacy of digital device users, we must first address these overarching problems in the Indian criminal justice system which permit warrantless searches and seizures and deem illegally obtained evidence as admissible.\nIn jurisdictions like the US where prior judicial authorization is generally required for search and seizure, courts have enforced this requirement in the context of personal electronic devices and even offered heightened protection in such cases. For instance, in Riley v. California, the US Supreme Court rejected the government’s claim that a warrantless search of the accused’s cell phone conducted incidental to his arrest was valid. In arriving at its conclusion, the Court relied on the heightened privacy interest associated with cell phones which store a large amount of multiple types of data going back several years. As the Court incisively noted, \u0026ldquo;a decade ago officers might have occasionally stumbled across a highly personal item such as a diary, but today many of the more than 90% of American adults who own cell phones keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives.”\nThere are two key issues which must be addressed to create a legal framework for search and seizure of personal electronic devices which balances law enforcement interests against civil liberties of citizens.\nFirst, the CrPC must provide robust judicial oversight in the search and seizure process and it should clearly and narrowly define the circumstances in which law enforcement officials can conduct warrantless searches and seizures. Most jurisdictions recognize exigent circumstances which permit warrantless search and seizure but the wide phrasing of Sections 51, 91, 102 and 165, CrPC and weak enforcement of even the meagre safeguards available make such practices the norm rather than the exception.\nSecond, in the event that the police are unable to search an accused’s phone without a password, compelled disclosure of the password should not be permitted as it would violate the guarantee against self-incrimination. Further, alphanumeric and biometric passwords should be treated alike since they are functional equivalents. It is important to note that such a prohibition against compelled disclosure of passwords would not necessarily frustrate the police’s investigation since it is possible to procure a suspect’s call records, messages, emails etc. from internet companies and telecom service providers. Ideally, judicial authorization should be required if the data is being sourced from internet companies or telecom service providers to ensure that only data relevant for the purposes of the investigation is being sought.\nUse of Section 144 to impose internet shutdowns and app bans Prior to 2017, internet shutdowns were routinely imposed under Section 144, CrPC by district authorities. However, as the Supreme Court has noted in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the legal position changed in 2017 with the notification of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 which require the Home Secretary of the Central or State Government to authorize an internet shutdown and mandate review by a review committee. Since 2017, despite the existence of a special legal framework for internet shutdowns, district officials have continued imposing internet shutdowns under Section 144, CrPC. For instance, as we had highlighted in a previous update, internet shutdowns were imposed in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal in 2020 by District Magistrates who are not empowered to exercise powers under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017.\nSection 144, CrPC has also been used by police authorities in Gujarat to ban PUBG and led to the arrest of several youngsters for merely playing a video game. The arrest of youngsters for playing PUBG was challenged before the Gujarat High Court by IFF for being an unconstitutional violation of personal liberty. It should be noted that similar to internet shutdowns, blocking of websites and mobile apps also has a separate legal framework present under Section 69A of the IT Act and IT Blocking Rules 2009. However, despite the existence of specific provisions for internet shutdowns and website blocking, district officials and police authorities have continued to rely on the general power available under Section 144, CrPC which lacks procedural safeguards and enables the arrest and prosecution of anyone who breaches the order.\nTo address this continued misuse of Section 144, CrPC which undermines the rights of internet users, it is necessary to clearly state in either the text of the provision or the accompanying form that Section 144 cannot be used to subvert the procedure prescribed under special legislations, and more specifically, it cannot be used to impose internet shutdowns or to block websites and mobile apps. In addition to this, it must be clarified that Section 144 cannot be used to impose positive obligations on individuals, such as the Noida Police Commissioner’s order mandating all residents to download the Aarogya Setu app which we had legally challenged.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s submission to the Committee for Reforms in Criminal Law (link) Explainer on law enforcement access to personal electronic devices (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/criminal-law-reform-committee-submission/","summary":"Our submission reiterates demands to disband the Committee and we have also provided substantive inputs on various issues at the intersection of criminal law and digital rights.","title":"We write to the Criminal Law Reform Committee which could make it even easier for TV anchors to read your texts #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  TLDR : The OTT Consultation Labyrinth We have charted the five year history of the consultation process on the issue of licensing of Over-The-Top (OTT) services. It has been a winding and twisting journey.\nThis was one of the legacy issues of the historic SaveTheInternet.in movement which had two clear objectives. The first was to protect net neutrality through regulation, the second was to avoid any licensing of internet services and applications that could impact user choices.\nWe are almost at the end and the outcome to this process has been fairly positive. The telecom regulator, TRAI issued recommendations on September 14, 2020 accepting most demands by digital rights organisations on behalf of everyday internet users like you (also a snub to large telecom companies, ha!). These still need to be accepted by the Department of Telecom (DOT) for the final stamp of approval. On this we have written to the DOT indicating what elements of the present recommendations require clear approval.\nLet’s take it from the beginning On November 11, 2018 the TRAI released the consultation paper on Over-The-Top (OTT) Services. A consultation paper is the usual method how it provides a background and draws in comments from the public prior to forming a policy position.\nOTT licensing is particularly scary. It ran the risk of licensing of online services, revenue sharing by website owners with telecom operators and even breaking encryption. OTT essentially expands to over-the-top, and here you may ask, well what does this mean? Over-the-top essentially reflected a telecom understanding of internet services \u0026ndash; which may be content streaming services, social media or food ordering, even map and messaging services that use the internet. As per several telecom operators these needed to be licensed so their profitability could be maintained. Questionable, right?\nSo, break down this issue into a more comprehensible and clear manner we consistently worked through 2019 and 2020 to unpack it. We first simplified the OTT consultation paper with a summary, an initial analysis, and even did number crunching to look at the broad economic trends in the telecom sector. This was to encourage more people to participate in an informed and evidence lead manner. We have followed this approach of encouraging public participation in further public consultations in which we now seek views on the Internet Freedom Forum.\nSubsequent to this we submitted comments to this public consultation being organised by TRAI on Jan. 7, 2019 and counter comments to some awful proposals to license the internet and break end-to-end encryption on Jan. 21, 2020. We also attended an open house consultation. IFF is proud to have consistently worked on this issue which only was possible due to the large scale support of our growing membership, community and volunteers. We are happy that the essence of our submissions are reflected in the recommendations of the TRAI on September 14, 2020.\nLet us toast the small victories! On September 14, 2020 the TRAI issued clear recommendations that are broadly supportive of user choice and the submissions and counter-comments submitted by us! These were based on extensive feedback received from the IFF community.\n1. Regulation from evidence on economic issues: The consultation raised some scary scenarios in which online service providers would have to pay telecom operators or share their revenues. This could have had a potential of scaring away global services and dulled local investment and product development. All of this would have impacted the choices for end users.\n What did we demand: “We hold a view that devising regulations to place regulatory burdens or financial levies on internet platforms and services by itself is not a sound public policy measure from the perspective of data. The objective of regulation should not be to protect the profits of companies, it should be to serve public welfare.” [comments / counter comments] What did we get: It’s great that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has taken a considered view and stated that at present that, “market forces may be allowed to respond to the situation without prescribing any regulatory intervention. However, developments shall be monitored and intervention as felt necessary shall be done at appropriate time.” We are largely supportive of this, even as we note that there is greater market concentration in the telecom industry than in the tech sector today. We had made this clear analysis based on data in our preparatory materials for this consultation.  2. A win for security and privacy: Most people in our community know that India lacks any clear, enforceable data protection law. This sucks for users. It puts them to risk. But it was more alarming when suggestions were being made to undermine and break encryption for law enforcement access. This would be a clear threat to the integrity of our communications.\n What did we demand: “We strongly hold onto the position of asking for reform of India’s surveillance law (including introducing judicial oversight such as directed in the Puttaswamy-Aadhaar Judgement) and defending the use and deployment of encryption technologies. We believe both these measures protect the privacy of individuals and also safeguard them from second order impacts such as identity and data theft, which in many cases today lead to social and economic harms.” [comments / counter comments] What did we get: Thankfully, the TRAI has implicitly endorsed the value of encryption technologies when it has stated that, “Imposition of any requirements to cater to get the details of communication in an intelligible form or clear text would either lead to change in the entire architecture of such OTT services which might not provide same level of protection as offered today or would require to introduce provisions which may make the agents involved in the communication vulnerable to unlawful actors.”  3. Regulatory framework for OTT Services: Here we had a more nuanced approach where we stated that telecom side regulation without identifying a core public policy objective (such as data protection) will be problematic. Here, if the objective is to ensure growth of the telecom sector, then having a regulator for OTT Services will be a solution that does not cater to the lack of growth or sustainability of investment. How? Well we cracked some numbers, and the TRAI surveying international practices broadly agreed with this assessment.\n What did we demand: “It bears repetition that the core thesis of a market failure and the need to correct regulatory imbalances is yet to be established. On the contrary our economic analysis shows that the economic stress is due to a period of hyper-competitiveness. We even dispute the arguments for substitutability of services between telcos and internet applications and services.” [comments / counter comments] What did we get: “It is not an opportune moment to recommend a comprehensive regulatory framework for various aspects of services referred to as OTT services, beyond the extant laws and regulations prescribed presently. The matter may be looked into afresh when more clarity emerges in international jurisdictions particularly the study undertaken by ITU.”  As much as we work in a challenging environment, it is important to remember public victories are possible even today. Sometimes, it’s easy if we TRAI! To take forward these victories to a positive conclusion yesterday we wrote to the DOT.\nIn the coming week we will also be addressing recommendations on both the Cloud Services Consultation Paper and the one for Traffic Measurement in which IFF participated to secure the interests of Indian internet users, like you!\nImportant Documents  IFF’s letter to the DOT dated 26.09.2020 in support of TRAI’s recommendations on OTT Services (link) TRAI’s recommendations to the DOT on OTT Licensing (link) IFF\u0026rsquo;s engagement on OTT Licensing Consultation (summary; initial analysis; broad economic trends; comments / counter comments).

We are therefore required to read in the requirement of ensuring that all the orders passed under the Suspension Rules are made freely available, through some suitable mechanism. ”\n As a result we wrote to all the concerned state governments seeking proactive publication of internet shutdown orders in accordance with the judgement of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India. However, we did not receive any response from the state governments.\nAs a next step, we filed Right to Information requests with the states in question wherein we asked them to:\n Provide us with copies of the internet shutdown orders based on which the specific shutdowns took place. State whether they had complied with the decision of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India and if not, the reasons for the failure to comply. Provide us with copies of all orders through which internet shutdowns took place in their state in 2020.  Responses received A. Madhya Pradesh In their reply dated September 3, 2020, “C” Section of Home Department of the Government of Madhya Pradesh stated that the internet shutdown related information that we asked for relates to their department and that they were exempted from disclosure under the RTI Act u/s 24. Section 24 of the RTI Act states that “certain organisations” such as intelligence and security organisations do not come under the purview of the act and can be exempted from disclosure if the government specifically exempts them by notification in the Official Gazette. The Government of Madhya Pradesh has accordingly exempted “C” Section of the Home Department from disclosures which acts as a deterrent to demanding transparency for internet shutdowns in the state.\nB. Meghalaya In their reply dated September 15, 2020, the Home (Political) Department of the Government of Meghalaya has, in response to our query about compliance with the Anuradha Bhasin decision, stated that the department is not aware of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in the matter since they did not receive it. This depicts a clear signal failure due to which the state government has not been made aware of the decision.\n9 months on, still no compliance with the Anuradha Bhasin decision These responses make it clear that states and the Centre have failed to comply with the Anuradha Bhasin decision due to various reasons, whether it is wilful disobedience or due to signal failure. As we have stated previously, publication of internet shutdown orders and proper record-keeping is essential for two reasons. First, without access to internet shutdown orders, citizens cannot exercise their fundamental right to seek judicial review of arbitrary or disproportionate restrictions on internet access. Second, internet shutdowns cause huge economic losses and maintaining a consolidated record of all internet shutdowns imposed at the state and central level is necessary for evidence based policy reform.\nWithout official publication of orders, the only source of information about internet shutdowns in different parts of the country is media reports. However, the figures derived based on media reports do not represent the full scale of the problem and may fail to include shutdowns which are shorter in duration or localized in small towns and villages.\nIn any case, even the limited information which is available through media reports suggests that internet shutdowns are being ordered by government officials who are not authorized under the law. For instance, media reports indicate that internet shutdowns in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were ordered by District Magistrates who are not empowered to exercise powers under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. Prior to 2017, internet shutdowns were ordered by District Magistrates under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. However, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the Supreme Court has clarified that the position of law has changed after notification of the Rules in 2017 and the procedure prescribed under the Rules must be followed prior to imposing internet shutdowns.\nImportant Documents  Copies of RTI applications, replies and appeals (link) 6 months after Anuradha Bhasin v.

Our primary demands are that deployment of any digital health ID programme must be preceded by (a) enactment of general and sectoral data protection laws by the Parliament of India; and (b) meaningful public consultation which reaches out to vulnerable groups which face the greatest privacy risks.\nBackground The public consultation being conducted by the National Health Authority for the National Digital Health Mission’s Health Data Management Policy (Draft Policy) has been the subject of intense controversy. Earlier this month, a petition was also filed before the Delhi High Court by Dr. Satendra Singh, a noted disability rights activist, which raised concerns about the unreasonably short deadline for submission of feedback at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted how the existing process excludes persons with disabilities, non-English speakers and people without internet access (Read more here).\nSubsequent to the hearing before the Delhi High Court, the National Health Authority announced that the deadline for submission of feedback would be extended till 21 September 2020 and people could send their feedback through offline modes such as post or courier as well. It also indicated that it was undertaking measures to make the consultation process accessible for persons with disabilities in accordance with existing government policy. However, despite these concessions, the consultation process still remained violative of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, Official Languages Act 1963 and the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy 2014 (Read more here).\nIFF’s submission to NHA In our submission to the National Health Authority, we have highlighted five key legal and technical concerns associated with the Draft Policy and the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) more generally.\n(i) Lack of data protection legislation\nThe submission emphasizes on the importance of an underlying legislative framework by relying on standards established by international bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations HIV/AIDS Programme (UNAIDS) for national digital ID projects. Our submission notes that ensuring health data privacy requires legislation at three levels- comprehensive laws, sectoral laws and informal rules. Applying this framework to India, we demonstrate that India neither has a comprehensive law since the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is still pending in Parliament, nor does it have a sectoral law like the proposed but yet to be enacted Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act, 2018. Viewed through this lens, the Draft Policy can at best be considered a set of informal rules which lack any statutory basis.\nIn addition to WHO, UNAIDS has also emphasized that national level privacy legislation is necessary to address privacy concerns associated with national health IDs. The UNAIDS Report further states that prior to deployment of any national health ID programme, “it is essential to engage with people living with HIV and members of key populations and other vulnerable groups, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs and people with disabilities, so potential concerns such as access to cards and care, risk of unlawful access and use by law enforcement agencies and others can be identified and addressed.” The consultation process for the Draft Policy which has only been published on the internet in English and which was not accessible for persons with disabilities clearly falls short of these standards established by UNAIDS.\n(ii) De facto mandatory nature of Digital Health ID Programme\nAs reported by various media publications, registration for a health ID under the NDHM may be voluntary on paper but it is being made mandatory in practice by hospital administrators and heads of departments. As doctors from Chandigarh quoted in the Caravan note “It feels like strong-arming really\u0026hellip;There is a hierarchy and we have to follow orders, even if they don’t give it in writing, if your HOD asks you to register you have to register” and “They keep asking to give constant updates on how many members from our department have registered with the health ID, and so everyone has to ensure they have registered otherwise the HOD will know, and who knows what the repercussions will be.”\nThe de facto mandatory nature of the digital health ID programme under NDHM can be addressed only if it supported by an underlying legislation which clearly places a bar on denial of healthcare services because of lack of a digital health ID, and prescribes strict penalties for erring government officials who make use of such health IDs mandatory.\n(iii) Linkage of Aadhaar with Digital Health ID\nThe use of Aadhaar number for the purposes of authentication of identity at the time of registration raises serious privacy concerns about linkage of a person’s health data with other databases, and it increases the likelihood of the National Digital Health Ecosystem being connected with systems beyond the health sector.\nAdditionally, the non-inclusion of official identifiers like Aadhaar number within the definition of sensitive personal data under the Draft Policy is inconsistent with the government’s own Personal Data Protection Bill and may lead to inadequate protection being provided to Aadhaar details shared by participants in NDHM.\n(iv) Risk of re-identification of anonymized data\nThe Draft Policy does not adequately address concerns about reidentification of de-identified or anonymized health data which is now widely understood to be a real threat. For instance, researchers have been able to re-identify 43% of known patients by matching de-identified data sets against news reports. Researchers have also found that 87% of the population in the United States can be uniquely identified based on only three characteristics - ZIP, gender, date of birth - and proven that any data set which includes these highly identifying characteristics cannot not be considered anonymized.\n(v) Threat of data breaches\nExecutives in the healthcare sector have recognized the cybersecurity risks posed by the NDHM. Further, India has a past record of breaches of sensitive personal data like financial information. For instance, in 2016, 3.2 million debit cards were recalled by various banks due to a data breach. Any similar leak of sensitive health data collected as part of NDHM would cause severe and irreparable harm to millions of citizens which cannot be quantified or compensated in monetary terms. For this reason, it is essential that independent technical experts are provided more time to thoroughly scrutinize the National Digital Health Ecosystem’s technical design and there should be full disclosure of all information that is necessary to conduct such an independent evaluation.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s submission dated 21.09.2020 to the National Health Authority (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/ndhm-data-privacy-policy-consultation-submission/","summary":"We wrote to the National Health Authority seeking enactment of general and sectoral data protection laws and meaningful public consultation prior to deployment of any national digital health ID programme.","title":"Move fast, break things?

Chidambaram to strengthen the internal security architecture of the country. The pilot testing of the Core Application Software (CAS) was started in 15 locations across Assam, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, from 1st October 2011. The testing continued till January, 2013. During the testing, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)/National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) closely monitored the progress and collected the feedback for issue resolution. The pilot launch of CCTNS was done by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on January 4, 2013 at New Delhi.\nThe Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) Project was originally scheduled to be implemented by March, 2015. The implementation of CCTNS is being done in a phased manner and has faced consistent delays. According to the CCTNS Pragati Dashboard Report dated July 31, 2020, overall implementation of the project is currently at 77.8%.\nOn January 1, 2019, in response to a parliamentary question the then Minister of State in the Ministry Of Home Affairs, Shri Hansraj Gangaram Ahir stated that, “The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) has been rolled out nationally and as on 30.11.2018, it has been deployed in 14764 police stations in the country.”\nThe total estimated cost of this Project is 2000 Crore INR during the 11th Five Year Plan and the actual expenditure as on March 6, 2018 is 1451.398 crore INR.\nWhat is CCTNS? The CCTNS was envisaged as a system which would help police stations across the country to “talk” to each other. The aim of the project is to digitise all information related to FIRs registered, cases investigated, and charge sheets filed in all police stations, in order to develop a national database of crime and criminals. This project, which is proposed to be implemented as a Mission Mode Project under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) of Govt. of India, aims at creating a comprehensive and integrated system for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of policing at police station level through adoption of principles of e-Governance by creation of a nationwide networked infrastructure for evolution of IT-enabled state-of–the-art tracking system around “investigation of crime and detection of criminals”. The National Crime Records Bureau is the nodal project implementation agency for review, monitoring and coordination of the project under the overall guidance of the Ministry of Home Affairs.\nOn December 8, 2015, in response to a parliamentary question, the then Minister Of State In The Ministry Of Home Affairs, Shri Haribhai Parathibhai Chaudhary stated the aim of the project as under:\n To fully computerise the process of crime registration, investigation, prosecution etc. in all police stations in the country\n  To create a central database to provide national level search facility as well as crime analytics for use by police and central agencies\n  To electronically share data/information among Police Stations \u0026amp; Police Higher Offices\n  Computerisation of all prisons and provision of necessary hardware, software etc.\n  To provide citizen services through a Citizen Portal\n  Sharing of Crime and Criminal related data with Police, Prosecution, Courts, Prison and Forensics leading to Integrated Criminal Justice System\n What are the privacy concerns surrounding CCTNS? CCTNS is being implemented in the country without a data protection law in place. This leads to privacy concerns because the CCTNS is proposed to be integrated with various projects such the National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) and the National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS). Integration of the CCTNS with these projects would thus allow the state to create complete profiles of citizens. Both these projects have been red-flagged by privacy experts and civil society organisations as potential tools of mass surveillance in the hands of the state. (Read here and here)\nFor example, in a situation where a person has been wrongfully arrested, the integration of their data into the CCTNS would lead to further violations of their rights. This is because their data is now available to the NATGRID and the AFRS. This allows the government to track their every movement and ultimately violates their fundamental rights.\nWho will ‘watch the watchmen’?

This joint statement was drafted by the Forum for Medical Ethics Society, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, All India People’s Science Network and Internet Freedom Foundation based on multi-domain experience and it situates COVID-19 apps like Aarogya Setu within the public health system in India. The joint statement also presents a clear set of 16 demands to safeguard sensitive personal data of citizens and prevent exclusion.\nBackground The Aarogya Setu mobile app was introduced by the government as a proximity exposure notification app on 02 April 2020 and it has been mired in controversy since its release. Concerns have been raised about commercial or law enforcement use of sensitive personal data collected by the app by legal commentators who have cautioned against deployment of such technologies in the absence of a data protection law in India. Public health experts have also explained why such technologies cannot replace on the ground contract tracing by healthcare workers and questioned the government\u0026rsquo;s failure to explain why information available in existing government databases is insufficient. Finally, technologists have warned that Aarogya Setu adopts weak anonymization practices which make its users susceptible to re-identification and criticized the lack of transparency surrounding the app\u0026rsquo;s code and algorithms.\nJoint statement by multi-domain civil society groups This joint statement was drafted by the Forum for Medical Ethics Society, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, All India People’s Science Network and Internet Freedom Foundation and it has been endorsed by 8 organizations and 145 individuals. The other four endorsee organizations are Janchetna Sansthan, Lok Manch, Rethink Aadhaar Campaign India and the Right To Food Campaign. A full list of endorsees can be found in the joint statement linked at the bottom of this post.\nYesterday i.e. 17 September 2020, we sent the joint statement to the Ministry of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare, Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology. The statement presents a clear set of 16 demands to safeguard sensitive personal data of citizens and prevent exclusion in access to healthcare and other essential facilities which are listed below.\nI. For proportionality\n There is a constitutional obligation to adopt the least restrictive/intrusive measure to achieve the stated purpose. These thresholds can be benchmarked against known technological best practices and models, and the kinds of interventions adopted by other constitutional democracies. The design ofinterventions must also ensure that they do not disproportionately impact people from certain backgrounds, identities, and regions. A full release of specifications including cryptography, anonymization specifications, Application Programming Interface (API) specifications, and Bluetooth specifications. Release of the source code for the current version of the AS App, given the fact that the released code does not match with the one in use, and release of the server-side code. Development of a comprehensive privacy impact assessment, articulating accompanying risks associated with large scale roll-out of the App. Commitment (i.e. sunset clauses that are clearly present in primary legislation) to permanently destroy the data and systems being built via AS App at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The AS App must not in any way be made mandatory by government or private actors; Among other things, the focus must be on assuring the public that these are temporary interventions which will not devolve into permanent surveillance and monitoring systems.  II. For legality\n Suitable legislation is required aim to hold the Union and State governments and private actors accountable for leakage or any inappropriate use of App data during epidemics and communicable disease outbreaks. Under this legislative framework, governments may only access patient data through hospital records, and must preserve patient anonymity. These frameworks should be solely under the control of public health institutions.  III. For necessity\n The government must establish contextual necessity of the new technological interventions like the AS App which monitors people’s movements since this is already being done by other actors (like telecom service providers).; Grounds for treating the existing government databases, such as those maintained by ICMR and other existing surveillance mechanisms and hospital records as inadequate for the current purposes of responding to the pandemic The expected advantage of interventions for collection of health and related information is collected, the actual technical effectiveness of the interventions itself, and a detailed cost-benefit/privacy impact analysis to evaluate risks before rolling out such Apps Necessity as a dynamic construct, and that it is embedded through the life cycle of the AS programme. Within it there is a need for continual review of the programme as regards principles of transparency and accountability.  IV. Oversight Structures and Processes\n The required legislation must create independent institutions for oversight separated from the political executive. Towards this end, the agencies/institutions concerned should publish periodic reports informing the public if, and to what extent, the App is augmenting the Government’s response in treating and containing the spread of Covid-19. Based on such feedback loops, these institutions should be empowered to make decisions for course correction or even discontinuation of the programme itself,and the permanent destruction of the systems created.

It has been set up by the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) and is operated by the Telecom Enforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM) cells under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Like the NATGRID, the CMS has also been developed by the government to strengthen the security structure of the country.\nHistory Post the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, a need was felt for greater coordination between law enforcement and security agencies. CMS is one of the multiple projects that the government initiated in 2009 in order to fill the gaps in India’s internal security structure. The project was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on 16th June 2011 and the pilot project was completed by 30th September 2011.\nThe estimated budget for the project was 400 crore INR however the actual cost of the project is said to be higher.\nThe project, which was first envisaged in 2009, was delayed multiple times and finally operationalised in 2013 however the implementation is being done in phases.\nWhat is CMS? CMS aims to automate the process of lawful interception \u0026amp; monitoring of telecommunications. Before CMS, law enforcement agencies had to approach individual telecom service providers (TSP) for interception of communications of targets such as suspected terrorists or criminals. However, CMS aims to remove or bypass the middle man, i.e., TSPs, and allow the law enforcement agency to monitor the target through a central system.\nIn order to bypass the TSPs, the CMS was provided unfettered access to the existing Lawful Interception Systems (LIS). LIS was a frequently used uniform platform for law enforcement agencies to track and gather cell and internet records. All service providers in the country were required to have LIS installed in their premises. Interception through LIS happened by interception requests which were made by law enforcement agencies to the Nodal Officers of the TSPs. However, under the CMS, the TSPs were made to integrate the LIS with Interception Store \u0026amp; Forward (ISF) servers. These servers are connected to the Regional Monitoring Centres (RMC) of CMS allowing them direct access to all intercepted data of the TSPs. These RMCs can be accessed directly by any participating law enforcement agency through the CMS, surpassing the need to contact TSPs and essentially automating the entire process. Whereas before the government had to request that user information be monitored and turned over to the authorities, under CMS the Indian government can “tap into communications at will without telling the service providers.”\nOn August 7, 2013, in response to a parliamentary question, the Minister of State in the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology Milind Deora stated that the envisaged salient features of CMS are as follows:\n Direct Electronic Provisioning of target number by a Government agency without any manual intervention from Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) on a secured network, thus enhancing the secrecy level and quick provisioning of target. Central and regional database which will help Central and State level Law Enforcement Agencies in Interception and Monitoring. Analysis of Call Data Records (CDR) to help in establishing linkage between anti-social /anti-national elements. Research and Development (R\u0026amp;D) in related fields for continuous up-gradation of the CMS.  The participating law enforcement agencies of the CMS are:\n Intelligence Bureau (IB) Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) Research \u0026amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) National Investigation Agency (NIA) Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Enforcement Directorate (ED) Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Directorate of Signal Intelligence Commissioner of Police, Delhi  What are the privacy concerns surrounding CMS? Interception through CMS will thus be done by these agencies directly without any need to approach individual service providers.\nOn August 7, 2013, in response to a parliamentary question the Minister of State in the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology Milind Deora stated:\n “To take care of the privacy of citizens, lawful interception and monitoring is governed by the section 5(2) of Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 read with rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007 wherein oversight mechanism exists in form of review committee under chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary at Central Government level and Chief Secretary of the State at the State Government level. The same mechanism is applicable for the interception under the CMS Project also. Additionally, there is an inbuilt mechanism of check and balance as Security Agencies/Law Enforcement Agencies cannot provision the target and the provisioning agency cannot see the content.”\n In the absence of a data protection law in India and without any intermediaries in place, the process through which interception would be done under the CMS lacks transparency. This means that the general public will not know if and when a person’s data has been intercepted. It would also be difficult to ascertain whether there was a valid reason for this interception. A practice of mass surveillance could be adopted wherein large groups of people have their data intercepted without a valid reason. Since these interception authorisations will be done by the government agencies internally, there will be no way of knowing about them and whether they were done for a valid reason, let alone questioning or challenging them.\nThe prevailing legal regime regarding privacy can thus be reduced to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1) which states that any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy, which is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution, must conform to certain thresholds which include legality, necessity, proportionality and procedural safeguards.\nThe threshold of legality requires that the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. The CMS does not have any anchoring legislation and thus fails to meet this threshold.\nThe threshold of procedural safeguards requires that there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. As stated above, the CMS has an in-built mechanism of check and balances. While we can appreciate the spirit of this measure, it is not sufficient to quell any privacy concerns as there is no independent oversight. Independent oversight is necessary to ensure that invalid interception requests are not authorised by law enforcement agencies.\nSurveillance laws in India and a need for reform The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, deals with interception of calls under Section 5(2), and the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, deals with interception of data under Section 69. Under both laws, only the government, under certain circumstances, is permitted to conduct surveillance. Security of the state is a common reason under both the provisions pursuant to which the government can issue orders for surveillance. However, it was felt that these provisions lack procedural safeguards which would ensure that they are used by the government in a justified manner. Thus, the government enacted specific rules [ rule 419A of Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007 and the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009] under which orders for interceptions of communication can only be issued by the Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs and orders for the interception, monitoring or decryption of any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource can only be issued by the Union Home Secretary or State Secretaries in charge of the Home Departments. However, as can be seen above the Government has now authorised upto ten agencies for purposes of interception, monitoring and decryption of any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource under the IT act.\nThe present surveillance architecture in India is thus too weak and can be seen to be prone to mass surveillance. Hopes were set on the upcoming Personal Data Protection Bill to provide some level of protection however as the draft stands currently, Clause 35 of the Bill empowers the Central Government to exempt by an order, ‘any agency’ of the government from all or any provisions of the data protection law if it is in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations, public order and to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence.\nIt is our view that these existing exemptions are too vague and broad and must be narrowly tailored. A complete chapter on surveillance reform needs to be inserted in the present PDP Bill. Government agencies responsible for carrying out surveillance and interception as part of their law enforcement functions must be clearly identified, notified, and bound by the provisions of the Bill. In addition to a stronger data protection law, India also needs a separate legislation to regulate surveillance by the government to ensure that state sponsored mass surveillance does not become a reality in India.\nWho will ‘watch the watchmen’? This look into CMS is the second part of IFF’s new series called Watch the Watchmen. Through this series we aim to look into and analyse the looming surveillance technology threats in India.\nImportant Documents  Watch the Watchmen Series Part 1 : The National Intelligence Grid dated September 2, 2020 (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law dated February 28, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/watch-the-watchmen-series-part-2-the-centralised-monitoring-system/","summary":"In the second part of our Watch the Watchmen series, we take a look at the Centralised Monitoring System (CMS) which aims to automate the process of lawful interception \u0026amp; monitoring of telecommunications.","title":"Watch the Watchmen Series Part 2 : The Centralised Monitoring System"},{"content":"  Tl;dr We wrote to the Ministry of Health \u0026amp; Family Welfare and the National Health Authority after the Delhi High Court directed the government to decide concerns surrounding the consultation for the National Digital Health Mission\u0026rsquo;s Health Data Management Policy in accordance with existing laws, rules and policies. The representation was sent by Dr. Satendra Singh, the petitioner before the Delhi High Court and it highlights how the consultation process is still in violation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, Official Languages Act 1963 and the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy 2014. The representation urges the government to re-calculate 30 days for submission of feedback after implementing recommended changes and to extend the deadline.\nBackground On 03 September 2020, the Delhi High Court heard a writ petition filed by Dr. Satendra Singh, a doctor and noted disability activist, which challenged the consultation process for the National Digital Health Mission\u0026rsquo;s Health Data Management Policy. The petition raised concerns about the unreasonably short deadline for submission of feedback at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted how the existing process excludes persons with disabilities, non-English speakers and people without internet access. In its order, the Delhi High Court directed the government to consider the petitioner\u0026rsquo;s representation in accordance with laws, rules and policies, and further noted that inadequate public consultation could be raised as a ground if the Draft Policy was challenged after its notification (Read more here).\nSubsequent to the hearing before the Delhi High Court, the National Health Authority announced that the deadline for submission of feedback would be extended till 21 September 2020 and people could send their feedback through offline modes such as post or courier as well. It also indicated that it was undertaking measures to make the consultation process accessible for persons with disabilities in accordance with existing government policy.\nWhat problems remain? The representation acknowledges the steps taken by the government to improve the consultation process but explains that several statutory obligations and policy commitments have still not been complied with.\n Violation of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016Section 46 of the RPWD Act provides all government and private websites a time period of two years to make information and communication technology accessible to persons with disabilities in the manner required under Section 42 of the RPWD Act and Rule 15(c) of the RPWD Rules. Since the RPWD Rules were notified on 15 June 2017, the deadline to make all government and private websites accessible was 15 June 2019.Yet in August 2020, National Health Authority introduced an inaccessible measure in the online form for the consultation for the Draft Policy on its website. The online form requires the user to fill an image CAPTCHA which is inaccessible for persons with visual impairment, who are protected under Clause 1(B) of the Schedule to RPWD Act. Further, an alternative option of making submissions by email has not been provided either. While submissions can be sent via post or courier, this is significantly more cumbersome and cannot be the only alternative available to persons with visual impairments who have a statutorily guaranteed right to access government websites on an equal basis. The use of image CAPTCHA in the absence of any accessible alternatives also violates Clause 6.6.3 of the Guidelines for Indian Government Websites issued under Rule 15(c) of the RPWD Rules. Violation of Official Languages Act, 1963At present, the Draft Policy is only available in English, and translated versions are not available for any of the 22 languages recognized under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. At the bare minimum, the Draft Policy must be translated to Hindi since there is a statutory obligation under Section 4(i) of the Official Languages Act, 1963 to publish all resolutions, general orders, rules, notifications, administrative or other reports or press communiques issued by the Central Government in both English and Hindi. Inconsistency with Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy, 2014The Draft Policy has been published on the official NDHM website but there is a need to give it wide publicity through print and electronic media to reach citizens who may not have access to the internet. This approach is also supported by the Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy issued by the Ministry of Law \u0026amp; Justice which recognized the importance of dissemination of information through mediums besides the internet as well. While the government has allowed citizens to submit feedback via post and courier to account for the Digital Divide, there is a need to proactively disseminate information about the consultation through traditional media as well. The Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy also requires the government to provide the public at least 30 days to submit feedback. In the present case, the consultation was publicly announced through a press release on 26 August 2020 and the deadline for submission of feedback is 21 September 2020 despite the prevailing COVID-19 crisis in the country.  Recommendations In order to address the above mentioned problems in the consultation process, the representation makes the following five demands:\n Modify or remove the image CAPTCHA present in the online form for submission for feedback using output modes for different types of sensory perception to accommodate different disabilities (visual impairment as well as deaf-blindness). Examples of multimodal options empowering choice to people with varying disabilities include image CAPTCHA, audio CAPTCHA, text-based logic CAPTCHA, SMS OTP CAPTCHA, e-mail OTP with click link to verify CAPTCHA. Provide an email address for submission of feedback, as has been done with previous policy consultations for the Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules 2019, Cosmetic Rules 2018, Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 and Report on Non-Personal Data Governance Framework. Translate and publish the Draft Health Data Management Policy in Hindi at the very least, and in other languages recognized under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution as far as possible. Widely publicize the consultation through print and electronic media. Re-calculate 30 days for submission of feedback from the date of implementing the above mentioned changes and extend the deadline for the consultation.

We specifically highlighted how this is affecting students in the state who now have to take extreme measures to access online classes during the pandemic. We asked them to ensure that the BharatNet Project, which aims to provide fast internet connectivity to the whole country, is operationalised according to pre-existing timelines so that these issues can be resolved.\nLet’s talk about Odisha The State of Odisha has long been failing to keep up with the national average when it comes to internet connectivity. According to a report by Diana Sahu, “tele-density in rural Odisha is 42.7 pc whereas in urban areas it was 171 pc.” She also referred to the Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators reports by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which state that, as on September 30, 2019, Odisha’s rural wireless tele-density stood at 59.5 pc against 145.3 pc in urban areas.\nOut of Odisha’s total 32.8 million wireless internet subscribers, 21 million are in rural areas. As far as the internet through wireline or cable is concerned, of the total 0.23 million subscribers in Odisha, only 0.05 million are from rural areas. Rural Odisha’s wireline density is just 0.13 pc. Sahu concludes that “the share of internet subscribers per 100 individuals is just 29.5 pc in rural areas which is substantially below the national average.”\nWhat is the situation now? The COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to be dependent on the internet for access to basic necessities like government services and schemes, online education etc. In the present situation, lack of internet connectivity can cause extreme harms to any such affected area. We have been working consistently on the issues surrounding lack of internet connectivity in -\n Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands which suffers from a lack of digital infrastructure; and Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which has been tolerating internet shutdowns for more than a year now.  In both these areas, we have focused our advocacy efforts on how a lack of internet connectivity affects the daily lives and livelihoods of ordinary citizens. In Odisha as well, we have been following how the lack of digital infrastructure is affecting its citizens.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated structural disparities between rural and urban areas. It has had a critical impact on the education of children, especially the disadvantaged ones. Subhashish Mohanty reports that students in the Sambalpur district of Odisha climb a water tank 150 feet high to access the internet to participate in their online classes. Another report quoted the Odisha School and Mass Education Minister Samir Ranjan Dash who said that “due to poor internet connectivity in the state many students have to walk miles, climb hills and trees to attend online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.”\nThe BharatNet Project The BharatNet project, which initially began as the National Optical Fibre Network on October 25, 2011, had a targeted completion date of October 2013. The Cabinet has approved the implementation of National Optical Fiber Network (NOFN) for providing broadband connectivity to 2,50,000 Gram Panchayats with a financial outlay of Rs. 20,100 crore. This project is being executed by Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL) under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), Department of Telecommunications(DoT). The USOF aims to provide Universal Service to all areas of the country through network extension \u0026amp; stimulate uptake of the information and communications technology services. Section 3(1A) of Telegraph Act, 1885 defines Universal Service Obligation as :\n “Universal Service Obligation\u0026quot; means the obligation to provide access to telegraph services to people in the rural and remote areas at affordable and reasonable prices;\n However, while the project has lofty aims, it has not been able to live up to them. The project has been delayed consistently. The Committee to review the National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) in the context of Digital India was constituted on January 14, 2015. In their report titled “Report of the Committee on National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN)” dated March 31, 2015, they stated that the project could be commissioned by 2017 however those deadlines were also not met. The current deadline for the project is August 2021.\nAccording to a report by Aashish Aryan, “Overall, under all the phases of BharatNet, a total of 1.41 GP had been connected and made service ready as against a target of 2.5 lakh. Compounding the problem further, an estimated 19,952 km of lossy optical fibre out of the 27,534 km laid by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) under phase one is now being pulled out and replaced by new optical fibre, the official said, adding the work on that project was also “crawling at a very slow pace”. As of January, progress in states like Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, and Odisha under BharatNet phase two was the worst. The number of service-ready GPs in these states had not even touched 1 per cent of the total 28,623 villages planned to be connected by March 2019. The four states had so far spent about Rs 950 crore, nearly 17 percent of approved project cost.”\nAccess to Internet is essential In __ Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India [2020 SCC OnLine SC 25], it was held that the internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights provided by the Constitution of India. The judgement states that expressing one’s views or conducting one’s business through the internet are protected under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution respectively. However, does the Government have a positive obligation to provide access to the internet?\nThe National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP), 2018 seeks to unlock the transformative power of digital communications networks - to achieve the goal of digital empowerment and improved well-being of the people of India. To this end the NDCP attempts to outline a set of goals, initiatives, strategies and intended policy outcomes. This policy has three missions, the first of which is “Connect India: Creating Robust Digital Communications Infrastructure”. The aim of this mission is to promote Broadband for All as a tool for socio-economic development, while ensuring service quality and environmental sustainability.\nOur recommendations to the DoT As can be seen, while the delay in the operationalisation of the BharatNet Project in Odisha has been overlooked in the past, the current situation makes access to the internet essential. Therefore, we wrote to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) with a list of recommendations specifically for Odisha:\n The USOF division of the DoT must implement the BharatNet project according to pre-existing timelines, and if they are not able to do so they must make public the reasons for this. They should also then provide clear timelines in which they estimate the work will be completed which should include a monthly breakdown of work completed. They should also announce an explicit last date by when the project is complete and a detailed timeline with expected benchmarks. BBNL must highlight if they face any regulatory hurdles, so that those can be worked on by the DoT and the USOF division, BBNL and local municipal authorities. In the interim, vulnerable populations should be provided with subsidised broad based internet based services/transaction opportunities at CSCs, kiosks, post offices, legal services authorities, cyber cafes, etc. Funds should also be allocated under USOF and national/state disaster relief funds for subsidised access to internet connectivity and internet enabled devices. Special subsidies can be designed for students, healthcare workers and senior citizens.  Help us map the Digital Divide in India In a reply to a question in Lok Sabha, Sanjay Dhotre, MoS for Communications, Human Resource Development and Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology said that, “In 27,721 villages of India, there are still no mobile connections due to various issues”. Odisha trails the most with 6,549 villages without any mobile network. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh follow Odisha with 2000-3000 villages without any mobile network. This sets back our fellow Indians, from the benefit of fast and affordable 4G internet.\nIf you live in such a region that lacks mobile internet infrastructure and want to help us in mapping this digital divide, please fill out the form below.

The petition raised concerns about the unreasonably short deadline for submission of feedback at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted how the existing process excludes persons with disabilities, non-English speakers and people without internet access. After hearing the petitioner\u0026rsquo;s counsel, the Delhi High Court directed the government to consider the petitioner\u0026rsquo;s representation and noted that inadequate public consultation could be raised as a ground if the Draft Policy was challenged after its notification.\nBackground The National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) was announced by the Prime Minister on the 74th Independence Day, and it envisages the creation of a National Digital Health Ecosystem with six key features- HealthID, DigiDoctor, Health Facility Registry, Personal Health Records, Telemedicine, and e-Pharmacy. A government press release **** describes NDHM as: “Every Indian citizen will get a Health ID which will be a repository of all health-related information, of a person, such as medical tests, previous prescriptions, diagnosis, treatments, all historical health records” and that “private stakeholders’ will have an equal opportunity to integrate with these building blocks and create their own products for the market.”\nWithin the first two week of its launch on 15 August 2020, health IDs were created for 55,700 individuals under NDHM. After launching the programme in six Union Territories, the National Health Authority issued a press release on 26 August 2020 announcing the public consultation for the Draft Health Data Management Policy for NDHM and the deadline to submit feedback was 03 September 2020. On 31 August 2020, the deadline was extended by another week till 5:00 PM on 10 September 2020.\nPetition before Delhi High Court A writ petition was filed by Dr. Satendra Singh, a doctor and noted disability rights activist, before the Delhi High Court earlier this week which challenged the consultation process for the Draft Health Data Management Policy. The petition outlined four major problems with the consultation process which undermined minimum requirements for public participation in democratic decision-making.\n ___Short 15 day timeline___The consultation is being conducted in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic when functioning of individuals and organizations is disrupted and people are finding it difficult to organize, collaborate, hold meetings etc. Analysis of the Draft Policy also requires multidisciplinary expertise in computer science, law, public health and medical ethics. Therefore, people need more time to consult and confer with experts and other stakeholders. In particular, healthcare workers are fully engrossed in management of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is unreasonable to expect them to analyze and evaluate such a complex policy document within 15 days. ___Inaccessibility for persons with visual impairments___In order to participate in the public consultation, an individual is required to fill the form available on NDHM’s website. At present, the form cannot be filled by persons with visual disabilities since the user must fill a CAPTCHA prior to submitting their response. A CAPTCHA cannot be read by screen reading software used by persons with visual disabilities, and in the absence of any alternatives, its use violates rights guaranteed under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. Persons with disabilities have distinct healthcare related rights and are specifically-impacted stakeholders to NDHM. Therefore, the consultation process must be conducted in a manner that satisfies the government\u0026rsquo;s statutory obligation to provide reasonable accomodation under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. ___Online-only mode of engagement___The consultation process is entirely online even though only 54% of the Indian population has access to the internet. This is contrary to the 2014 Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy, which recognized that every draft for consultation must be published not just on the internet but also by other means. English-_only mode of engagement___The Health Data Management Policy is only available in English and translated versions are not available for any of the 22 official languages recognized under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.The lack of translated versions will massively undermine the ability of the public to participate in the consultation process since census data suggests that around 13 crore people in India speak English, which is barely 10% of the country’s total population.  What happened during the hearing? The writ petition filed by Dr. Satendra Singh was listed before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan of the Delhi High Court. During the hearing, the bench indicated that it could not go into the matter at this stage, especially since there was no statutory obligation to hold public consultation. It should be noted that NDHM and the Draft Policy do not have any basis in legislation, and therefore, a statutory obligation to hold public consultation is not possible. However, despite this, the Court directed the government to consider the petitioner\u0026rsquo;s representation sent on 29 August 2020 in accordance with existing laws, rules and policies. The Court also noted that the issue of lack of meaningful public consultation could be raised as a ground of challenge if the Draft Policy is challenged on substantive grounds after its notification.\nThis blogpost will be updated once the final order of the Delhi High Court is published and to provide updates about follow up actions including further representations and RTIs. IFF provided legal support for this case, and the petitioner was represented in today\u0026rsquo;s hearing by a legal team comprising of Advocates Rajshekhar Rao, Vinayak Mehrotra, Vrinda Bhandari, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay and Sanjana Srikumar.\nImportant Documents  Writ Petition filed by Dr. Satendra Singh (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/ndhm-data-policy-delhi-hc/","summary":"The petition heard by the Delhi HC raised concerns about the unreasonably short deadline for submission of feedback at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlighted how the existing process excludes persons with disabilities, non-English speakers and people without internet access.","title":"Delhi HC directs govt to consider  representation regarding national Health Data Management Policy #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  tl;dr The National Intelligence Grid, better known as NATGRID, is an integrated IT solution which would allow user agencies to access data gathered from various databases such as credit and debit cards, tax, telecom, immigration, airlines and railway tickets, passports, driving licenses among others. It is being developed as a measure to help security agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Research \u0026amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) etc. in tackling crime and terror threats in the country.\nHistory Security is a state subject and the police forces are controlled by the state governments, thereby giving the states the exclusive power to legislate with respect to the police system and exercise full administrative control over the police. Post the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, a need was felt for facilitating higher coordination between the intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. NATGRID aims to mitigate a vital deficiency — lack of real time information, which was considered to be one of the major hurdles in detecting US terror suspect David Headley\u0026rsquo;s movement across the country during his multiple visits between 2006 and 2009. ****\nNATGRID was conceptualized by then Home Minister P. Chidambaram in 2009, in a bid to revamp India’s internal security structure and create a centralized database which can be accessed easily by intelligence agencies at the national level. NATGRID was set up as an attached Office of the Ministry of Home Affairs with effect from December 1, 2010. Further, Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has “in-principle” approved the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of NATGRID on June 6, 2011. Planning Commission also accorded its ‘In Principle’ approval to the project on July 8, 2011, as a ‘Central Plan Scheme’ under MHA from 2011-12.\nThe year-wise break-up of expenditure in setting up NATGRID, which was disclosed in Parliament on March 1, 2016 is as under:\n   Year Expenditure (Rs. in crores)     2009-10 0.075   2010-11 10.19   2011-12 18.61   2012-13 9.68   2013-14 29.03   2014-15 30.63   2015-16 (Upto 31.01.2016) 49.50 (Provisional)    According to reports, it has a total budget of 3,400 crore INR.\nHowever, the proposed solution has been on hold since then and has not been launched in the ten years since. On November 19, 2019, in response to a parliamentary question the Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy stated that the project has developed application software for Proof of Technology (POT) and NATGRID is planned to go live on December 31, 2020.\nWhat is NATGRID? The NATGRID is conceived to be a framework which will leverage Information Technology to connect approved User Agencies (security/law enforcement) with designated Data providers (Airlines, Banks, SEBI, Railway, Telecom etc.) with a view to enhance the country’s counter- terrorism capability. The platform envisages approved operating procedures and oversight mechanisms to facilitate access between users and providers to enable them to analyze and disseminate information/intelligence for synergizing efforts to counter terrorism related activity.\nThe proposed user agencies of the NATGRID are:\n Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research \u0026amp; Analysis Wing (R\u0026amp;AW), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Enforcement Directorate (ED), Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), Directorate General of Central Excise and Intelligence (DGCEI) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).  No state agency is included in the proposed user agencies for NATGRID.\nIn the first phase, these 10 user agencies and 21 service providers will be connected. Later, about 1,950 additional organisations will be linked in the subsequent phases. These service or data providers will provide access to data related to immigration entry and exit, banking and financial transactions, telecommunications including mobile numbers, vehicle numbers, passport details and, in later phases, train and air ticketing details.\nIt has been reported that NATGRID will also have access to the Income Tax Department\u0026rsquo;s PAN records and individual taxpayers' data. “According to an order issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the department will share \u0026lsquo;bulk information\u0026rsquo;, starting from the Permanent Account Number (PAN) to the taxpayer\u0026rsquo;s name and all the individual data that it captures like father\u0026rsquo;s name, gender, date of birth, photograph and signature or thumb impression. The department will also share with the National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) all information available in the department\u0026rsquo;s database regarding residential and office addresses and phone and mobile numbers of all the taxpayers.”\nReports have also suggested that the government could link social media accounts of individuals with NATGRID as well. However, this move has faced severe resistance from the intelligence agencies, whose officials fear that linking the social media accounts to sensitive government data could expose the system to “trojan attacks.”\nNATGRID will utilise Big Data and Analytics to study huge amounts of data generated from 21 data sources of various intelligence and enforcement agencies to analyse events in order to get a better picture as well as to trail suspects.\nNATGRID is currently headed by IAS officer Ashish Gupta. There are around 70 personnel, drawn from both the government and private sectors, in NATGRID. The main office complex for NATGRID is being constructed in New Delhi with a data recovery centre in Bengaluru.\nWhat could go wrong? On March 13, 2012, the then Minister of State for Home Affairs Jitendra Singh in response to a parliamentary question acknowledged that the government is cognizant of the privacy concerns surrounding NATGRID. He further stated that, “NATGRID’s security framework has been designed to protect secrecy and privacy of information within the NATGRID system. The extant legal regime regarding privacy ipso-facto applies to NATGRID.”\nThe Right to Information Act, 2000 which aims to bring transparency and accountability to government authorities contains a provision which exempts intelligence agencies from its purview under S.24(2) of the Act. NATGRID is exempted from the RTI Act, 2005 vide Gazette of India Notification No. GSR 442 (E) dated 09.06.2011 issued by DOP\u0026amp;T.\nIn addition to being exempt from the RTI Act, NATGRID is also being developed and deployed in the absence of a data protection law in India. Since NATGRID aims to collate data from various sources to create profiles of people to track for criminal activity, it is necessary that data protection measures be put in place to ensure that NATGRID does not violate its mandate by suffering from function creep. “Function creep” occurs when information is used for a purpose that is not the original specified purpose. In the absence of data protection measures and by being exempt from disclosures under the RTI Act, NATGRID presents the very obvious danger of becoming a tool for state-sponsored mass surveillance.\nThe prevailing legal regime regarding privacy can thus be reduced to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1) which states that any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy, which is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution, must conform to certain thresholds which include legality, necessity, proportionality and procedural safeguards.\nThe threshold of legality requires that the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. However, in response to a parliamentary question on December 17, 2013, the then Minister of State for Home Affairs R.P.N. Singh stated that the Government does not plan to issue any executive order to give a legal framework to NATGRID.\nThe threshold of procedural safeguards requires that there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. In response to a parliamentary question on March 1, 2016 the then Minister of State for Home Affairs Haribhai Parthibhai Chaudhary stated that “An Audit Committee headed by Deputy National Security Advisor has been constituted to audit the manner in which the data is accessed and sought to be used.” It is our view that such a measure is not sufficient to satisfactorily respond to the privacy concerns which may arise.\nWho will ‘watch the watchmen’? This look into NATGRID is the first in IFF’s new series called Watch the Watchmen. Through this series we aim to look into and analyse the looming surveillance technology threats in India.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/watch-the-watchmen-part-1-the-national-intelligence-grid/","summary":"We take a closer look at the proposed National Intelligence Grid which aims to tackle terror threats in the country and is scheduled go live on December 31, 2020.","title":"Watch the Watchmen Series Part 1 : The National Intelligence Grid"},{"content":"  tl;dr The Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP) 2019, which is critical for the data privacy, is being considered by a special Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). While the JPC has picked up pace in the last few weeks, the initial depositions have primarily focussed on engagement with government bodies and industry experts. We believe this needs to change and have urged the committee to invite a diverse range of stakeholders for depositions. Without it, conscious drafting choices against the interests of citizens contained in the PDP Bill run the risk of avoiding proper scrutiny. __ Today we wrote the JPC to consider widening participation and bringing a diverse range of independent voices to depose before it.\nPrioritisation over privacy A large portion of issues inherent to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, which currently lies for debate and deliberation with the specialist JPC originates from the priorities set by an Expert Committee on Data Protection. Broadly these can be placed in two buckets:\n Viewing personal data primarily as an economic resource: While many view data as an economic resource, personal data at its core \u0026ndash; as per the articulation of the Justice (Retd.) K.S. Puttaswamy Judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India \u0026ndash; is a component of the fundamental right to privacy from the perspective of legal regulation. This constitutional understanding has been de-prioritized by the Draft Data Protection Bill. There is clear language within the preamble and key legislative provisions that prefer economic exploitation over data protection. In its present form the draft law will undermine the rights of citizens in favour of data collectors and processors. Absence of surveillance reform, institutional autonomy of the Data Protection Authority (DPA), and large public sector exceptions: The expectations from data protection today are that protections under it should be enforced with strength and independence against public sector bodies and government functionaries since they collect large amounts of data. However, shared analysis by many groups and experts has shown that there has been a complete absence in engaging with the issue of surveillance reforms that can provide oversight and safeguards over mass surveillance projects. Further, the institutional design of the DPA lacks autonomy and there are large exemptions available to public authorities. This would lead to an overwhelming circumvention of data protection in favour of mass surveillance.  This is not rhetoric. We have detailed these concerns in a clause by clause analysis available on a citizen centric advocacy campaign titled #SaveOurPrivacy. It is available here. To supplement this, we had also come out with primers explaining the effect of the PDP Bill on National Population Register (NPR) and Workplace Surveillance. These public analysis documents were also part of a separate detailed submission to the JPC as part of their request for suggestions on the PDP Bill 2019.\nA little diversity never hurt nobody! These core deficiencies have existrd in the draft from the time it was suggested by the Expert Committee headed by Justice (Retd.) B.N. Srikrishna.This draft was forwarded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for introduction in the Parliament before eventually being referred to the JPC.\nThroughout the entire process diverse, independent and transparent feedback has been lacking (For eg. concerns raised by citizens to the Srikrishna Committee). We believe that a positive path can be charted with open stakeholder depositions that promote equal representation of independent academics, technologists and global experts on specific areas of data protection \u0026ndash; beside government bodies, law firms \u0026amp; those representing industry voices. A listing for this is given below.\n_So what can be done about this? _ Given the process is one that is ongoing and depositions are proceedings we believe, the JPC must expand future depositions. We have urged them to do this through a letter we wrote to it\u0026rsquo;s Chairperson Ms. Meenakshi Lekhi today. This can be by depositions by organisations and independent experts, who have proven expertise and experience in domains like privacy, civil liberties, and digital rights.\nImportant Links:  Our representation to the JPC on the PDP Bill urging for a wider civil society and citizen engagement dated.

This petition was filed by Mr. Jackson Mathew as a follow up to his previous petition filed in May 2020 after the Ministry of Home Affairs made use of Aarogya Setu mandatory for all public and private sector employees. Both petitions filed by Mr. Mathew are scheduled to be listed before a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in September 2020.\nBackground On 01 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 which made use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all public and private sector employees. The head of an organization was also made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the Aarogya Setu app among all employees. Aggreived by this, Mr. Jackson Mathew, who employs over 50 people in his paper cup manufacturing business, filed a petition before the Kerala High Court (Read more here). Soon after the petition was filed, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued revised guidelines on 17 May 2020 which encouraged use of the Aarogya Setu app on a \u0026ldquo;best efforts\u0026rdquo; basis but stopped short of making it mandatory (Read more here).\nHowever, this was only a partial victory because a few days later on 21 May 2020, the Ministry of Civil Aviation issued an order which provided conflicting guidelines about whether Aarogya Setu was mandatory for passengers who wanted to undertake domestic air travel. The confusion resulting from the conflicting guidelines led to a situation where use of the Aarogya Setu app was mandatory for all practical purposes for flight passengers (Read more here).\nPrivate Sector Access Since its launch as a proximity exposure notification app, the government has also added several new features to Aarogya Setu which raise concerns about function creep and third party data sharing. For a while, the app was used to refer users to select telemedicine and e-pharmacy services listed on the Aarogya Setu Mitr portal till this practice was discontinued after brick and mortar pharmacies filed a petition before the Delhi High Court. As media reports have explained, integration of services like telemedicine and e-pharmacies with the Aarogya Setu app creates a serious conflict of interest since many of these services are being provided by private entities whose executives were involved in the development of the app.\nThe functional aspects of the Aarogya Setu app have also been changed to facilitate sharing of data with third parties. For instance, on July 05, 2020, the app was updated with the option of granting permission to external third-party apps to access the user’s health status. Most recently, on August 22, 2020, the government launched an ‘Open API Service’ to enable employers to receive real-time information about the risk status of their employees, customers and users. While consent of the employee is required under the Open API Service, in reality, employees may not have enough bargaining power to resist imposition of the app by the management.\nFollow up Litigation before Kerala HC The second petition which raises concerns about third party data sharing and the lack of clarity about whether Aarogya Setu is voluntary or mandatory was filed on 20 August 2020. To address residual concerns associated with the Aarogya Setu app, the petition seeks two main reliefs. First, it seeks a direction restraining the government from sharing any personal data collected by the Aarogya Setu app with third parties for access to convenience services or issuance of e-pass. Second, it seeks a direction to the government to give wide publicity to the voluntary nature of Aarogya Setu through electronic, print and social media and on the app itself.\nThe petition was listed for hearing before the Kerala High Court on 24 August 2020 i.e. Monday. During the hearing, the Single Judge Bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman directed that this writ petition should be listed with other connected matters before a Division Bench. The matter is likely to be listed next after the Onam Holidays in September 2020. The petitioner was represented by Advocates Santhosh Mathew and Anil Sebastian Pulickel and we, at IFF, are grateful to have had the opportunity to assist the legal team in this case.\nImportant Documents  Writ Petition (Civil) No. 17439 of 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/kerala-hc-aarogya-setu/","summary":"On 24 August, the Kerala HC heard a writ petition regarding third party data sharing and mandatory imposition of the Aarogya Setu app.","title":"Kerala HC to hear Aarogya Setu petitions in September 2020 #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Today, 243 lawyers including senior advocates wrote to Twitter Inc. regarding its proactive censorship of Mr. Prashant Bhushan, a senior member of the bar committed to anti-corruption and human rights causes. The signatories to the joint representation have urged Twitter to reinstate Mr. Bhushan\u0026rsquo;s tweets since there is no underlying judicial direction for removal of online content and in its absence, such proactive censorship is inconsistent with Twitter’s own content moderation policy, domestic law and international best practices.\nBackground Contempt of court proceedings were initiated against Mr. Prashant Bhushan before the Supreme Court of India for posting tweets which criticized the past and present Chief Justices of India. The tweets were disabled by Twitter after the first hearing in the case on 22.07.2020 despite no judicial direction being issued by the Supreme Court for removal of the tweets till date. The webpages for these tweets now state that “This Tweet from @pbhushan1 has been withheld in IN in response to a legal demand.”\nWhile the tweets have been removed from Twitter\u0026rsquo;s platform, their content has been reproduced by the Supreme Court in its orders and by the media in several news reports. As a result, the content of these tweets has become a part of the public record and it is widely available in the public domain. In this situation, it is unclear what purpose will be served by removal of the actual tweets from Twitter\u0026rsquo;s platform except erasure of the historical record.\nStandards for Intermediary Liability We understand and appreciate that companies like Twitter must comply with local laws to continue offering their services in India. However, in the present case, established precedent of the Supreme Court of India in _Shreya Singhal v. Union of India _ shields Twitter from any liability for failing to take down content unless a court order is passed asking it to do the same. In Shreya Singhal, the Supreme Court has clearly held that an intermediary can be found liable for failing to remove content only \u0026quot; upon receiving actual knowledge that a court order has been passed asking it to expeditiously remove or disable access to certain material.\u0026quot;\nThe Manila Principles on Intermediary Liability similarly recognize that online content should not be restricted by intermediaries without an order by a judicial authority. The Manila Principles further clarify that any such court order must (i) provide a determination that the content is unlawful in the jurisdiction; (ii) indicate the Internet identifier and description of the unlawful content; (iii) provide evidence sufficient to document the legal basis of the order; and (iv) if applicable, indicate the time period for which the content should be restricted.\nFinally, Twitter\u0026rsquo;s own content moderation policy states that “if we receive a valid and properly scoped request from an authorized entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time.” In the present case, none of these criteria have been satisfied because the tweets were disabled by Twitter Inc. without any direction being issued by the Supreme Court for their removal.\nJoint Representation by Indian Lawyers The joint representation has been endorsed by 243 lawyers practicing in India, and the list of endorsees includes Senior Advocates, Mr. Dushyant Dave, Mr. Sanjay Hegde and Mr. Sanjay Parikh. The representation urges Twitter to reinstate Mr. Bhushan\u0026rsquo;s tweets since there is no underlying judicial direction for removal of content and it warns about the long term consequences of the stance adopted by Twitter in Mr. Bhushan\u0026rsquo;s case.\nSuch proactive removal of content in the absence of a court order represents a slippery slope, and by making such a concession, Twitter has given authorities precedent to demand censorship of online speech merely based on initiation of court proceedings. Taken to its logical conclusion, this could lead to a scenario where Twitter Inc. is required to disable all content with respect to which a notice or summons has been issued by a judicial authority, concerning underlying claims of infringement or defamation, even if there is no accompanying direction for content removal.\nCompanies like Twitter Inc. must adopt a consistent and principled stance before courts across different jurisdictions to insist on adherence to rights respecting legal standards available under domestic law, like the Shreya Singal precedent in Mr. Bhushan\u0026rsquo;s case. Otherwise, in the long term, proactive censorship by intermediaries will weaken existing safe harbour protections for platforms and lead to arbitrary and disproportionate censorship of internet users in the developing world.\nImportant Documents  Joint Representation to Twitter Inc. with full list of signatories (link) Covering Letter for Joint Representation (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/joint-letter-to-twitter-about-removal-of-prashant-bhushan-tweets/","summary":"Today, 243 lawyers including senior advocates wrote to Twitter Inc. seeking reinstatement of Mr. Prashant Bhushan\u0026rsquo;s tweets which became the subject of contempt of court proceedings before the Supreme Court of India.","title":"Over 240 lawyers urge Twitter to re-instate Prashant Bhushan's tweets #FreeToMeme"},{"content":"  tl;dr The Aarogya Setu app was made available for public download on April 2, 2020. Ever since its release, there have been calls to make it open source as part of the government’s Policy on Adoption of Open Source Software. More than four months on, all that the developers, and the researchers have is a source code that is not even the code of the actual app. Moreover, the server-side code, which handles most of the functions of the app remains missing and the code repository barely gets updated. In this scenario, the privacy, and security of over 150 million users remain to be at risk. So, we wrote to the government asking them to step up, and soon!\nWhat is Open Source? Red Hat, one of the world’s leading open source software developers define an open source software as ‘\u0026hellip;code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.’ Furthermore, they state that making a software open source fosters principles like transparency, flexibility, reliability as the process promotes peer review and, open collaboration. The Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology through its Policy on the Adoption of Open Source Software aims to encourage a formal adoption of the open source system by government organisations, whenever they come up with a software or a related technological service. According to the policy, the open source process ensures efficiency, transparency and reliability of such services. While it all seems good on paper, the government’s actions have been quite the opposite when it comes to Aarogya Setu.\nThe Aarogya Setu and its tryst with Open Source The Aarogya Setu App was released for public access for the first time on April 2, 2020. Not long after this launch, tech experts and media outlets from across the globe started flagging massive issues related to privacy, transparency, data minimisation, liability and accountability. In other words, early on after the release, a strong consensus had developed that the app and its deployment had glaring issues that needed swift and prudent redressal. We had detailed out these issues in our blog post dated April 14, 2020.Given these issues, it is not surprising that ever since its release, security experts, digital rights defenders and the country’s developer community have been calling for the app to go the open-source route. While there was initial resistance from the government, especially through the earlier terms of the app, which explicitly prohibited reverse-engineering even for the purpose of research, the MeitY finally decided to make the app open source through a PIB release dated 26 May 2020. To this effect, the native source code of the Android version of the app was released officially on GitHub.\nIs Aarogya Setu finally open source? Well, not really. We explain. 1. Massive delays in source code release: MeitY’s PIB release, which announced the app going the open source route, only released the Android version source code of the app. The app also has an iOS version for the Apple devices and a KaiOS version, which runs on various Nokia phones and the JioPhone. While the PIB release promised the iOS app’s source code within two weeks, it was only recently released on 10 August, 2020 after a two month deviation from the timeline. Here, there are two major problems:\n With Aarogya Setu’s user footprint increasing rapidly, any delay in releasing the source code effectively defeats the purpose of the open source process. This is because as more Indians are urged to use the app, sometimes through coercive measures, more Indians become vulnerable to the inherent privacy, and security issues of the app. Therefore, any delay in releasing the source code runs a massive risk of taking us to a point of no return, where the privacy and security of the users is irreversibly compromised. The press release does not even mention the KaiOS version of the app, which is cause of great worry as quite a sizeable number of app users on these platforms might miss out on essential fixes and enhancements that might develop through the open source collaboration. This is tantamount to putting the privacy and security of a lot of users are at a deliberate risk.  2. The released source does not match the actual app: An even bigger issue has been flagged by multiple developers and users on the GitHub page of the source code. These users have commented that the app that the source code provided on the official GitHub release does not match the actual version of the app, which is available for the users to download and use. In other words, the researchers and developers cannot contribute to the process because they have not even been given the actual code to work with! While the press release invokes the Policy on Adoption of Open Source Software and calls for collaboration with the top technical brains of the country, such a move prevents any such collaboration and is antithetical to the principles of making a venture open source. To exacerbate this further, the code repository on GitHub has not been updated since its initial release and there is a massive backlog of queries and flagged issues.\n3. The server-side code and cloud deployment functions are nowhere to be seen: Perhaps the biggest issue right now is the absence of the server-side code of the app. The Aarogya Setu app uses the WebView project to load https://web.swaraksha.gov.in/ncv19/ through the app to perform most of the app’s functions. Most of the major and the most important functions of the app, therefore, are executed and stored on the app’s server infrastructure itself and not on the device. This means that without access to the server source code and cloud deployment details not much insight can be gained about the app’s functions and data storage. Therefore, the developers and researchers keen to work on this app cannot help in making it better, more robust and more privacy-friendly.\nSo you decide, is Aarogya Setu really open-source yet?\nIFF raises concerns with the Government We have been vociferously supporting the cause of making Aarogya Setu an open source project. We, at, IFF, believe that this is absolutely necessary given that the app deals with sensitive personal information and therefore privacy, security and liberty of all its users. In such a scenario, ensuring that the bright Indian tech community is given a chance to collaborate with the government and contribute towards making the app more secure, more robust and overall, better. Therefore, we wrote to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, NITI Aayog and the National Informatics Centre to urgently take note of these pressing issues and provide quick redressal. To this effect, we also gave a few recommendations that will steer the process in the right direction:\n Expedite the release of the server-side code, cloud deployment features and KaiOS source code: The Aarogya Setu app relies on the server code for most of its functions. This means that simply releasing the device code will not give any real insight to the developers into the functioning of the app. Hence, releasing the server code, the KaiOS code, and cloud deployment features at the earliest should be the priority.  2. Resolve the issues on GitHub in real-time and engage with the queries of the developers: The first set of native app code for Aarogya Setu was released nearly three months ago. Since then, developers from across the country have been working tirelessly towards making the app more functional, more secure and overall, better. However, it is important that their queries and the issues that they flag should be dealt with in real-time or at least within an acceptable time frame. This will ensure that the young developer community of the country is further encouraged to positively contribute to government ventures, something which is extremely important to foster an environment of collaboration and innovation in the technological innovation and more particularly the cybersecurity space.\n3. Regularly update the code repository on GitHub: The mismatch between the public app version and the code available to the developers and researchers is antithetical to the whole premise of open source testing. Therefore, we would like the government to look into this matter and ensure that the GitHub code repository is up-to-date and up-to-speed with the actual app so that the open source protocol can be duly followed.\nImportant Documents:  Our representation to MeitY, NITI Aayog and NIC highlighting the loopholes in the open source process of Aarogya Setu dated August 18, 2020 [link] Is Aarogya Setu privacy-first?

It presents a journalistic investigation into the role of specific officials at Facebook India who have applied content moderation policies in a partisan manner enabling hate speech. We worry this is a larger pattern that has implications for the safety of citizens and the health of Indian democracy. Today, we wrote to the Parliamentary Committee on Information Technology for urgent steps including summons to it\u0026rsquo;s top global executives, extensive hearings and an international human rights audit leading to reparations for victims.\nPartisan enforcement on hate speech Over years accusations have often emerged from persons across the political spectrum but their impact is most often greater on persons which lack power. It is estimated that Facebook has close to 300 million users in India and is its largest global market. It has massive reach, economic and social power to cause impact. While such social networks facilitate and further the ability for users to avail their rights to free expression which is a goal to be protected, we are often confronted with harms caused by them. This requires systemic fixes and actual accountability to be fixed in a manner which is transparent, proportional and certain.\nTo us, there are two issues to be considered as per the WSJ Story. The first is the core claim made in which a specific instance of hate speech made by a politician is reported and a content review decision on it is influenced by senior staff in Facebook India. This points to worrying issues of trust not only in the content review and moderation practices but the role of individual assessments and the role played by the staff at Facebook India. We acknowledge that assessments are often contextual and subjective. Further, there may be space for genuine errors or omissions however urgent steps which must be taken to ensure trust, credibility in processes of content review. For a more detailed analysis of this, we would specifically like to draw reference to the Equality Labs : Facebook India Report 2019 (link) which has stated that, “[t]he authors warn that without urgent intervention, such hate speech is likely to be weaponized as a trigger for large-scale communal violence in India.”\nThreats to democracy The second core claim in the WSJ Story is with regard to Facebook India’s press releases on content takedowns during the 2019 general elections which display a partisan slant. We are concerned whether such practices extended to it’s content review itself. The specific event averted are content takedowns Facebook’s newsroom reported on April 1, 2019 that it undertook the removal of two separate and unrelated networks of pages, groups and accounts that engaged in “coordinated unauthentic behaviour on Facebook and Instagram” (link). As noted in the WSJ Report, there was the mention of one political party only despite a clear inference as to the source of the second network being another political party. Here, the lack of accountability and transparency by Facebook is glaring. There are no sources to corroborate the facts put out as to whether the reasons behind these takedowns are legitimate.\nAt present the response from Facebook Inc. and Facebook India has been disappointing. They have in press statements indicated that they are working on, “regular audits”, and seeking to improve their “internal processes”. These are vague, non-commitments for redressal and will lead to continuing harms to the close to 300 million users of Facebook in India. These are similar to vague responses similar to when the Cambridge Analytica case first came to light on which there has been little or no outcome. We had referred to specific interventions which need to be considered in this regard inter alia by correspondence dated February 25, 2019.\nSteps to be taken We believe that content moderation and platform governance are complex issues. They consider values of free expression and the limits to them. While awaiting the creation of institutional change and processes that advance these values as per the Constitution of India, urgent steps are required in the interim to fix accountability and prevent further harm. To take this demand forward today we wrote to the Standing Committee on Information Technology recommending that they hold a hearing within the topic of, \u0026ldquo;‘Safeguarding citizens’ data on social/online news media platforms’\u0026rdquo;.\nWe suggest the following actions that may be considered by it in its engagement with Facebook Inc. and Facebook India:\n Open a hearing with Facebook Global : Summons must be issued to senior management of Facebook Inc. which oversee the operations of Facebook India to participate in the proceedings of this Ld. Committee. Suggest a international human rights audit : Facebook Inc. must take urgent and immediate action as necessary to conduct a full human rights audit of its India operations as conducted as per the report released on July 8, 2020 (link). This process is distinct from regular audits must be established by Facebook Inc. through its global offices that are outside the influence of Facebook India to maintain the safety and trust in this process and its outcomes. Further, there must be a focus on independence, impartiality and transparency with regular updates on progress. To clarify, this full report must be made publicly available as per a similar model adopted for the report released on July 8, 2020. Reparations for victims : Facebook Inc. must consider financial reparations for victims of hate speech in India for any specific instances identified by the global audit. This must encompass physical and mental suffering. Further, since this damage is not economically quantifiable, the assessment must be made in equity. Here we would like to make reference to the practitioners guide on, “The Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Gross Human Rights Violations” published by the International Commission of Jurists in 2018 (link).

As a result, we wrote to the Director General of NIFT as well as the Ministry of Textiles asking them to recall the policy which hampers the right to freedom of speech and expression of the students.\nThe Social Media Policy, 2020 According to reports, NIFT has recently implemented a “NIFT Social Media Policy, 2020” which has two distinct parts, with the first being specific guidance and the latter a list of bulleted, “online etiquette”. We have two distinct concerns with this policy:\nA. The over-reliance and repeated emphasis given to existing criminal laws in Point no. 7 and 8 which does not serve as necessary caution but may well be perceived as a threat of prosecution. This is especially given that the practiced reality of such laws is often arbitrary - where the process itself is the punishment.\nB. Our more specific concern arises from Point no. 2 of the said policy that states, “[a]ny content maligning NIFT, its policies and employees will be viewed adversely inviting disciplinary action and inter alia, penalties, debarment from sitting the examination, campus placements etc.” We submit this condition requires removal as it violates the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), due to the following reasons:\n Vagueness in the phrasing, particularly the use of the undefined term, “maligning”, makes this restriction open to being applied arbitrarily. There is also the issue of overbreadth as such a condition in the official policy of the institute curbs valid dissent and dissatisfaction that a student or a parent may have with the institution. Overbreadth is a concept of free speech jurisprudence/legal theory which means that the term in question is so wide and vague that it is difficult to define or limit its scope. Additionally, the imposition of disciplinary action and penalties such as disbarment on those who violate the policy is disproportionate when no standards have been prescribed to distinguish how such penalties will be evaluated.  Free Speech - Always in Vogue Students today are digital natives. They use social media as a form of expression to not only engage with peers but also to vent their frustrations and raise awareness and concerns on relevant issues. We urge you to be mindful especially of the ongoing pandemic which has had an adverse effect on the students across the country. Students have been using social media to raise valid concerns pertaining to online classes and fee structures. In such a situation, this policy can be seen as a way in which the institute is trying to stifle the expression of concerns.\nThus, we recommended that the social media policy be recalled and a new version should be circulated as a draft online for comment and feedback from the student body.\nImportant Documents  Representation to Director General of the National Institute of Fashion Technology and Ministry of Textiles for the recall of NIFT\u0026rsquo;s Social Media Ban Policy dated August 14, 2020 (link) NIFT’s Social Media Policy, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/nifts-social-media-policy-2020-violates-the-right-to-freedom-of-speech-and-expression/","summary":"We wrote to the Director General of NIFT as well as the Ministry of Textiles asking them to recall the policy which hampers the right to freedom of speech and expression of the students.","title":"NIFT's Social Media Policy, 2020 violates the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression"},{"content":"  tl;dr The 2020 Parliamentary Budget Session had to be cut short 12 days ahead of schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant that a lot of time that would have been dedicated to the discussion of pressing issues was lost. Meanwhile, fresh issues, especially in the domain of digital, and privacy rights have arisen. These problems required urgent parliamentary deliberation and oversight. With the upcoming Monsoon Session offering a glimmer of hope, we urge our Parliamentarians to take note of issues in the domain of data, privacy, and digital rights. Since a truncated session might be on the cards, we identify core issues as ‘prioritization and efficiency’ will be realistically how this session may be structured.\nThe 2020 Parliamentary Monsoon Session: Lite Version? ‘Better late than never’ is the sentiment as indications emerge that the Monsoon Session of the Parliament for this year may soon be announced. While an official announcement is still awaited, various news reports over the past few weeks have claimed that parliament might commence around Late August-Early September.\nIt has been rumoured that to ensure that social distancing protocols are followed, each wing of the Parliament (the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha) might sit for business on alternate days \u0026mdash; with each wing using up halls of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to ensure safe social distancing. On the other hand, a similar scheme but with a morning and evening shift instead of alternate days has also been suggested by some sources. Given the backlog of urgent issues the second approach is a more preferable option since the former would amount to half the time for deliberation in comparison. Whatever route is taken, it is obvious that prioritisation of issues, and procedural efficiency may dominate this session. We, sincerely believe that this is possible while maintaining a healthy balance deliberative and considered debate. To aid in this effort we have identified several core digital rights issues which may benefit from parliamentary scrutiny. This is only the first step and we intend to follow this up with correspondence with the treasury and the opposition benches.\nDigital, and Privacy Rights: Important Issues and the Way Forward A lot of developments, which have a direct bearing on every Indian citizen’s digital, data, and privacy rights have shaped up over the past few months. Website blocking, blanket app bans, deployment of intrusive surveillance technologies and continued internet shutdowns are just a few of these issues. Our team has been on its toes to make sure that citizens’ rights are duly respected and protected. To this effect, we have consistently engaged with various government ministries, legislators, civil society organisations, parliamentary committees, and the citizens themselves to vociferously advocate for a more inclusive, and rights-respecting digital ecosystem.\nAs an organisation that works closely with issues pertaining to digital rights, transparency, innovation, privacy protection, and civil liberties, we have consistently engaged with governmental bodies to brief them about core issues that seek immediate and foolproof redressal. From time to time, we have also come up with and advocated for policy recommendations for these issues. The following table lists the broad issues that we reckon are of utmost importance for discussion in the upcoming parliamentary session along with some broad policy recommendations that should be deliberated upon.\nJanta Parliament Initiative We definitely realise that legislative deliberation through the various activities of the Parliament is one of the most vital parts of governance and policy making in the country. Therefore, it gives us immense pleasure to be a part of the Janta Parliament initiative where more than 50 civil society organisations and citizens’ campaigns will come together for a 6-day simulated conference to convene a unique citizen driven Parliament. We have contributed to this initiative through substantive inputs towards the summary demands for analysis, demands and recommendations. This is a coordinated effort at setting out a concrete, well-researched and pragmatic agenda to address urgent COVID-19 related policy issues whenever the next parliamentary session takes place. To start off, Janta Parliament is going to hold a press briefing at 1430 hours today (13th August 2020). Therefore, we urge all media organisations to attend and be part of this unique and much needed initiative. In conclusion, we really hope that this Independence Day our parliamentarians pledge to make the best use of the parliament to discuss and resolve urgent issues from all sectors including digital rights, and privacy during the upcoming session. This is very important because legislators are our first line of defence against breaches of rights and their diligence is essential to deepening the sense of democracy in the country. We also hope that consensus can be reached on the arrangements and starting date of the monsoon session without any further delay, and that instead of a truncated session, a fully functional and efficient session can be held.\nImportant Links:   You can read more on Jan Sarokar’s Janta Parliament initiative, and participation here.

This has been stated in Union of India\u0026rsquo;s additional affidavit filed last night and also confirmed by the Attorney General during today\u0026rsquo;s hearing before the Supreme Court in Foundation for Media Professional\u0026rsquo;s contempt petition relating to the internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which recently crossed one year. While the contempt petition has been disposed off, the government has been directed to file a reply regarding non-publication of orders in review and lack of periodic review every five/seven working days.\nBackground On 11 May 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement in a petition filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) seeking restoration of 4G mobile internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic (Read more here). The Court constituted a Special Committee comprising (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, (ii) Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, and (iii) Chief Secretary, Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to immediately review the 4G mobile internet ban. In particular, the Special Committee was directed to examine the material placed on record by all parties and consider the viability of less restrictive alternatives suggested by the petitioner.\nSince there was no information available in the public domain about the functioning of the Special Committee, FMP was constrained to file a contempt petition before the Supreme Court again on 09 June 2020. During the course of hearings in the contempt petition, the government revealed that the Special Committee had held two meetings since its constitution on 15 May 2020 and 10 June 2020, and it decided to defer the issue for two months since the security situation was allegedly not conducive to relaxation of internet restrictions (Read more here).\nAdditional Affidavit filed by UoI The contempt petition was scheduled for substantive oral arguments today i.e. 11 August 2020 but the Union Government filed an additional affidavit last night which agreed to restoration of 4G mobile internet services in one district of Jammu and Kashmir each on a trial basis after 15 August i.e. Independence Day.\nIn its additional affidavit, the government has stated that the Special Committee held its third meeting on 10 August 2020 where it found that the threat perception in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir continues to be high and that internet speed restrictions did not have any impact on COVID-19 control measures, education or business. However, the Special Committee has decided that 4G mobile internet may be restored in select low risk areas in the below mentioned manner.\n  \u0026ldquo;Decision of the Special Committee\u0026rdquo;\n  What happened during today\u0026rsquo;s hearing? Since the Union Government had agreed to restore 4G mobile internet in select districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on a trial basis, much of today\u0026rsquo;s hearing focused on how this process would be made transparent and accountable.\nMr. Huzefa Ahmadi, Senior Advocate appearing for FMP argued that the government had not complied with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India because it had failed to publish any orders in review issued by the State Level Review Committee or the Special Committee. He further submitted that the changing circumstances must be reviewed every five/seven working days in compliance with Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India. Since these concerns remained unresolved, he insisted that while the contempt petition may be disposed, the interlocutory application for directions should remain pending and the government should file a reply to it.\nThe Attorney General, Mr. K.K. Venugopal responded to these arguments by stating that all relevant orders had been published on the Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir\u0026rsquo;s website. He undertook to file a reply to the interlocutory application responding to the petitioner\u0026rsquo;s contentions about non-publication of orders in review and lack of periodic review every five working days. The Court has granted the government two weeks to file its reply to the interlocutory application and it has disposed off the contempt petition in light of the government\u0026rsquo;s assurance regarding staggered restoration of 4G internet.\nThe matter is likely to be listed next after at least two weeks and we will keep you updated. FMP was represented in today\u0026rsquo;s proceedings by a legal team led by Senior Advocate, Huzefa Ahmadi and consisting of Advocates Shadan Farasat and Bharat Gupta and IFF associated counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Apar Gupta, and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay.\nImportant Documents  Additional Affidavit filed by Union of India (link) Written Submissions filed by FMP (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/staggered-4g-restoration-j-k/","summary":"During today\u0026rsquo;s hearing in Foundation for Media Professionals' contempt petition relating to the internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir, the government agreed to restore 4G mobile internet in one district of Jammu and Kashmir each on a trial basis after 15 August i.e. Independence Day.","title":"Govt agrees to staggered restoration of 4G mobile internet  in J\u0026K before the Supreme Court #KeepUsOnline"},{"content":"  tl;dr On August 10, 2020 our Prime Minister inaugurated the Chennai and Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project.

Further urgent policy reforms are necessary on the issue of Internet Shutdowns, especially for regions such as Jammu and Kashmir.\nFirstly, thank you\u0026hellip; The issue of the lack of access to fast and affordable internet in Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands was brought to our notice in June, 2020. Subsequently, we took multiple steps to aid the people of the islands by writing to the PMO, DoT and to the Honourable Member of Parliament for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Shri Kuldeep Rai Sharma.\nIn our representations, we highlighted the difficulties being faced by the people of the islands and requested that the CANI Project be operationalised at the earliest so that some of these difficulties can be eased. Yesterday, on August 10, 2020, the stalled project received a boost with an inauguration by the Prime Minister. We are hopeful that the people of the islands will soon be free of the difficulties which they expressed to us and are committed to ensure its actual execution.\nNext? #4GforAll ? We are now also planning on bringing greater attention to other parts of India which suffer from the absence of network infrastructure forcing their residents to be deprived of 4G connectivity. One such incident which we came across recently was BSNL switching off 4G internet in 17 low data sites in Odisha\u0026rsquo;s Kalahandi, Nuapada and Balangir due to underutilization of ZTE 4G equipment commissioned in the areas.\nIn a reply to a question in Lok Sabha, Sanjay Dhotre, MoS for Communications, Human Resource Development and Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology said that, “In 27,721 villages of India, there are still no mobile connections due to various issues”. Odisha trails the most with 6,549 villages without any mobile network. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh follow Odisha with 2000-3000 villages without any mobile network. This sets back our fellow Indians, from the benefit of fast and affordable 4G internet.\nTo ensure that the Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s Office takes notice of this issue, we with a letter of appreciation also undertook to provide regular inputs on many of these underserved areas. Our letter also highlights the tremendous inequity and the harm to human development due to the lack of reforms in our Internet Shutdown laws.

Serious concerns have been raised about the composition and functioning of the Committee but the consultation process is still being carried out. In this explainer, we focus on speech based offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which apply over the internet and require reform including sedition, hate speech, defamation, obscenity and fake news.\nBackground A five member Committee has been established by the Ministry of Home Affairs to recommend reforms to Indian criminal law. The Committee is headed by Prof. Ranbir Singh (Vice Chancellor, NLU Delhi) and its members include Prof. G. S. Bajpai (Registrar, NLU Delhi), Prof. Balraj Chauhan (Vice Chancellor, DNLU Jabalpur), Mr. Mahesh Jethmalani (Senior Advocate) and Mr. G. P. Thareja (Former District and Sessions Judge, Delhi).\nThere is lack of transparency about the terms of reference for the Committee and whether its report will be prepared independently of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Committee has also come under heavy criticism for lacking regional diversity and representation of women, dalits, adivasis, religious minorities, LGBTQIA+ persons and other marginalized identities. Further, civil society groups have warned against overhauling the country’s criminal justice system in the middle of a pandemic which has disrupted the functioning of the parliament and judiciary and taken away the public’s ability to organize protests.\nTo learn more about problems with the Committee’s composition, methodology, timelines and functioning, check out this helpful Twitter thread which curates commentary around the criminal law amendment process.\nDetails about the Consultation Methodology\nInitially, the consultation was going to be conducted through fixed questionnaires with stringent word limits. This approach was criticized for being too rigid and for giving the impression that the Committee had pre-determined which amendments were required. As this wryly brilliant piece by Abhinav Sekhri notes, it is “difficult to not be left feeling that the questionnaire and its overarching undefined consultation process had reduced the task of reforming criminal law to the banality of customer satisfaction forms asking for my opinion on the quality of service.”\nTo partially address these concerns, the Committee has stated that it intends to conduct an open consultation in addition to the fixed questionnaires and it has removed the 200 word limit for the questionnaires. The open consultation gives people the option to send their views, suggestions and comments on any issue which relates to the Committee\u0026rsquo;s mandate.\nTimeline\nThe deadlines for the consultation are unusually short considering the scale of the exercise and the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. As this Article 14 report notes, the Malimath Committee which was established in 2000 for similar purposes took over 2.5 years to submit its report. In comparison, the present Committee has been directed by the Ministry of Home Affairs to submit its report within six months. As a consequence, individuals and organizations have been provided very little time to send their submissions. The open consultation process is open till 16 September 2020. The questionnaire based consultation has been split into six tranches and it will conclude on 09 October 2020.\n  Impact of Criminal Law on Digital Rights The Indian Penal Code, 1860 contains several speech based offences including sedition, hate speech, defamation, obscenity and public mischief which can be committed over electronic mediums as well. In addition to this, the Information Technology Act, 2000 contains specific computer related offences. Through its judgments in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015 5 SCC 1), K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1) and Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India (2020 SCC Online SC 25), the Supreme Court has recognized that the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and privacy extend to activities of individuals on the internet. Certain “reasonable restrictions” can be imposed on the exercise of these fundamental rights but such restrictions must satisfy the proportionality standard.\nViewed through the lens of the proportionality standard, any amendments to the IPC or IT Act must align with the requirements of legality, legitimacy and necessity. If these requirements are not satisfied, the amendments proposed by the Committee could lead to arbitrary prosecutions of internet users and have a chilling effect on online speech in general.\n Legality: The legal provision must be clear, precise and accessible. Many existing provisions do not satisfy this requirement because they prohibit speech on vague and overbroad grounds. For instance, even though the scope of sedition was read down by the Supreme Court in Kedarnath v. State of Bihar (AIR 1962 SC 955), the plain text of Section 124A of the IPC still contains vague phrases like ‘hatred’, ‘contempt’ and ‘disaffection’ which has enabled continued misuse of the provision. Legitimacy: The legal provision must pursue a legitimate goal. In this context, what is considered a legitimate goal must be understood from the perspective of a 21st century democracy. Many existing obscenity related provisions will not satisfy this requirement because they prohibit speech based on outdated notions of victorian morality even if there is no violation of consent or harm caused. Necessity: The legal provision must adopt the least restrictive tool available to achieve its goal. In this regard, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression’s 2011 Report has found that imprisonment as a punishment for seeking, receiving and imparting information and ideas can rarely be justified as a proportionate measure under Article 19 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights.  Speech Based Offences The first two questionnaires for substantive criminal law have been published and they contain several questions relating to sedition, hate speech, defamation, obscenity and fake news. Here, we will outline key concerns relating to these speech based offences which must be considered by the Committee.\nSedition (Section 124A, IPC)\nThe offence of sedition under Section 124A is an archaic relic and it must be completely repealed. Narrowing down the scope of the offence or introducing procedural safeguards would not be enough to prevent abuse of Section 124A. This has been demonstrated by continued misuse of Section 124A despite the judgement in Kedarnath v. State of Bihar, where the Supreme Court tried to limit the scope of sedition to acts which have a “tendency to disrupt public order.” In any case, the standard adopted in Kedarnath v. State of Bihar is outdated and the appropriate standard in the contemporary context would be prohibiting acts which incite imminent violence.\nFor more information, check out:\n IFF’s submission to the Law Commission of India on scrapping sedition. Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information  Hate Speech (Sections 153A, 153B \u0026amp; 295A, IPC)\nThe Rabat Plan of Action developed by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2013 recommends criminalization of hate speech based on a six part enquiry about (a) social and political context which existed at the time the speech was made, (b) speaker’s position and status in society, (c) intent of the speaker, (d) content and form of the speech, (e) reach of the speech act including the size of its audience and mode of dissemination, and (f) likelihood and imminence of harm. The existing hate speech provisions under the IPC must be amended and rationalized to incorporate the above mentioned elements.\nFor more information, check out:\n IFF’s representation to the Delhi Committee for Peace and Harmony Centre for Communication Governance’s comprehensive report on hate speech laws in India  Defamation (Sections 499 \u0026amp; 500, IPC)\nThe offence of defamation must be decriminalized since it is essentially a private wrong and imprisonment is a disproportionate punishment since alternative remedies are available under civil law. Criminalization of defamation has a chilling effect on free speech in online spaces and it can be weaponized to initiate Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation. We have most recently witnessed this in the context of criminal defamation charges being filed against women who spoke out during the #MeToo movement.\nFor more information, check out:\n The Protection of Reputation and Speech Bill at SpeechBill.in Gautam Bhatia’s analysis of the Supreme Court judgement upholding constitutionality of criminal defamation  Obscenity (Sections 292, 293 \u0026amp; 294, IPC)\nIndia’s obscenity laws are out of touch with the modern world and are long overdue for reform. The amendments made to these provisions should shift focus from patriarchal notions of morality to give primacy to consent and harm. Specific acts such as non-consensual sharing of intimate images and sharing of child sexual abuse material should be prohibited because they violate consent and cause harm to the individuals depicted.\nFor more information, check out:\n IFF’s submission to the Parliamentary Committee on impact of pornography IFF’s representation on non consenusal image based sexual abuse.  Public Mischief and Fake News (Section 505, IPC)\nIn its questionnaire, the Committee has sought inputs on whether fake news should be included within the scope of public mischief under Section 505, IPC. Any restriction on online speech must relate to grounds mentioned under Article 19(2) of the Constitution which include sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. Therefore, the amendments can criminalize spreading of misinformation through electronic mediums only if such an act has a proximate relation with one of the protected interests mentioned under Article 19(2). In such circumstances, whether the information is true or false is irrelevant and the underlying interest sought to be protected by criminalizing fake news spread over the internet can be served better through narrowly tailored provisions prohibiting incitement of violence and hate speech.\nFor more information, check out:\n Vasudev Devadavasan’s analysis of fake news under the Indian Constitution IFF\u0026rsquo;s representation on the standards for liability for misinformation for group administrators on Whatsapp  Important Links  Website of the Committee for Criminal Law Reforms (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/criminal-law-amendment-committee/","summary":"The Ministry of Home Affairs has established a Committee to recommend changes to Indian criminal law within six months.

Our main recommendation was to constitute a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge to create a draft Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for police departments across Maharashtra for any criminal cases based on studying judicial precedent.\nMaharashtra has set a worrying trend The State of Maharashtra, especially the city of Mumbai is the centre of the Indian entertainment industry and the cultural captial of India. This has led to enormous cultural and economic benefits for all of us across India and the world. However, a worrying trend has emerged where individuals are being arbitrarily targeted for online speech. This not only curbs their freedom of speech but also has a chilling effect on their creative expression which is the bedrock of any creative industry.\nThis trend extends across the political spectrum and while individual instances are distinguished on facts and severity, it can be seen specifically in two instances which occurred in the last month:\n  Stand-up comics have been threatened with legal prosecution for jokes or statements of anguish around public development projects such as those emerging from statements attributed to the comic artist Agrima Joshua as reported in the Hindustan Times on July 13, 2020.\n  When a social media user, namely Sameet Thakkar reportedly tweeted, “Baby Penguin” to direct humour towards the Shri Aditya Thackeray, Hon’ble Cabinet Minister of Tourism and Environment, he was booked under provisions of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code. This has been reported in The Wire on July 16, 2020.\n  To be clear, these instances are not wholly novel. There have been prosecutions of social media users, or threats of arbitrary legal action in the past. For instance, social media user Ajay Hatewar was prosecuted in 2015 for tweeting a picture of the Chief Minister at that time on a Yacht. While such actions may be insensitive, they are clearly not illegal and threats of prosecution often emerge from an incorrect application of penal provisions. These are quite often at variance with established precedents of the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay and the Supreme Court of India.\nOur recommendation: Follow existing judicial precedent to avoid arbitrariness in prosecution As an actionable measure, we suggest the constitution of a committee to create a draft Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for police departments across Maharashtra for any criminal cases based on studying judicial precedent. Our recommendations on this include:\n This committee may be headed by a retired Supreme Court Judge who can adapt the precedent that we have laid down above into the SOP. The committee should also consist of members from the legal profession, digital rights organisations, academics on free speech as well as representatives. There may be added benefits in housing this exercise in prestigious Maharashtra based legal institutions such as Government Law College, Mumbai who can provide support and assistance to the committee. The committee should aim to create a draft SOP which reduces the prevailing arbitrariness when it comes to criminal prosecution for online speech and prescribing uniform standards which may provide adequate notice to social media users and police departments. A draft of this SOP may be put to public consultation and then be made publicly available on finalisation.  Why is this necessary to be done now? In the past, we have written to the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra Home Department for a Social Media Regulation which we addressed through a Representation bearing reference number IFF/2020/137. Such actions not only are violative of the fundamental rights of residents within Maharashtra and Mumbai, but also deeply counterproductive. They threaten creativity and the productive values of thought, expression and creativity as being promoted by the State Government. It will over time cause a massive chilling effect and also have economic impacts.\nThese actions in recent times have become more concerning for two clear reasons for which a break from the past in terms of such arbitrary prosecution is necessary. First, Maharashtra has one of the highest numbers of tele connectivity and internet access across India (106 connections per 100 people as per TRAI data dated April, 2020). This means many people are active users of social media and they are at risk of prosecution. Second, many such users lack actual notice or legal literacy to understand the expanse of their fundamental right to free expression and the threshold of reasonable restrictions. This more often applies to complainants who approach police departments urging them to initiate criminal proceedings.\nThus, it is important that arbitrariness in terms of criminal prosecution for online speech be curbed. This can only be done by following existing legal precedents and creating a SOP which can be followed during such prosecutions as suggested in our recommendations above. It will help reduce frivlous complaints that threaten social media creators, activists and the large number of social media users in Maharashtra.\nImportant Documents  Representation to Hon\u0026rsquo;ble CM and Maharashtra Home Department on Online Speech dated August 6, 2020 (link) We wrote to the Mumbai Police asking them to review and amend their Social Media Regulation Order issued under S.144, CrPC dated June 4, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/we-wrote-the-maharashtra-govt-on-the-ongoing-arbitrary-criminal-prosecutions-for-online-speech-righttomeme/","summary":"We wrote to the Hon’ble Chief Minister and Home Minister of the Government of Maharashtra worried by a series of criminal prosecutions against social media users which created a chilling effect on their right to freedom of speech and expression.","title":"We urge the Maharashtra Government to formulate objective standards to protect social media users from bullying! #RighttoMeme"},{"content":"  Today marks the one year anniversary of the communication shutdown which was imposed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 05 August 2019. We immediately sensed the scale of the deprivation and issued a statement on 06 August 2019 committing to take all steps necessary to protect fundamental rights. What began then as a complete blackout of all communication services including phone calls, SMS and landline services has now morphed into an internet slowdown, with people in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir being denied access to 4G mobile internet services during a public health crisis.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has emerged as a lifeline as the functioning of hospitals, schools, offices, shops and courts has been disrupted to ensure social distancing. With most physical establishments closed, we are all heavily dependent on the internet to access telemedicine, online education, work from home, e-commerce, and virtual court hearings. However, for the vast majority of people in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir, these facilities are out of reach due to slow internet speed.\nIn the past one year, there have been multiple rounds of litigation before the Supreme Court of India regarding the constitutionality of the restrictions on internet access in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. While the Supreme Court has endorsed progressive principles of necessity and proportionality in its judgements (Anuradha Bhasin v. UoI and Foundation for Media Professionals v. U.T. of J\u0026amp;K), this has unfortunately not been accompanied by grant of any effective relief. As a consequence, despite the highest court of the land categorically holding that internet restrictions cannot become a permanent state of affairs, the people of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have been denied access to the internet on a free and equal basis with citizens from other parts of India for over one year.\nWe, at IFF, have tried our best to support court-centered advocacy against internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. This has been specifically done through IFF counsels working with diverse team of lawyers and led by brilliant senior advocates to represent the Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union. We remain fully committed to this cause despite the slow and incremental nature of change. At present, a contempt petition is pending and awaits adjudication.\nSuch court centered advocacy has been accompanied with broader policy engagement and encouragement for systemic fixes to the underlying legal provisions that flow from the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. We have specifically tried to engage with parliamentarians on this issue, and we even wrote to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology yesterday night seeking review of the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. IFF has also made representations to various ministries of the Central Government and the Special Committee and urged for immediate restoration. We recognise the outcomes have been slow and sense a level of frustration, but we are committed to preserve in our defence of fundamental rights for all people in India.\nThe government has sought to justify the restrictions on internet access in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir by citing national security concerns. However, we respectfully disagree with the government’s rationale because internet shutdowns are counterproductive - both in the short term and the long term - if the goal is to create a peaceful and stable society. In the short term, empirical studies suggest that internet shutdowns actually lead to an increase in violence because they incentivise those forms of violent collective action which require less communication and coordination than peaceful demonstrations. In the long term, internet shutdowns can lead to resentment and alienation among the local population because people feel they are being deprived of their fundamental rights.\nAccording to the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the economy of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir has suffered over Rs. 40,000 crores of losses since the communication shutdown was first imposed on 05 August 2019. The losses may be even larger as per more recent estimates. As devastatingly high as this figures may be, the true human cost of the prolonged internet restrictions is much higher and impossible to quantify. During this difficult period, the people of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have demonstrated remarkable resilience but no citizen of a 21st century democracy should have to experience such hardships in the first place.\nWe, the people of India, deserve better. And this is why we must not give in to despair and persevere against all odds to ensure that 4G internet access is restored in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and demand reform of the underlying legal framework which empowers the government to use an inherently disproportionate tool like internet shutdowns. Yesterday, it is with this hope that we wrote to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology to urgently examine this issue, as much as we separately prepare to put forward arguments before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.\nWe will not fail, for failing to try. We will give our best. We will perserve.\nImportant Links  Representation to the Standing Committee on IT dated August 04, 2020 (link) Statement on August 06, 2019 (link) Anuradha Bhasin v.

According to a senior government official and other sources in the government, the GoI is planning to come out with guidelines, flouting which any app can be banned. Such wide scale banning would undermine nuanced policy approaches for protecting the digital rights of the citizens. We have some alternatives and suggestions to protect users, innovation and the larger national interest. So, we wrote to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) urging them to develop a transparent cybersecurity policy, and asking them to expedite the work on the Personal Data Protection Bill.\nProposed guidelines on the banning of mobile applications and websites In this Economic Times article dated July 27, a senior government official has reportedly stated that the government is currently working on a protocol, which shall define expectations and rules to be fulfilled by all mobile applications. Failure to comply may lead to the application being banned by the government. However, the framework through which these proposed guidelines will be enforced remains unclear. It has been suggested that various ministries including the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Home Affairs shall be part of the consultative process, which will form these guidelines or rules.\nIFF’s View In a statement published on July 1, 2020 on the banning of 59 mobile applications we asked for transparency in the process through which these applications had been banned. This is in line with our consistent view regarding the government’s operational practice much more widely when the powers under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 are utilised.\nWe further pointed out that such blanket bans would undermine the digital rights of Indian citizens and set a worrying precedent. These bans are in deviation from the current rule of law framework under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the decisions of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India.\nWe firmly believe that such bans stifle innovation and are harmful to the growing technological ecosystem of the country. While innovators should be assured that the government supports them through a stable and reliable system, strengthening this ‘ban regime’ by legitimising it through official guidelines will hurt the interests of the public at large. Recently, India has seen opaque and arbitrary acts of censorship where websites like DuckDuckGo and WeTransfer and websites dedicated to environmental awareness and activism like FridaysForFuture and LetIndiaBreathe were blocked. A ban regime may further contribute to this ongoing arbitrary practice and thus should not be introduced.\nWhat should be done instead? In our letter dated 31 July 2020, we wrote to MeitY suggesting that instead of formalising a ban regime, the government should direct its efforts towards both coming up with progressive reforms, and expediting important policy processes for the forumulation of insitutional frameworks of enforcement.\nTo this effect, we made 4 broad recommendations :\n Advancing the National Cyber Security Policy: We suggested a rights-centred, effective and evidence based approach towards the National Cyber Security Policy that puts India’s interests first. All penalties under it from the life cycle of investments towards operations in emerging and foundational sectors such as technology are the need of the hour. We also suggested that the ongoing process for the formulation of the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2020 under which the draft recommendations must be accelerated towards finalisation but first put through another round of expert and public consultation. Focus on the Data Protection Bill and the Competition Act: Furthermore, we emphasised the need for a well-drafted Personal Data Protection Bill, which can safeguard the privacy of personal data of citizens through clear standards and evidence. While we understand that the draft bill currently lies with a Joint Parliamentary Committee(JPC) for scrutiny, steps can be taken by MeitY to expedite the process by coordinated effort with the JPC by providing written context and explanations on key legislative choices. Considering inter-ministerial inputs on Competition Law: Further there are ongoing processes by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to examine amendments to the Competition Act in which inputs on data side harms are also being considered. Here, inter-ministerial inputs may be of immense value. This is due to repeated allegations and instances of the abuse of market power and unfair trade practices by technology companies which sometimes if left unaddressed lead to grievances which then lead to demands for ad-hoc actions such as bans. Adoption of graded penalties: We also recommended that instead of placing blanket bans on applications which fail to meet the standards set by the NCSS and PDP Bill, the government should adopt a system of graded penalties wherein defaulters can be penalized monetarily and through requisite changes in operational practices in situations of non-compliance. This penalty should be accompanied with a framework which ensures that the defaulter makes an effort to comply with the standards set by the government, failing which further penalties may even be escalated in exceptional circumstances towards complete prohibitions which are term limited, or on repeated violations may even be perpetual. We intend to follow up and will keep urging all our government institutions to take clear steps to protect your digital rights.

Given our increased interaction and the near assimilation of our mind with such devices – laws governing access to PEDs by the police/law enforcement agencies (LEAs) demand scrutiny.\nLegal Blueprint The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Cr.P.C.) provides the manner in which the police and judicial authorities employ powers of search and seizure during a criminal investigation.\nStep 1- Seizure\nThe law broadly empowers -\n The police and judicial authorities to compel a person to produce a PED if it is deemed essential to an investigation; The judicial authorities can issue a search warrant (either general or specific) ifi. a person is not complying with the directions under (a);ii. the person in possession of the PED is unknown; andiii. to further an investigation. Currently, the Cr.P.C provides for issuance of a warrant to search a place. However, these are limited to physical spaces like a house, building, tent vessel, etc. There is no provision with respect to accessing a PED as a whole or any specific information/applications on it. A police officer can conduct a physical search of a person to seize a PED without a warrant, but afterwards must record his reasons in writing. A police officer can seize property (PED) either under the suspicion of being stolen or found in circumstances which creates suspicion regarding committing of an offence.  Thus, within the broad structure of its investigating powers, it seems the police have the power to seize PEDs.\nStep 2 – Search\nHowever, as opposed to most physical objects- the seizure of a PED is ineffective unless it can be searched or accessed. The seizure is only the first step- the owner must unlock a device and/or grant police access to the information stored on it. Hence, the statutory framework provides power to the police to seize PEDs, but lacks force in terms of compelling a person to unlock/ allow access to their PEDs.\nIn practice, a person may refuse to grant the police access to their PEDs and approach a judicial authority to seek an appropriate legal remedy. However, depending upon the scenario, the judicial authority could–\n Agree with a person’s refusal to grant the police access to their PEDs; Disagree with a person’s refusal to grant the police access to their PEDs and grant limited and/or complete access to their PEDs; Limit the police’s access of a person’s PED to a particular application and/or information on the device. Eg. The police can view WhatsApp communications with person(s) potentially relevant to an investigation, but not family members and friends.  Extent of police powers In practice, the police while examining a person during an investigation will ask for access (read passwords) to their PEDs. By law, a person is required to answer questions truthfully during an investigation. A failure to do so, may itself maybe a criminal offence.\nHowever, providing information in order to aid an investigation must be prudently balanced with respect to the constitutionally guaranteed right against self-incrimination. A person may refuse to provide information which is potentially self-incriminating, provide password(s) to PEDs which may point to ownership and/or control or knowledge of its contents. In such a scenario, a person may consider refusing to provide such information and subsequently seek an appropriate legal remedy to protect their right against self-incrimination.\nA notice maybe given to a person by the police requiring their physical appearance. This is another tool used to seek access to PEDs in the garb of cooperation for the purposes of an investigation.\nAs stated earlier, people and PEDs have an inalienable bond and these devices contain a range of personal information. Consequently, compelling a person to provide access is a breach of the Right to Privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution. Unless, the police can satisfy the following conditions-\n the direction to compel the disclosure must have a clear legal basis; the infringement must be necessary i.e. there should be no less restrictive alternatives available; the infringement must be proportionate i.e. it should not cause disproportionate harm to the rights holder; and the infringement should have a legitimate aim.  Consequently, if the police are unable to satisfy these four criteria- access to the PED is illegal.\nIssues to consider Giving access to a PED is akin to allowing the police to search your house. However, providing the house keys doesn’t necessarily imply they have access to your personal documents, the family jewels in your parent’s safe or have the right to peep over your garden fence and into your neighbour’s home.\nFollowing are certain limitations to the police powers of search and seizure.\nA PED may require one password to access, but several other passwords could be necessary to unlock applications/software within it. Thus, raising certain vital questions-\n What is the definition of access to a PED under Cr.P.C? What is the scope of the access – is it specific, limited and/or complete? What is the nature of the access- is it limited to information sought as per a warrant, is it only a person’s personal information, general information or anonymised information? Does access to a person’s PED mean the police can also gather a third person’s personal information (without their consent) from the device or from an application on it? Are there limits to which a person can consent to granting the police access to a PED or does consent qualify as absolute?  The Social Network conundrum Searching or accessing a device is different from a physical space. In theory, if access is granted to a PED- it will be unlimited, unless categorically restricted. This gives rise to a precarious situation where searching a PED provides disproportionate access to a person’s social networking accounts (Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and other information which may or may not be relevant for the police investigation.\nThe key issue here is - accessing a social networking application on a PED is a single point within a larger network. Hence, the police are now accessing personal information of several persons who have not consented to part with it or may not have any co-relation to an investigation.\nArguably, the purpose of accessing a PED is to extract as much information to aid an investigation. However, even as a justifiable corollary -the power to search by its very nature is limited to the person whose PED is being accessed.\nReality check!   Any person is likely to buckle under pressure from the police and simply give up their passwords to their PEDs, social media accounts, etc. Now that you have read this explainer, hopefully you are better informed to handle the situation.\nLawyers are still not allowed to be physically present during questioning by the police. However, a lawyer can accompany a person and observe the questioning, but cannot assist him in answering any questions.\nA person cannot record the event when they are being questioned by the police. The only version of the interaction officially reported is the one by the police officer. Thus, there is usually a slim chance to negate the evidence obtained by means which are strictly not in accordance with law.\nConclusion An investigation can lead to many delicate situations where- either a person feels their rights are violated or the police allege non-cooperation. Balancing the rights of persons vis-à-vis allowing the police to conduct investigations in various scenarios cannot be solved by applying uniform solutions. Hence, the rights and duties of both sides must strike a balance for a harmonious outcome within the confines of the law.\n(This explainer has been authored by Advocate Amrit Grewal who generously volunteered his time for this.)\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/search-seizure-personal-electronic-device/","summary":"This explainer is to help the reader navigate a situation where the police seize and intend to/or demand access to your personal electronic device (PED) such as a mobile phone, laptop, tablet, etc.","title":"Explainer: Law enforcement access to personal electronic devices #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Today, 135 individuals including a large number of lawyers and 7 organizations sent a representation to the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and various District \u0026amp; Sessions Judges against Aarogya Setu being mandatory for accessing Delhi District Courts. The representation highlights that such a requirement is likely to create barriers to justice, compromise the privacy of lawyers and their clients, and it has no basis in law.\nBackground After a prolonged period of disrupted functioning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical filings have recently resumed in courts in Delhi. Different district courts have issued guidelines for this purpose which seek to prevent the spread of the virus within the court premises through measures such as wearing of masks and avoiding crowding. However, the Protocol issued for the South and South East District also mandates use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app by any lawyers, clerks or litigants who wish to enter the court premises.\nThe Aarogya Setu app has been the subject of significant controversy, and concerns have been raised about the privacy and security of sensitive personal data collected by the app about a user\u0026rsquo;s health and location. These objections also prompted the Ministry of Home Affairs to backtrack on its decision to make Aarogya Setu mandatory (read more here) and its most recent Unlock 3.0. Guidelines clarify that use of Aarogya Setu is only required on a best efforts basis.\nToday i.e. 30 July 2020, 135 individuals including a large number of lawyers and 7 organizations sent a representation to the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and various District \u0026amp; Sessions Judges against Aarogya Setu being mandatory for accessing courts in Delhi. The representation highlights that such a requirement is likely to create barriers to justice, compromise the privacy of lawyers and their clients, and it has no basis in law. We are extremely grateful to Mansi Sood who brought this important issue to our notice, drafted the representation and steered this entire effort.\nConcerns about Exclusion \u0026amp; Privacy Even in urban centres like Delhi, only 30-50% of the residents own Bluetooth compatible smartphones. As a result, making the Aarogya Setu mobile app a pre-condition for entry into court complexes will exclude a significant number of advocates, clerks and litigants (especially those who visit legal aid centers). Many lawyers are struggling to make ends meet due to disrupted functioning of courts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and forcing them to purchase a smartphone will only increase their suffering.\nMandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu in judicial establishments could also undermine attorney-client confidentiality. Aarogya Setu collects sensitive personal data including the location of persons and the potential for misuse of such data compromises this basic principle that forms the bedrock of the legal profession. Further, as per the Terms of Use of the app, such data is shared with unspecified government entities and third parties. In the absence of an adequate data protection framework in place, mandating the use of this application within court complexes greatly undermines the privacy and data security of all persons within these premises.\nIn light of these concerns, the representation recommends that the following measures to be undertaken:\n Convene a meeting of all District Judges for a standardised SOP which recognises the challenges and concerns in the use of Aarogya Setu for court complexes. Recognise the concerns associated with Aarogya Setu and issue an advisory clarifying that use of the app should not be made mandatory for any physical filing or securing entry into any judicial or court complexes in Delhi, including all District Courts as well as the Delhi High Court. Ensure strict implementation of methods of risk mitigation outlined by the Ministry of Home Affairs, including but not limited to social distancing, face covering and regular sanitisation, within judicial/court complexes.

The matter is next listed on 07 August 2020. Yesterday, FMP filed its rejoinder to the Union Government\u0026rsquo;s counter-affidavit and sought transparency in the functioning of the Special Committee.\nBackground On 11 May 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement in a petition filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) seeking restoration of 4G mobile internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic (Read more here). The Court constituted a Special Committee comprising (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, (ii) Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, and (iii) Chief Secretary, Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to immediately review the 4G mobile internet ban. In particular, the Special Committee was directed to examine the material placed on record by all parties and consider the viability of less restrictive alternatives suggested by the petitioner.\nSince there was no information available in the public domain about the functioning of the Special Committee, FMP was constrained to file a contempt petition before the Supreme Court again on 09 June 2020. The contempt petition was first listed for hearing before the Supreme Court on 16 July 2020, and during this hearing, the Attorney General undertook to file a reply on affidavit within one week (Read more here). The Union Government filed its reply to the contempt petition on 21 July 2020, and subsequently, FMP filed a rejoinder responding to the Union Government\u0026rsquo;s counter-affidavit on 27 July 2020.\nThe matter was listed for hearing before the Supreme Court again today i.e. 28 July 2020. During the hearing, the Solicitor General sought an adjournment since he needed more time to go through FMP\u0026rsquo;s rejoinder. The Court initially adjourned the matter till 05 August 2020 but this date was changed to 07 August 2020 after the Solicitor General stated that officials were likely to be busy with events on 05 August 2020, which is the one year anniversary of abrogation of Article 370 and the communication shutdown.\nUnion of India\u0026rsquo;s Counter-affidavit In its counter-affidavit, the Union Government has stated that the Special Committee has complied with the directions contained in the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s judgement delivered on 11 May 2020. According to the counter-affidavit, the Special Committee has held two meetings so far on 15 May 2020 and 10 June 2020. It is alleged that during these meetings, the Special Committee considered all aspects of the situation including prevailing security concerns, impact of denial of 4G mobile internet services and viability of less restrictive alternatives suggested by the petitioners. However, the minutes of these meetings have not been annexed with the counter-affidavit to corroborate these boilerplate assertions.\nThe counter-affidavit further states that after its second meeting on 10 June 2020, the Special Committee decided that restoration of 4G mobile internet was not desirable at this time and deferred the issue for two months based on a \u0026ldquo;considered and wide-ranging assessment of the prevailing situation in this sensitive region.\u0026quot; A report to this effect was also allegedly submitted by the Special Committee to the Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. The counter-affidavit states that a copy of the report is being placed before the Supreme Court but since the report is not annexed with the counter-affidavit, the Petitioner has not received a copy of the same and it appears to have been filed in sealed cover for the judges' eyes only.\nFMP\u0026rsquo;s Rejoinder In its rejoinder, FMP has challenged the government\u0026rsquo;s refusal to publish any details about the functioning of the Special Committee. The rejoinder contends that such secrecy is inconsistent with the judgements of the Supreme Court in _Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of Indi_a and Shreya Singhal v. Union of India which require publication of orders that restrict fundamental rights to enable aggrieved persons to challenge such orders before a court of law. __ FMP\u0026rsquo;s rejoinder further highlights that by holding only two meetings since 11 May 2020, the Special Committee has also failed to comply with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India which require periodic review of internet restrictions every seven working days.\nThe rejoinder stresses that there is no way for the petitioner to assess or verify the actions of the Special Committee since a copy of the Report submitted by the Committee has not been shared with the petitioner. This is also contrary to the judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India where the Court clearly held that if the State wishes to withhold any material from the petitioner, it must claim a specific ground of privilege on affidavit. Once it does so, the Court will then decide if the claim of privilege overrides the petitioner\u0026rsquo;s rights and even then, a redacted version of the document with sensitive details removed should be shared with the petitioner.\nTo challenge the Union Government\u0026rsquo;s threat assessment, the rejoinder also cites recent statements of the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, G.C. Murmu who has expressed his hope and desire that the Special Committee will restore 4G mobile internet service and stated that high speed internet connectivity will not pose any problem.\nThe matter is listed next on 07 August 2020 and we will keep you updated. FMP was represented in today\u0026rsquo;s proceedings by a legal team led by Senior Advocate, Huzefa Ahmadi and consisting of Advocates Shadan Farasat and Bharat Gupta and IFF associated counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Apar Gupta, and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay.\nImportant Documents  UoI\u0026rsquo;s Counter-affidavit dated 21.07.2020 (link) FMP\u0026rsquo;s Rejoinder dated 27.07.2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/fmp-contempt-petition-rejoinder/","summary":"During today\u0026rsquo;s hearing before the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General sought an adjournment to go through FMP\u0026rsquo;s rejoinder which challenges secrecy in the functioning of the Special Committee.","title":"FMP files rejoinder before SC about Jammu \u0026 Kashmir 4G mobile internet ban #KeepUsOnline"},{"content":"  tl;dr\nThe Chennai and Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project was slated to be completed by June, 2020. However, it has still not been completed with no official statement of a new timeline. We wrote to Shri Kuldeep Rai Sharma, the Honourable Member of Parliament for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands stating our concerns and urging him to escalate the matter with PMO and MeitY.\nThe Chennai and Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project\nOn January 9, 2020, Shri R.S. Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Communications. Electronics \u0026amp; IT and Law \u0026amp; Justice inaugurated the cable-laying work of the CANI Project. The cables are of four-fibre pairs, with the capacity to transfer 6.4 tera-bytes of data per second by each fibre-pair. At the initial stage of commissioning of the project itself, the islands are supposed to get a data speed of 400-gigabytes per second which is nearly 100 times of the existing capacity. The project, which was scheduled to be completed by June, 2020, has still not been completed.\nOn June 5, 2020, we filed a Right to Information request with BSNL (Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands) requesting them to provide us with information about the CANI Project. In their reply dated June 29, 2020, they refused to answer most of our queries and failed to provide us with a timeline of when the project will be completed and operationalized.\n  As pointed out in our previous blogposts (read here and here), access to fast and affordable internet has been a persistent issue in the A\u0026amp;N Islands. This issue has only worsened due to the ongoing pandemic where people have become increasingly dependent on the internet.\nNext step?\nPreviously, we wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Department of Telecommunications highlighting the prevalent issues and providing certain recommendations on June 26, 2020. However, after failing to receive any response from them and in light of the RTI response received we decided to write to Shri Kuldeep Rai Sharma, the Hon’ble Member of Parliament for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In our letter, we have voiced the same concerns and raised similar demands as in our previous letter. Further, we have requested him to escalate the matter with the PMO and DoT so that the people of A\u0026amp;N Islands can be made aware of the current timeline of the CANI Project.\nWant help?\nIf you are a digital rights researcher, or are interested in achieving higher amounts of public disclosure on any issue that impacts fundamental rights and technology then reach out to us.

In its representation, FFF has clarified that it merely provided a template for citizens to submit their objections and the emails were actually sent from personal email IDs of concerned individuals who could edit the content of the email. The representation also strenuously objects to the Delhi Police\u0026rsquo;s characterization of FFF\u0026rsquo;s email campaign as an unlawful and terrorist activity which threatens sovereignty, peace and tranquility and promotes religious hatred.\nBackground Fridays for Future (\u0026lsquo;FFF\u0026rsquo;) is an informal collective of volunteers who trace their roots to the international climate change movement launched by Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists. To protect the environment, FFF has organized climate strikes, tree plantation drives, beach clean ups and email campaigns. Most recently, FFF launched an email campaign to encourage public participation in the consultation being held by the Ministry of Environment and Forests on the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2020 (\u0026lsquo;Draft EIA Notification\u0026rsquo;).\nSince 10 July 2020, FFF\u0026rsquo;s website hosted at https://www.fridaysforfuture.in has been disabled by its domain service provider, Big Rock. Upon enquiry, Big Rock revealed that the website had been blocked in accordance with a notice received from the Delhi Police under Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. A copy of this notice was sent to FFF by Big Rock on 14 July 2020 and it revealed that basis for the notice was a complaint received from Mr. Prakash Javadekar, Minister of Environment and Forests regarding \u0026ldquo;the incident of getting multiple emails on his email address with the subject name similar to ‘EIA 2020’.\u0026quot;\nAfter receiving a complaint from Mr. Javadekar, the Delhi Police conducted some kind of investigation which allegedly revealed that emails were being sent \u0026ldquo;mainly\u0026rdquo; from the FFF website. This sending of emails to a public official has been characterized by the Delhi Police as an act which which “may disturb peace, sovereignty of India” and it has also been alleged that the FFF website displays “objectionable contents and unlawful activities or terrorist act, which are dangerous for the peace, tranquillity and sovereignty of the India (sic)” and contains “religious hatred content/material.”\nRepresentation to the Delhi Police On 22 July 2020, FFF sent a representation to the Delhi Police seeking restoration of its website and highlighted several inaccuracies in the notice issued by the Delhi Police. The representation clarifies that the FFF website merely provided a template to make it easier for citizens to participate in the public consultation on the Draft EIA Notification and it did not send the emails received by Mr. Javadekar which were actually sent by concerned citizens from their personal email IDs. The template provided on the FFF website can be loaded into a person\u0026rsquo;s email service, and after this, the concerned individual is free to edit the content of the email and must choose to hit \u0026lsquo;send.\u0026rsquo; Therefore, FFF does not exercise any control over the content or number of emails which are finally received by public officials.\nIn addition to providing a template, the FFF website also provided email IDs for Mr. Javadekar, the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the dedicated email address for the Draft EIA Notification consultation process. However, these email IDs were already available in the public domain and citizens expressing their concerns to their public representatives is part of any healthy democracy. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic which has made it very difficult for environmentalists to host in person demonstrations or protests. As a result, contacting public officials through digital means is the only way for citizens to express their objections about the Draft EIA Notification.\nIt must also be noted that the short timeline for the consultation process for the Draft EIA Notification has drawn heavy criticism, and the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Delhi High Court has also intervened to extend the deadline for submission of comments till 11 August 2020. In a similar vein, the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Karnataka High Court has directed the government to give wide publicity to the Draft EIA Notification in local languages so that citizens can submit their objections by 11 August 2020. Therefore, even courts have recognized that citizens may face difficulties in participating in the consultation process in such a short time frame, and the email campaign launched by FFF only sought to make this process easier for people concerned about the dilution of environmental protection standards.\nIFF is providing legal assistance to FFF in this matter and we are very grateful to Advocate Abhinav Sekhri and our Of Counsel Vrinda Bhandari for their time and efforts. As an organization born out of the SaveTheInternet movement which involved over a million citizens writing to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India in favour of net neutrality, we fully recognize the importance of digital activism and we are committing to defending the rights of young environmentalists who are trying to create a better future for all of us.\nStatement by FFF India A statement by Friday\u0026rsquo;s For Future on their social media page is embedded below.\nImportant Documents  Notice dated 08.07.2020 sent by Delhi Police (link) Representation dated 22.07.2020 sent by FFF (link) Previous update on blocking of FFF\u0026rsquo;s website (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/fridays-for-future-representation-to-delhi-police/","summary":"Fridays for Future has written to the Delhi Police objecting to the blocking of its website for encouraging public participation in the consultation process for Draft EIA Notification 2020.","title":"Fridays For Future India resists illegal website blocking #WhatTheBlock"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Since domestic air travel was resumed in May 2020, confusion has reigned about whether use of Aarogya Setu is mandatory for passengers. The government has claimed that use of Aarogya Setu is not mandatory and passengers can fill a self-certification form instead. However, in practice, passengers are being forced to download Aarogya Setu prior to entering the airport or boarding their flight due to lack of clarity in the guidelines issued by the government. That\u0026rsquo;s why we are requesting people who have undertaken air travel since May 2020 to fill a survey so we can figure out the scale of the problem and take appropriate remedial measures.\nBackground On 20 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an order removing \u0026ldquo;domestic air travel\u0026rdquo; from the list of activities prohibited during the COVID-19 related nationwide lockdown. Subsequent to this, the Ministry of Civil Aviation issued detailed guidelines for domestic air travel on 21 May 2020. These guidelines provide conflicting information about whether use of Aarogya Setu is mandatory to different stakeholders i.e. passengers, airports and airlines.\nThe government has stated before the Karnataka High Court that use of Aarogya Setu is voluntary and passengers who do not want to download the app can fill a self-certification form instead. However, several passengers have reported that they were asked to show their Aarogya Setu status and they were not given the option of filling a self-certification form. An added complication is that some states also require passengers arriving from other states to download Aarogya Setu prior to leaving the airport at their destination of arrival.\nNeed for systematic data collection The prevailing confusion combined with the information and power asymmetry between passengers and officials has resulted in a situation where Aarogya Setu is voluntary on paper but can be made mandatory in practice. This has also been subject of extensive discussion among our community members on the Internet Freedom Forum and it made us realize that there exists a need to systematically collect data about this problem which goes beyond anecdotal evidence.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we are requesting people who have undertaken air travel since May 2020 to fill this survey so we can figure out the scale of the problem and take appropriate remedial measures. While filling the survey, we request you to fill all the fields of information and briefly describe your experience in your own words, though the latter is optional. The results of the survey will be used only after removing all personally identifiable details of the respondents.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/aarogya-setu-air-travel-survey/","summary":"Take this survey about use of Aarogya Setu for air travel so we can identify the scale of the problem and take appropriate remedial measures.","title":"Survey about use of Aarogya Setu for air travel #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  tl;dr\nIFF’s Project Panoptic aims to bring transparency and accountability to the relevant government stakeholders involved in the deployment and implementation of facial recognition technology (FRT) projects in India.\nProject Panoptic\nIFF aims to increase transparency around the implementation and use of FRT projects through the introduction of a digital public resource. This will be through the deployment of an online dashboard which displays information gathered and collected on FRT deployments across each state.\nThe project aims to build a digital public resource that is intended to aid transparency and accountability around the deployment of facial recognition in India. It will uncover information, analyse it and then present it through an interactive digital resource. Such a resource will be instrumental in assisting policy and legal advocacy as well as drive issue specific public campaigns.\nThis public resource will then be used to drive advocacy on the issue though campaigns and online advocacy. This will enable strategic litigation at the Central and State level by diverse individuals and collectives based on individual harms and injuries that may be suffered by them. The broader aim would be to drive policy changes particularly with regard to data protection legislation in India as well as the introduction of a specific sectoral legislation for facial recognition technology.\nHow is this resource being built?\nThe resource will essentially be a website which will consist of an interactive map tracking the deployment of FRT systems by the government across the country. The resource will also consist of case studies specific to certain projects. One of the main features of the website will be that it will be supported by IFF’s considerable RTI resources. IFF has been filing RTI requests asking for information on each project that we come across to create a database of information which will facilitate us in our drive for transparency and accountability.\nIFF has teamed up with DataKind Bangalore to build this public resource. By clicking on this link you can access the interactive wireframe for the project. The resource is being built with the help of a team of talented and socially conscious volunteers which includes Vivek Shrinivasan, Srivalya Elluru, Srihari Pramod, Vamsi Krishna and Romit Jain.

The contempt petition was filed after the Special Committee constituted by the Supreme Court on 11 May 2020 failed to promptly review the ban on 4G mobile internet in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and publish a reasoned order.\nBackground On 11 May 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement in a petition filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) seeking restoration of 4G mobile internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic (Read more here). The Court constituted a Special Committee comprising (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, (ii) Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, and (iii) Chief Secretary, Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to immediately review the 4G mobile internet ban. In particular, the Special Committee was directed to examine the material placed on record by all parties and consider the viability of less restrictive alternatives suggested by the petitioner.\nSince the constitution of the Special Committee on 11 May 2020, four orders have been issued by the government under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to extend internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. The most recent of these orders was issued on 08 July 2020 and it directs slowdown of mobile internet speed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to 2G till 29 July 2020.\nThe contempt petition was filed by FMP on 09 June 2020 since there was no information available in the public domain about the Special Committee. In particular, there was no information about whether the Special Committtee had been constituted, whether it had held any meetings, whether it had reviewed any of the orders issued by the government or whether it had arrived at a decision. Prior to filing the contempt petition, FMP had also sent two representations to members of the Special Committee urging them to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court but it did not receive any response (Read more here).\nWhat happened during today\u0026rsquo;s hearing?

He emphasized that there was no information available in the public domain about the workings of the Special Committee and this went against the spirit of Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India where it was clearly held that orders must be published to allow an aggrieved person to challenge them before courts (Read more here). He also highlighted the suffering of the people in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir who are being deprived of telemedicine and online education during the COVID-19 pandemic while the rest of the country enjoys these facilities.\nAttorney General KK Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the government insisted that the Special Committee had complied with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions. The Attorney General stated that the Special Committee had been constituted and it had held two meetings so far on 15 May 2020 and 10 June 2020. He further claimed the Special Committee was examining the impact of internet restrictions on education, health, business activities and freedom of speech. However, since there has been a rise in terrorism in the region, the Special Committee decided to defer the issue for two months after its last meeting. Finally, he offered to place the minutes of the meetings of the Special Committee before the judges in sealed cover. This means that the petitioner would not be allowed to have access to the minutes of the meetings.\nAfter hearing oral arguments from both sides, the three judge bench consisting of Ramana J., B.R.

IFF has sent them a legal notice asking them to recall the RFP citing concerns of violations of fundamental rights of privacy and freedom of speech and expression.\nThe Revised RFP\nOn June 22, 2020, the NCRB recalled and cancelled the original RFP [Document Reference: 02/001] that it had issued on July 3, 2019. A revised RFP [Document Reference: 02/001 (Revised)] was issued in its place. We had previously sent a legal notice ref. no. IFF/2019/115 dated July 18, 2019 to NCRB asking them to recall the original RFP. However, the current recall and cancellation fails to resolve our initial concerns pertaining to the AFRS project as raised in that legal notice. Additionally, having gone through the revised RFP, we have come across changes which have raised new concerns for us.\nA. Functional Scope of the Project\nOne of the most important changes which have been made in the revised RFP is that it now states that the project “does not involve the installation of CCTV camera nor will it connect to any existing CCTV camera anywhere”. This is a departure from the original RFP wherein CCTV integration had been included as a functional requirement.\nB. Functional Requirements\nIn the functional requirements for AFRS, the revised RFP has introduced the requirement wherein the technology should be able to carry out N:N combination search. Previously, the original RFP required the technology to be able to carry out searches which responded to 1:1 (identification) and 1:N (verification) combinations. The RFP does not provide insight into the nature of searches which will be carried out through N:N combination searches. Since N:N combinations searches have various definitions in foundational literature, there is no clarity with regard to the use case for which they will be utilised. Vagueness in terms of purpose of use is harmful since it allows for the possibility of function creep.\nC. Technical Requirements\n Integration with existing crime analytics solutions  In the revised RFP, a new technical requirement has been mandated wherein the AFRS platform which is being built should be able to integrate with existing crime analytics solutions with the Police for providing unique attributes on images/visuals. Crime analytics solution has not been defined in the RFP and could thus be interpreted in a wide sense to include CCTV footage which contradicts the previous statements in the RFP which talk about restricting integration with CCTV cameras. It would thus be useful if a clarification is issued wherein “existing crime analytics solutions” are defined with emphasis on their scope.\nIntegration with existing crime analytics solutions could thus mean integration of AFRS with private vendor solutions which could lead to questions about data access and sharing. Another question which arises is the scope of the existing solutions. Since different solutions are currently being used by different states, will integration mean scaling up the entire solution for use at the national level automatically or will the solution be vetted first at the national level. Another interpretation could be that existing state-level solutions will only be integrated with AFRS in that particular state.\nDilution of technical requirements  In the revised RFP, there is no mention of the international standards which were included in the original RFP which had to be complied with as a technical requirement. The reason behind the exclusion of these standards is unclear and raises the question of why necessary standards of technical requirements are being diluted.\nD. Functional architecture\n Scene of Crime (SOC) images/videos included as a data source  In the revised RFP, a new data source \u0026ldquo;Scene of Crime images/videos\u0026rdquo; has been introduced for input into the AFRS database. This inclusion is at odds with the previous assertion made in the RFP - that integration of CCTVs will not take place. Deletion of CCTV camera footage as a data source leaves a gap in the functional architecture of AFRS and the RFP fails to satisfactorily account for its replacement. The RFP also fails to mention how the data and subsequent analysis/ information which is obtained through AFRS will be presented and utilized in a court of law, i.e., the nature of the evidence obtained from AFRS and its admissibility as pertaining to its reliability in courts.\nList of databases which would be integrated with AFRS changed  The original RFP provided a list of databases from which data was to be gathered to create the AFRS database. This list of databases has now been removed from the revised RFP and has been replaced with the term “dynamic police databases”. The lack of definitional clarity and broad scope surrounding this term sets up the AFRS for function creep and an open ended data sharing/mining endeavor, which is untenable in law.\nThe AFRS violates the right to privacy\nAs per the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1) any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution must conform to certain thresholds. These thresholds are:\n Legality  Where the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions. As pointed out in our previous legal notice as well, there is no anchoring legislation which allows for and regulates the use of AFRS. In the absence of such a framework and safeguards, the first requirement for lawful restriction on the right to privacy is not met.\nNecessity  Which justifies that the restriction to people’s privacy (in this case data collection and sharing) is needed in a democratic society to fulfill a legitimate state aim. In the RFP, it is stated that the need for AFRS arises because it will enable automatic identification and verification through criminal databases which would help investigation of crime and tracking and detection of criminals.\nThis characterisation is based on a faulty assumption that facial recognition technology is accurate and would provide speedy and correct results. However, ongoing research in the field has shown that facial recognition technology which is completely accurate has not been developed yet. Use of such inaccurate technology, especially for criminal prosecution, could thus result in a false positive, i.e., misidentification of an innocent individual as a suspect in a crime. Thus, AFRS fails to meet the requirement of necessity as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Puttaswamy judgment.\nProportionality  Where the Government must show among other things that the measure being undertaken has a rational nexus with the objective. The AFRS contemplates collecting sensitive personal information, intimate information of all individuals in the absence of any reasonable suspicion by collecting images and videos from a scene of crime. This could cast a presumption of criminality on a broad set of people. In the Supreme Court’s decision in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2019) 1 SCC 1 or the Aadhaar judgment , the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that:\n“[u]nder the garb of prevention of money laundering or black money, there cannot be such a sweeping provision which targets every resident of the country as a suspicious person”\nWhile this statement was made in the context of rejecting the mandatory linkage of Aadhaar with bank accounts to counter money laundering, it clearly shows that imposition of such a restriction on the entire population, without any evidence of wrongdoing on their part, would constitute a disproportionate response. Similarly, collecting sensitive personal information of all individuals who were present at the scene of crime creates a presumption of criminality which is disproportionate to the objective it aims to achieve.\nProcedural safeguards  Where there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse. At present, there is no independent institutional mechanism which would put in place procedural safeguards in the RFP which will regulate the proposed project. In the absence of any checks and balances, function creep becomes an immediate problem wherein the issue of AFRS being used for functions more than its stated purpose becomes a reality. Use of AFRS without safeguards could result in illegal state-sponsored mass surveillance which would have a chilling effect on fundamental rights such right to freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of association which are guaranteed in the Constitution. Fear of identification and retaliation by the state would deter individuals from exercising their fundamental right to protest which is included in the freedom of speech and expression.\nThus, our legal notice asks the NCRB to recall the revised RFP that they have issued as it fails to satisfy the thresholds laid down in the Puttaswamy judgment and is violative of the fundamental right to privacy, right to freedom of speech and expression and freedom of movement. This legal notice has been drafted with the help and insights of Smriti Parsheera and Vidushi Marda.\nProject Panoptic\nIFF has been tracking the RFP for AFRS since last year. Additionally, under our Project Panoptic, we have also been tracking all other instances of facial recognition use in the country that we have come across. Our main aim behind this project is to increase transparency and accountability from the authorities who are implementing these projects.\nOne of the ways in which we demand transparency is through filing Right to Information requests.

Union of India. The judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India was delivered on 10 January, and since then, several states have imposed internet shutdowns without publishing the legal orders under which these internet shutdowns were imposed. Such secrecy is a violation of the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions and undermines the rule of law.\nBackground In Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the Supreme Court was called upon to determine the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 05 August 2019. In its judgement, the Court noted that there were several gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 and it read certain procedural safeguards into the Rules to fill this lacuna. You can read a more detailed summary of the judgement here.\nSpecifically, in para 96 of its judgement, the Supreme Court held that all internet shutdown orders must be proactively published by the government.\n “It must be noted that although the Suspension Rules does not provide for publication or notification of the orders, a settled principle of law, and of natural justice, is that an order, particularly one that affects lives, liberty and property of people, must be made available …. We are therefore required to read in the requirement of ensuring that all the orders passed under the Suspension Rules are made freely available, through some suitable mechanism. ”\n Recent Internet Shutdowns After the Supreme Court delivered its judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India on 10 January 2020, several states have imposed internet shutdowns but we could not find any copies of the legal orders on official government websites or through media reports for the following instances.\n Madhya Pradesh: On 31.01.2020, mobile internet services were suspended in Jabalpur in anticipation of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019. Although the Deputy Inspector General confirmed the issuance of an internet suspension order by the District Magistrate to a media outlet, we could not find a copy of the order itself in the public domain. Meghalaya: On 28.02.2020, mobile internet services were suspended for 48 hours in six districts of Meghalaya after clashes over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Uttar Pradesh: On 27.02.2020, mobile internet services were suspended by the District Magistrate for two days in Aligarh after clashes over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. West Bengal: From 18.02.2020 to 27.02.2020, internet services were supposed to be suspended across seven districts in West Bengal to prevent cheating in Class X Madhyamik exams. You can read more about this here. Further, from 13.05.2020 to 17.05.2020, mobile internet services were suspended in Hooghly after clashes over movement in containment zones.  Importance of Transparency Publication of internet shutdown orders and proper record-keeping is essential for two reasons. First, without access to internet shutdown orders, citizens cannot exercise their fundamental right to seek judicial review of arbitrary or disproportionate restrictions on internet access. Second, internet shutdowns cause huge economic losses and maintaining a consolidated record of all internet shutdowns imposed at the state and central level is necessary for evidence based policy reform.\nWithout official publication of orders, the only source of information about internet shutdowns in different parts of the country is media reports. However, the figures derived based on media reports do not represent the full scale of the problem and may fail to include shutdowns which are shorter in duration or localized in small towns and villages. In any case, even the limited information which is available through media reports suggests that internet shutdowns are being ordered by government officials who are not authorized under the law. For instance, media reports indicate that internet shutdowns in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were ordered by District Magistrates who are not empowered to exercise powers under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. Prior to 2017, internet shutdowns were ordered by District Magistrates under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. However, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the Supreme Court has clarified that the position of law has changed after notification of the Rules in 2017 and the procedure prescribed under the Rules must be followed prior to imposing internet shutdowns.\nRecommendations and Demands Through this representation, we have formally called upon the Central and State Governments to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India and correct past lapses by undertaking the following measures:\n Proactively publish all internet shutdown orders on official government websites and widely disseminate this information through the media. Issue an advisory to all District Magistrates clarifying that internet shutdowns can no longer be imposed under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973. The Central Government should maintain a consolidated repository of all internet shutdown orders issued in different parts of the country and this repository should be made available to the general public.  As we had noted previously noted, the judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India is the beginning of a long uphill campaign to reform the legal framework and institutional practices surrounding internet shutdowns in India. This representation is one of the many follow up actions we have undertaken to ensure meaningful enforcement of the judgement and we remain fully committed to sustained advocacy which is necessary to convert principles into practice.\nImportant Documents  Representation dated 14.07.2020 to Department of Telecom and State Governments (link) Representation dated 03.04.2020 to Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs and Ministry of Law \u0026amp; Justice (link) Representation dated 22.02.2020 to the Government of West Bengal (link) Summary of judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v.

As adopters of digital campaigning we get how it advances the best ideals of our constitution. It deepens participatory democracy and allows diverse voices to reach out to government on important policy decisions. Today, as we face the Covid-19 pandemic, we need to think about the future. An essential foundation of this thinking is our natural environment – our air, water, forests and rivers. Here, the sustained and irrefutable research on climate change has been become a mainstream conversation due to the activism of spirited, young campaigners.\nThey take risks today, for our shared future. They drive strength to their physical congregations, climate strikes, clean-ups spread over diverse regions in India through digital modes. These modes also help them spur greater awareness and reach out to people and the government. Here, at least three disturbing acts of web censorship have to our notice. We are providing assistance in some of these cases prioritising the safety and security of the members of these collectives as much as enabling their continuing work to secure our environment.\nDomain blocks on LetIndiaBreathe.in and FridaysForFuture In total three acts of web censorship have come to our notice in the past week against environmental groups in India.

To better consider more urgent issues, better foresight and planning is needed in four vital areas.

This will help evidence based and considered policy making responses within legislation.\n Issue 1: Growth of mass surveillance  After consistent follow up, we were able to obtain through the Right to Information the bulk requisition of CDRs of telecom subscribers in various telecom circles. As per a letter of concern by telecom operators through an industry association this would impact every subscriber including high public functionaries including High Court and Supreme Court judges and Parliamentarians. All of this correspondence is contained on the following link.\n Issue 2: Indiscriminate website blocking  Second, the blocking of websites is being done in an increasingly arbitrary manner as evidenced through the following documentation below. This is among other things a net neutrality violation but also an uncanalised and secretive use of powers under the Information Technology Act, the Telegraph Act and the UA Licenses. These include, block on the popular file sharing service WeTransfer dated June 09, 2020 (link); blocking of “Chinese apps” dated July 1, 2020 (link); blocking of the privacy focussed search engine DuckDuckGo dated July 2, 2020 (link). We are at present receiving alarming reports on the SaveTheInternet inconsistent blocking of the social networking platform Reddit and New York Times.\n Issue 3: Illegal and unregulated State use of facial recognition technology  The growth of growth of facial recognition technology in India is reaching alarming proportions. Much of this use is illegal and not sanctioned by law. It’s widespread use in policing is a matter of concern and undermines the democractic guarantees and fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. We have tangibly demonstrated this through its use by the Delhi Police as available in a recent public post dated July 3, 2020.\n Issue 4: Reforming and examining the constitutional basis of Internet Shutdowns  The Committee may consider the absence of reform of the process and power on Internet Shutdowns as per a assurances to bring it in compliance with the Supreme Court’s Judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v.

S.66A of the IT Act is termed as a legal zombie since, even though it was declared unconstitutional in 2015, its use is ongoing. Currently, we have mined, curated and verified our dataset. Moving forward, we are working on building the tracker interface as well as conducting secondary research. We intend to use the insights gained from collected data to strengthen our advocacy efforts to ensure that S. 66A dies a complete constitutional death.\nWe are building a Zombie Tracker! ****\nSection 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India in March, 2015 in Shreya Singhal v Union of India. The Court declared that the provision was void ab initio i.e was deemed to never have existed on the statute books. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A. However, in 2018, a research paper by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta highlighted that Section 66A was being still used for legal prosecutions all over the country. Taking note of the above-mentioned study, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (‘PUCL’), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal case approached the court in January, 2019 highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court’s decision. Inspite of repeated directions by the Supreme Court as late as 2019, our preliminary research shows that, S. 66A is still being invoked in fresh cases. Our preliminary findings were backed by a recent media report which highlights the continued invocation of S.66A. Further, we noticed that the mountain of pending cases including a charge under S.66A is ever increasing. Therefore, we are building a tool to track registered cases which include a charge under S.66A. We intend to use the data and insights generated from it to bolster our advocacy efforts to ensure that no fresh charge is registered under S.66A and pending charges under S.66A are dismissed.\nThe Zombie Tracker will be tracking cases which include a charge under S.66A at the district level, across 11 states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal. The tracker will be collecting case data using the E-Courts application programming interface (API) , for the period 27th October 2009 to 15th February 2020.\nProgress\nFirst, we conducted a manual search to identify if all cases on the website including a charge under S.66A were tagged as such on the E-courts website. During our manual tests on the E-courts website, we observed the following:\n Some cases which included a charge under S.66A, were tagged as Information Technology Act, but not as a 66A case under the section tags; Some cases including a charge under S.66A were tagged as S.66a instead certain sections of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) were repeatedly invoked with a charge under S.66A  We therefore decided to, at the first instance, cast our net to include all cases under the Information Technology Act, 2000. Considering the consistent presence of certain IPC provision, we further cast our net to include all cases under these* provisions of the IPC.\nThe above list of cases was then manually curated on the basis of sections invoked in the cases. Cases involving any variation of 66A i.e. 66a, 66(a),66AC etc. were flagged positive, and the rest of the cases were filtered out. This resulted in a list of cases with 1163 section tag combinations. This list was then further manually curated by reference to judgements and orders, where present, to create the final data set. Cases without an order/judgement were marked negative and filtered out to avoid a false positive result. A false positive, in this scenario, will result when a case is improperly reported as including a charge under S.66A, when in reality it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. There are a number of cases with ambiguous tags which we have not been able to verify due to the lack of orders/judgements. Due to our inability to verify them these cases have currently been excluded from our final dataset.\nThe way forward\nWe now have our final data set and are proceeding to analyse the data generated. We are also conducting secondary research to generate meaningful insights from the dataset, which can help support our advocacy efforts. Alongside our research, we are collaborating with CivicDataLab to build the tracker platform. We aim that our platform will, firstly, highlight the number of cases with an pending under S.66A as well as the number of cases registered after the decision of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal. Secondly, we intend to present our findings to the judiciary and law enforcement bodies to ensure S.66A is not invoked again and any pending charges are dismissed. Lastly, we hope to provide a privacy preserving open data set to aid researchers in further research and analysis.\nDuring our research, one of the main hurdles we have encountered is the incompleteness of data available on the E-courts website. Currently less than 20% of the decided cases in our dataset have an order or judgement available. This unavailability of documents has hampered our data verification process.\nYour experience might help our verification efforts, to ensure no case with a charge under S.66A is missed out. Have you been threatened with a charge under S.66A? Have you been charged under s.66A? Do you know someone who was or is currently charged under S.66A? If yes please forward the following survey to them. Your experience can help reinforce our efforts, tell us your story by filling out this survey:\nFurther updates on the Zombie Tracker will be issued closer to the platform launch.

Our main recommendations were the inclusion of certain privacy protecting measures in the rules regulating aerial photography and the introduction of a new rule which would prohibit aerial surveillance for law enforcement purposes.\nThe Draft UAS Rules, 2020 The draft Unmanned Aircraft System Rules, 2020 were notified on June 2, 2020. An unmanned aircraft system includes a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone, a ground based controller and a system of communications between the two. These will apply to the possession of drone, engagement in importing, manufacturing, trading, leasing, operating, transferring or maintaining a drone in India or to all UAS for the time being in or over India.\nWe have previously sent a legal notice (Ref. No. 143/2019) to the DGCA on December 27, 2019 on the illegal use of drones by the Delhi Police during the December 2019 protests. However, in February we came across reports that illegal use of drones was ongoing. As a result we filed a Right to Information request (RTI Reference No. DEPOL/R/E/20/01005) dated February 14, 2020 with the Delhi Police inquiring about their use of drones. In their reply (No.953/RTI Cell/North East District) dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones.\nOn May 2, 2020 the MCA issued a conditional exemption wherein they allowed government authorities to procure drones for COVID-19 related activities which included aerial photography and surveillance. In response to this conditional exemption and the ongoing illegal use of drones by the Delhi Police for surveillance, we sent a representation (Ref. No IFF/2020/141) to the MCA and DGCA asking them to recall the conditional exemption and to commence an investigation into the ongoing illegal use of drones by the Delhi Police for mass surveillance.\nIFF’s recommendations We have made two recommendations to the DGCA on the draft UAS Rules, 2020. Firstly, we have recommended certain additions into Rule 35 of the draft rules which talks about aerial photography by UAS. We have recommended that certain privacy protecting measures be added to the rule to ensure that it protects the personally identifiable data of any individual whose image is captured. Our second recommendation is to introduce a new rule which addresses aerial surveillance by UAS that is specifically used by law enforcement agencies.\nCurrently Rule 35 reads as follows:\n Photography from UA in flight. — (1) An imagery may be captured by an unmanned aircraft except in the non permissible area after ensuring the privacy of an individual and his property.\n While the rule does mention ensuring the privacy of the individual and his property, it fails to provide any measures which will ensure the privacy to be protected. Hence, it is our recommendation that the following privacy protecting measures be included in Rule 35.\n (2) Imagery may be captured by an unmanned aircraft of an individual and/or their property when it is personally identifiable only after taking their consent. For recording this consent, the appropriate government may notify a form contained with the schedule.\n  (3) The individual who is providing consent should be informed of the purpose of the photography. A special declaration should be provided if the photography is being done by government authorities. The special declaration should provide the individual with a list of all authorities with whom the personal data collected could be further shared.\n  (4) The personally identifiable data collected should only be stored for the period of time necessary to fulfill the purpose of the photography. Subsequently, the personally identifiable data should be deleted.\n  (5) The personally identifiable data collected should be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only for fulfilling the purpose as disclosed to the individual. It should not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.\n  (6) The personally identifiable data is processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personally identifiable data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures including security and technical audits. Such practices should be documented within a cyber security policy and made available to persons whose personal identifiable information is captured.\n Our second recommendation is related to the insertion of a new rule which would prohibit aerial surveillance by drones for law enforcement purposes and would also prohibit the integration of facial recognition technology with drones for the purpose of surveillance. This recommendation was made especially because in January, 2020 we came across reports that the Delhi Police used facial recognition and drone technology to surveil the Republic Day parade.\nInsertion of these rules are necessary in order to regulate aerial surveillance from occurring which leads to the collection of personally identifiable data of individuals over a large field of vision. This requires consistency to comply with the decision of nine judges of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (“right to privacy case”). It is important to consider that the privacy right under the judgement applies even in public spaces and to acts of aerial surveillance since as per the right to privacy case. This is given that it emerges from principles of individual autonomy and there exists continuing control for individuals over the personally identifiable information gathered over them.\nImportant Documents  Covering letter and substantial response to the DGCA on the Draft UAS Rules dated July 3, 2020 (link) The Draft Unmanned Aircraft System Rules, 2020 (link) The DGCA must take urgent action against the illegal use of surveillance drones dated December 28, 2019 (link) Delhi Police admits to using drones on civilians without any publicly available legal guidelines in place dated March 27, 2020 (link) The ongoing illegal use of drones for mass surveillance by the Delhi Police needs to be investigated (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/we-wrote-to-dgca-with-recommendations-on-the-draft-unmanned-aircraft-system-drones-rules-2020/","summary":"Read our recommendations to the DGCA on the Draft UAS (Drones) Rules.

We have been constantly engaging with them through legal notices, representations and right to information requests to understand the full picture. In this blogpost, we collate and analyze our findings. Use of facial recognition without having a legal framework in place to regulate it raises the threat of state-sponsored mass surveillance.\nThe Delhi Police is using Facial Recognition\nDuring the protests which took place last year, multiple reports emerged of the Delhi Police using facial recognition technology. On December 28, 2019, we sent a legal notice to the Delhi Police asking them to halt the use of facial recognition in Delhi. However, reports emerged that even in 2020 use of facial recognition by the Delhi Police is ongoing.\nIt is important to note here that use of facial recognition technology is being done in Delhi without there being any legal framework in place to regulate it. This is violative of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India. It states that any justifiable intrusion by the State into people’s right to privacy protected under Article 21 of the Constitution must conform to certain thresholds. These thresholds are:\n legality where the intrusion must take place a defined regime of law i.e. there must be an anchoring legislation, with a clear set of provisions; necessity which justifies that the restriction to people’s privacy is needed in a democratic society; proportionality where the Government must show among other things that the measure being undertaken has a rational nexus with the objective. The state must also demonstrate that there are no other alternatives both analog and digital which can fulfill said mandate; and procedural safeguards, where there is an appropriate independent institutional mechanism, with in-built procedural safeguards aligned with standards of procedure established by law which are just, fair and reasonable to prevent abuse.  What did we find out?\nOn January 24, 2020 we filed a Right to Information request with the Delhi Police asking them questions pertaining to their use of facial recognition and the legality of this use.\n  In their reply dated February 20, 2020, the Delhi Police stated that the legal framework based on which they have acquired facial recognition technology is the Delhi High Court’s decision in Sadhan Haldar v NCT of Delhi.\n  It is pertinent to note here that in Sadhan Haldar v NCT of Delhi, the Court has authorised the Delhi Police to obtain facial recognition technology for the purpose of tracking and re-uniting missing children. However, in their reply to our RTI request, in response to our query asking about the purpose for which the Delhi Police is using facial recognition, they replied that the technology is being used to match similar faces for police investigation.\nThis is a clear instance of function creep. Function creep occurs when a technology or system gradually widens its scope from its original purpose to encompass and fulfill wider functions. This is the major concern among many privacy experts with regard to the use of facial recognition technology wherein they are worried that its use will exceed past the indicated purpose of security and will end up facilitating state-sponsored mass surveillance.\nThis has already come to pass in Delhi with the Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah saying in the Rajya Sabha that “ over 1,900 faces have been identified through facial recognition software for inciting violence in the national capital during the Delhi riots.” Use of facial recognition against individuals protesting against the actions of the government sets a chilling precedent and also threatens the fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Constitution to each citizen including the right to freedom of expression.\nThis is even more worrisome due to the fact that accuracy rates of facial recognition technology, as disclosed by the Delhi Police themselves in an affidavit in the High Court, are extremely low. In 2018, Delhi Police reported that the facial recognition system on trial was operating at an accuracy rate of 2 per cent. In 2019, when the accuracy rate fell to less than 1 per cent, the Ministry of Women and Child Development reported that the system couldn’t even accurately distinguish between boys and girls.\nProject Panoptic\nIFF has been tracking the development of the Delhi Police’s facial recognition system since last year. Additionally, under our Project Panoptic, we have also been tracking all other instances of facial recognition use in the country that we have come across. Our main aim behind this project is to increase transparency and accountability from the authorities who are implementing these projects.\nOne of the ways in which we demand transparency is through filing Right to Information requests.

Yesterday, close to 300 reports were received by us concerning the inability of internet users in India to access DuckDuckGo through the SaveTheInternet platform. Today, we wrote to the Telecom Department and the IT Ministry. We have also filed RTIs.\nFirst, who sanctioned this Duck Hunt? DuckDuckGo is a privacy respecting search engine that has a wide user base in India. Respect by technologists globally and presenting an alternate model to surveillance capitalism it presents a successful deployment of a rights respecting product. Hence, when yesterday around noon when reports start filtering in that users in India could not access it, many thought it was a technical error with a specific internet service provider.\nTo gather the reason behind it we promoted active reporting through the SaveTheInternet.in. This tool till date has gathered close to 1500 reports, and yesterday close to 300 people all across India, from various cities and towns, with different types of internet connections serviced by several ISPs reported this common problem. This lead us to believe that the reason for this block, was a direction by the Government.\nTo address this, today we wrote to the Department of Telecom and the Ministry of Electronics and IT. We called on them to:\n Issue a press release setting out in a detail the reasons for a direction to block DuckDuckGo, if any. This press release must be accompanied by the legal order if it does exist. If such an order does exist, examine options to keep it in abeyance till the opportunity of hearing and defence is provisioned for the owners and users of DuckDuckGo. Here, ordinary internet users should be provided an opportunity to present the use cases and value the platform provides to them. We restate our larger asks for wider reform are contained in the prior representation dated June 09, 2020 bearing reference number IFF/2020/139 that calls on a overhaul of the website blocking process that suffers from secrecy and a lack of public participation.  You can read the text of this representation and the reports at the bottom which links to all our documents. As we identified in our prior blogposts the problem of website blocking is widespread in which secrecy is a threshold problem which must be addressed through comprehensive reforms. We have also filed RTI requests specific to the DuckDuckGo block. In our requests to MeitY and DoT, we have asked them provide us with a copy of the blocking order pursuant to which the website was blocked as well as information with regard to the specific ground under the IT Act which was invoked for the blocking.\n    We are committed to keep working on this and will provide regular updates.

The reasons for this include national security and protection of user privacy and security. This sets a concerning precedent and may be a singular action of web censorship that has impacted more people India than ever before. In this post, we, through our statement, indicate areas of concerns around the legality of the process and also indicate how, by filing Right to Information requests, we are hoping for greater public disclosure.\nA concerning act of web censorship On June 29, through a press release the Government of India acting through the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) banned 59 smartphone applications. To provide clarity from the perspective of digital rights of users we published an initial statement linked below.\nWe are substantiating this initial statement with a detailed analysis which indicates several concerns on the legality of the blocking process. To achieve further clarity and transparency we have also yesterday morning filed several right to information requests.\nThe detailed statement follows below:\n As firm believers in the Constitution of India our mission is to ensure that technology should further the goals set out in the preamble. These goals cannot be achieved if the integrity and the security of India is compromised. To safeguard them our republic prescribes clear means and measures that are premised on a democratic framework. The hallmark of this are our fundamental rights.\n  In one of the most significant cases concerning the interaction of these fundamental rights with digital technologies, hearing a challenge against Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 the Supreme Court also had occasion to examine the power of the Government to issue directions to block web services. This power contained under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 contains the power to issue directions for blocking along with its grounds in it\u0026rsquo;s first sub-section. The second-subsection to Section 69A contains a requirement to establish a process and safeguards under which the IT Blocking Rules, 2009 have been made.\n  This power has been purportedly been exercised by the Ministry of Electronics and IT on June 29, 2020 which has been publicly disclosed through a press release through the Press Information Bureau (PIB). This press release indicates distinct grounds under which 59 smartphone applications have been blocked that are contained under in an Annexure. The release contains references to threats to the security, integrity of India and public order of an \u0026ldquo;emergent nature\u0026rdquo; for which the direction to block these web services are \u0026ldquo;emergency measures\u0026rdquo;. The further basis of this direction to block is premised on purported complaints including a recommendation from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Committee, Ministry of Home Affairs and complaints received by CERT-In. Further references are made to debates and comments made in Parliament.\n  While acknowledging the real harm which occurs to the privacy and security of users due to the unregulated expropriation of their personal data we are also concerned with a restriction of their right to receive information and use such services. As per our reading of Section 69A it does not extend to directions for blocking smartphone applications but individual pieces of information and content. We are particularly concerned with the legal process which has been initiated for these directions given they do not contain any available technical analysis against any specific application prior to the media release on the direction for blocking. This sets a worrying precedent and tremendous expansion of the power to block web services in India.\n  There seems to be any pre-decisional hearing which has been afforded to any of these 59 web-services and given they have been accessible for a long period of time a regular process in which they were afforded a hearing would be naturally expected. Such \u0026ldquo;emergent circumstances\u0026rdquo; even when they did emerge do not specifically indicate any technical assessments conducted by CERT-In and do not also clearly indicate whether they are linked to recent border tensions caused due to China given there is a natural inference that many of these web services are of Chinese origin or control.\n  The press release is a drastic step and expansion in the practice of website blocking. It presents risk of setting a precedent that will undermine the digital rights of Indian internet users. Such directions are in deviation from the rule of law framework under the provisions of the Information Technology Act and the judgement of the Supreme Court as adverted above. In view of the above we call on the Government of India to publish the legal order (not a media release) and make proper disclosures. We further urge that specific regulatory instruments such as the Data Protection Bill to safeguard individual privacy must be advanced. Further if action is needed due to security reasons in examining foreign control made in core sectors such as technology and telecoms then appropriate policy conversations may be initiated. Here non-compliance can be penalised in an objective and evidence based manner with a clear legal standard that may include fines and directions to abstain from illegal conduct.\n  We caution against the expansion of the power to block web-services. This is bad for users, innovation, the larger technology ecosystem of India. We urge the Government to reconsider this dangerous step which sets a worrying precedent for digital rights.\n In view of this statement and to seek further transparency we have initiated steps commencing with the filing of Right to Information Requests with several government departments.\nRight to Information requests filed by IFF\nYesterday morning, we filed Right to Information requests with multiple authorities in the hopes of bringing transparency and accountability to the process through which this ban is being implemented. Requests have been filed with the Ministry of Electronic \u0026amp; Information Technology (MeitY) through its Department of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (DeitY) and Department of Telecommunication (DoT). We have also filed a separate request with the DeitY for obtaining information from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) which operates under the department. Lastly we have filed a request with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to obtain information about their involvement in the ban. Below we have provided insight into each of these requests.\nA. Right to Information requests with MeitY\ni. With DeitY and DoT on the ban\nIn our requests dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No.s DITEC/R/E/20/00519 (DeitY) and DOTEL/R/E/20/00577 (DoT), we asked these two authorities to provide us with copies of the actual order issued by MeitY banning these applications, since currently we only have a press release and not the actual order. Obtaining the order is crucial since it contains the reasons for the ban which are important when we try to assess the legality and validity of the ban. We also asked them whether the process which is stated under S.69A of the IT Act and the Blocking Rules, 2009 for blocking of websites was followed in the implementation of this ban. This process includes giving notice, having a hearing and providing a reasoned order for blocking.\n  \u0026ldquo;RTI Ref. No. DITEC/R/E/20/00519 filed with DeitY dated 30.6.2020\u0026rdquo;\n  In the press release, it is stated that the blocking was being done because MeitY had \u0026ldquo;received many complaints various sources including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India.\u0026rdquo; In our request, we asked them to provide us copies of these complaints. Additionally, we asked them whether they had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out.\n  \u0026ldquo;RTI Ref. No. DOTEL/R/E/20/00577 filed with DoT dated 30.6.2020\u0026rdquo;\n  ii. With DeitY for obtaining information from CERT-IN\nIn our request dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No. DITEC/R/E/20/00521, we asked DeitY to provide us with information about the role played by CERT-IN in the implementation of the ban. According to the press release, CERT-IN \u0026ldquo;has also received many representations from citizens regarding security of data and breach of privacy impacting upon public order issues\u0026rdquo;. Thus, we asked them to provide us with a copy of all the representations that they have received which flag such concerns about the blocked applications. Additionally, we asked them to provide us with the minutes of the any meetings that they held wherein this issue was discussed as a measure of increasing transparency and accountability. Finally, we asked them whether CERT-IN had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out.\n  \u0026ldquo;RTI Ref. No. DITEC/R/E/20/00521 filed with DeitY dated 30.6.2020\u0026rdquo;\n  B. Right to Information Requests with MHA\nIn our request dated June 30, 2020 with Ref. No. MHOME/R/E/20/03251, we asked MHA to provide us with a copy of all the representations that they had received which were \u0026ldquo;raising concerns from citizens regarding security of data and risk to privacy relating to operation of certain apps\u0026rdquo; as stated in the press release. It was also stated in the press release that the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), which operates under the MHA, had \u0026ldquo;sent an exhaustive recommendation for blocking these malicious apps\u0026rdquo;. We asked them to provide us with a copy of this recommendation as it would help us in assessing the reasons behind the ban.\nWe also asked them to provide us with the minutes of the any meetings that I4C held wherein this issue was discussed. Additionally, we asked them whether I4C had carried out any objective assessments on the privacy impact of these applications and to provide us with a copy of the reports of these assessments if they had been carried out. Finally, we asked them to provide us with a copy of all the correspondence which took place between the MHA and MeitY with regard to the ban.\n  \u0026ldquo;RTI Ref.

In it, TRAI offered stakeholders a final opportunity to submit written submissions by June 29, 2020. IFF has taken the liberty to share a supplementary submission, to complement our earlier comments and counter comments. The purpose behind this is to emphasise the regulatory importance of focusing on strong implementation and enforcement; and the centrality of public/user participation.\nBackground TRAI has been working on building a suitable implementation framework to monitor and enforce the Government of India’s net neutrality amendments dated July 2018. On January 02 2020, TRAI released a fresh consultation paper on net neutrality. The consultation sought to resolve two broad issues. The first is to determine what constitutes reasonable network management practices (“TMPs”) by internet operators consistent with the core principle of non-discriminatory treatment of online content.\nThe second is determining suitable institutional design, compliance requirements and technical interventions to monitor the behaviour of your internet operators. Resolving this helps arrive at a framework which can trigger appropriate interventions and ensure strict compliance. You may read more about the consultation paper through our summary here.\nIFF’s Earlier Comments and Counter Comments Our initial comments to the consultation paper stressed on ensuring that the actual implementation of the framework remains individual and user centric. We advocated that the framework does not drift towards a scenario where your internet provider has undue influence on the actual enforcement. The primary risks may arise due to:\n Regulations which offer internet providers a pass and they do not have to publish enough information (in terms of quality and quantity). Vague regulations which offer your provider with enough discretion to discriminate between different types of services on an arbitrary basis. Think of a scenario wherein your gaming streams, P2P file sharing applications or encrypted traffic is performing worse because your internet provider has made some decision behind closed doors. Prolonged “wait and watch approach” could be used as a veil which prevents any enforcement mechanism in the interim. A dearth appropriate traffic measurement systems Finally, if a multistakeholder body, which is meant to be representative of the entire public, and will advise authorities on enforcement is cornered by your internet provider and large internet businesses.  During the counter comments phase we noticed that large industry stakeholders, especially telecom representatives, like Airtel, Reliance Jio, Broadband India Forum and the Cellular Operators Association of India were largely following the same script. Among other things they advocated for light touch frameworks; wide exceptions in terms of what is allowed as network management practices; authorities stay away from technical monitoring tools; and a complete rejection for any inclusive multistakeholder body. These stakeholders either advocated for no advisory body or at best one which is skewed in favour of telecom players.\nThey also requested TRAI legitimise rights restricting content filtering tools and invasive techniques to snoop network traffic called deep packet inspections (DPIs). What was really disturbing is that the basis for most of their submissions were on two particularly unfortunate arguments:\n First, the net neutrality principle was ill-suited in the context of next-generation access technologies like 5G. In fact, they linked the government’s decision to implement the net neutrality principle with future investments in 5G. Second, that current legal systems work well enough since there have been no net neutrality violations in the ecosystem since the amendments.  Responding to this our counter comments reminded TRAI that another key aspect of internet governance is ensuring the advance of people’s right to receive and impart information, the ability to exchange ideas, competition, overall diversity and plurality. Keeping this in mind IFF represented the following points:\n TRAI should narrow loopholes like the definition of reasonable traffic management practices and specialised services. This will prevent internet providers from abusing regulatory exceptions to discriminate against certain types of internet traffic to the detriment of internet users. Light touch regulations should be discarded. Strong enforcement is needed since telecom operators are acting in this sphere with impunity at this stage. TRAI should not fall for the 5G red herring and create wide exceptions in the favour of providers for a technology which is a ways away from rollout. Monitoring and assessment should be done with the help of technical tools since it can help with objective benchmarking and investigations. TRAI must recommend an inclusive multistakeholder body which prevents industry capture, and helps raise institutional capacity within the state to catch and punish net neutrality violations.  TRAI’s Open House Discussion\u0026ndash; Professor van Schewick’s Contributions were Invaluable On June 24, 2020 TRAI took the initiative to host a virtual open house discussion on the matter at hand. IFF was among the stakeholders present and intervened along the lines of our earlier submissions. In general, the discussion largely replicated stakeholder positions detailed earlier. However, the interventions by Professor Barbara van Schewick were particularly instructive.\nProfessor van Schewick clearly outlined the importance of holding network management practices by internet operators accountable. This is because it is this layer of regulation which determines people’s experience of the internet between 5PM and midnight\u0026ndash; time periods where most people use the internet. Professor van Schewick advocated the need for traffic management must be controlled in a manner which keeps the internet as non-discriminatory and open as possible.\nTo achieve this she proposed India follow the precedent set in jurisdictions like Canada and Europe which mandate traffic management remains as application agnostic as possible. In addition a restriction must only be considered valid if it aims to address network congestion. She also highlighted that regulation should not legitimise class-based traffic management practices. This is because from a technical perspective, despite the best of intentions, the internet was not built to identify applications. Professor van Schewick stressed that in practice such a governance approach leads to discriminatory and non competitive outcomes which hamper user choice and distorts innovation decisions.\nProfessor van Schewick also offered a lucid intervention which took apart the notion that TRAI should relax net neutrality thresholds for 5G innovations. She clarified this by stating that 5G offers increased network capacity and faster speeds. In essence, 5G reduces the need for discrimination. In her explanation about reconciling innovation and 5G she discussed innovation in the realm of network slicing. Critically, she touched upon a key pillar of net neutrality i.e. user centricity.\nIn this context, she highlighted that regulations like net neutrality in domains like network slicing \u0026amp; 5G. may be shaped by user needs and preferences. In essence 5G innovations in domains like network slicing and software defined networks can be linked to market/user demand, and the net neutrality principle is perfectly aligned with this.\nIn a later intervention, Professor van Schewick again stressed on the importance of public centricity and user participation. She stressed that it is critical that the implementation of traffic management rules are enforced with sufficient and the widest possible public participation.\nIFF’s Supplementary Submission Taking a cue from these prescient observations IFF filed a supplementary submission in order to offer sufficient public and user-side perspectives. Our submission highlights that it is essential that TRAI and DoT ensure the enforcement framework discharges the intended objectives of net neutrality. Specifically, they must ensure the benefits of the amendment percolate down to citizens and emerging entrepreneurs. For this the Government and the telecom regulator must not allow for industry to use ancillary components of the conversation like future networking innovations to revisit settled debates around the net neutrality principle.\nInstead, TRAI and the Government would be well served if they focus on installing suitable implementation mechanisms. In our submission we address the importance of:\n Providing Strong Institutional Mechanisms for Public Complaints, Awareness and Participation. This requires ensuring that an advisory multistakeholder body is designed in a manner which serves the public interest and mitigates risks of it becoming cornered by large licensed and industry participants. To ward off such risks we proposed TRAI consider passing an overarching regulatory framework. We also highlighted the importance of government interventions to drive public awareness and participation in the framework. For this we highlighted, our own experiences documenting alleged net neutrality violations by internet operators. To read more about these experiences you may read these blog posts here, here, and here. Our supplementary submission even highlights that IFF has written in March and May, 2019 to both TRAI and the Department of Telecommunications (“DoT”) to take notice of the matter and accelerate work towards implementation and enforcement; to add heft to the net neutrality licensing amendments. Keeping these experiences in mind, we emphasised the importance of ensuring that the consumers must be able to have appropriate avenues to register complaints. In particular it is important that India establishes a mechanism for user-side feedback loops. Authorities must determine what is more effective in raising user participation, i.e whether feedback/complaint systems are built and operationalised internally or externally. Appropriate forums which engage frequently and meaningfully with end-users, who establish trust with these constituents can be leveraged by Indian authorities towards these complaint/feedback objectives. Additionally, it is imperative TRAI and DoT implement technical tools which empower users and reduce information asymmetries. Here, there remains a distinction between website blocking and other types of net neutrality violations. Throttling and technical prioritisation is less visceral than website blocking. For this India needs to empower users and external researchers with easy-to-use tools which can detect irregular degradation of performance by internet access providers. Finally, among other things, our response stressed on the fact that unlike the representations made by internet access providers net neutrality does not hinder innovation even in domains like 5G. Therefore, any exceptions to the principle must be streamlined and defined in a narrow manner. We also urged TRAI to categorically outlaw the use of deep packet inspections (“DPIs”) and content filtering/parental control tools.  What’s Next? We will continue to follow up with TRAI and DoT, and ensure net neutrality is meaningfully implemented. After this we will work towards ensuring that the ecosystem can allow for you to formally register complaints with authorities. Second, we will work towards transparency. This includes suitable disclosure making norms and ensuring that you are provided with technical tools which can be used dynamically to monitor your internet providers activities.\nIn the meantime please feel free to report to us any perceived violations by your internet provider in this reporting form here.\nImportant Documents  Our supplementary submission dated June 29, 2020 to TRAI on the consultation paper on TMPs and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality (link) Our initial comments to the consultation paper dated February 13, 2020 (link) Our counter comments to the consultation paper dated February 27, 2020 (link) IFF’s analysis of TRAI’s consultation paper on TMPs and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality (link) Read more about our work documenting non-compliance by internet access providers with their net neutrality obligations (link, link and link) Report a net neutrality violation (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/iff-writes-to-trai-reminding-them-that-users-must-be-at-the-centre-of-net-neutrality-savetheinternet/","summary":"On June 29, 2020 IFF has shared a supplementary submission with TRAI on net neutrality monitoring and enforcement.

This data was part of the MoRTH’s Vahan and Sarathi databases that contain sensitive details related to the citizens’ Vehicle Registration Certificates (RC) and Driving Licences (DL). While we acknowledge that this is a forward-thinking step aimed in the right direction, we also made a case that more loopholes need to be plugged, and more changes need to be incorporated to secure the citizens’ privacy and security in a more foolproof manner. So, we wrote to the Ministry highlighting critical steps as we move forward towards more complete privacy and security.\nThe Background The Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) holds citizen records as part of their issuance of Vehicle Registration Certificates and Driving Licences under their Vahan and Sarathi databases, or together referred to as Parivahan. In March 2019, the ministry decided to monetise this data by selling it to research and commercial institutions as part of their Bulk Data Sharing Policy (2019). While this mostly held non-personal details like chassis number, model type, year of manufacture among others, the MoRTH itself admitted that this data could be subject to Triangulation. Triangulation refers to the combination of different data-sets, which individually do not reveal much but viewing them together could lead to individual identification, and dilution of privacy. However, the policy did not provide any measures against triangulation, and simply placed the burden on the business/entity buying the data.\nMaking this worse is the fact that personal data like owner’s name and recent traffic violations can be accessed freely by anyone via the MoRTH’s Parivahan website, and mParivahan mobile app. Hence, it was not surprising that in February during the unrest in New Delhi, reports started coming in, which claimed that miscreants were using these easily accessible databases to target vehicles owned by the people of religious minorities.\nIFF had reacted immediately and written to the ministry highlighting all the problems plaguing this practice of selling citizens’ data, and its lack of foresight in making personal information like name and traffic violation records freely available for malicious agents to exploit. We had summarised our stance and efforts in this blog post dated 26 February, 2020. Soon after, a few ministry officials had informed the media that the MoRTH was working to partially conceal the names of the owners on these databases.\nBulk Data Sharing Policy SCRAPPED! But the victory is still incomplete! The Apex Committee of the MoRTH met on 4 June, 2020 to deliberate mainly on the privacy and security issues arising from the Bulk Data Sharing Policy. It was unanimously decided that selling of Vahan and Sarathi data to businesses can be prone to misuse. The basis of this reasoning resulted in scrapping the policy and we were pleased to know . We were also happy to note that the committee realises that such personal and sensitive data is not fit for sharing even through reports, and it is committed to complying with the Data Protection when it is legislated.However, there are few issues that arise as a consequence of the topics discussed, and the proposals made during the meeting. Here are the major loopholes that we have identified, which need to be plugged to ensure that this step towards honouring the privacy of the citizens is fully realised. Hence, we called upon the MoRTH to take note of these issues and made a case as to why each of them is critical:\n Preventing accumulation of personal data through government proxies: The Committee decided that ‘the non-personal anonymized vehicle data available in the National Register be provided free of cost as a bulk data on considering such requests from reputed public research institutions / educational institutions, which are controlled by the Central Government or the State Governments. Further, such institutions shall share the study / research findings to the Ministry and that the institutions shall not further share the data to other organizations’ Here adequate measures should be taken to prevent private use through such bodies which may be used as proxies. It should be considered that a lot of research projects at both dedicated research institutions as well as educational institutions are funded by private funders and organisations. In this case, the sanctity of the data can not be ensured since the institute would invariably be sharing this bulk data with these private funders, directly or indirectly through reports. Therefore, we feel that simply giving data access to publicly funded institutions will not solve the problem as the data will still remain prone to misuse. We recommend proper transparency and accountability mechanisms even when data is shared with Central Government or State Government entities. Definition and risks of sharing, ‘non personalised anonymised vehicle data’: We made a case that while removing personal identifiers like name and address does make the data anonymised, this can easily countered by a process called Triangulation as acknowledged itself in the Bulk Data Sharing Policy. Triangulation means the combination of different datasets which individually do not reveal much but viewing them together could lead to individual identification, and dilution of privacy. Given that personal details like owner’s name and traffic violation data are so readily available for public access on the Parivahan database, simply anonymising this data at one place will not solve any purpose until measures are put in place that prevent the possibility of triangulation. Here, we recommended instituting specific studies and risk assessments prior to the sharing of any such data with a focus on definition of what specifically constitutes, “non personal anonymised vehicle data”. Follow up steps for ensuring deletion of data shared: The Committee remarked that, ‘it was further clarified that since the existence of the Bulk Data Sharing Policy at a cost, only a single request for the requirement of Bulk Data is being processed in the Ministry, but the application has not been accepted till date by the Ministry and is pending’. However, an answer to the Unstarred Question No. 1698 in the Rajya Sabha dated 8 July, 2019 reveals that the ministry sold bulk data stored in its Vahan and Sarathi databases to 32 government entities and 87 private entities since the inception of the policy in March 2019. Furthermore, this RTI reply [link] suggests that as of 1 August, 2019, at least 142 entities bought vehicle and licence data from the ministry. Therefore, we urged the ministry to verify this and duly state what is the current situation as this discontinuity in information is giving rise to a lot of confusion. And, in case the data is still held by other entities, we recommended that the government needs to ensure that this data is duly deleted. Our recommendation is that these entities should be made to sign an undertaking on an affidavit claiming the deletion of the datasets countersigned by their statutory auditors. This will ensure that misuse and mishandling of the data is prevented. Parivahan Website and Mobile Apps: While scraping the Bulk Data Sharing Policy is a a very positive step, any positive outcomes would be nullified as long as personal and sensitive data like vehicle owner’s name and traffic rule violations can be freely, and quickly accessed via the Parivahan websites and mobile apps. We strongly believe that the names and traffic violations data can be removed from these platforms without affecting the functionality of the app and the website. Making sensitive data like this so easily accessible has very dangerous implications for security and privacy. This was evidenced during the state-wide unrest in Delhi in the month of February when unverified reports came out on social media that malicious agents identified individuals from religious minorities and damaged their vehicles, using the data from the Parivahan database. We, therefore, urged the ministry to remove the names of the owners and traffic violation data from the Parivahan database.  Additionally, the Apex Committee decided that a special committee comprising JS (MVL, MoRTH), Director (MVL,MoRTH), Shri Joydeep Shome, DDG (NIC) and Smt. Yagnapriya Bharath, CGM (IRDAI) shall be constituted to finalise structure, standardisation and mechanism for sharing of reports in public domain, through the portal. Here, we urged the Honourable Minister to make this process deliberative and participatory. We believe that the decision on the process of sharing these reports should involve all possible stakeholders like citizens, civil society members, digital rights organisations, traffic, security and technology experts among others so that both the process and decision are inclusive and well-informed. Today, fellow Indians and civil society organisations are eager to assist the Government in participatory rule-making to ensure individual liberty, social justice and the imperatives of good governance.\nImportant Links\n Our letter to the MoRTH dated 29 June, 2020.

We are issuing a joint statement supporting this action alongwith Rethink Aadhaar, Article 21 and Swathanthra Malayalam Computing.\nJoint Statement The joint statement prepared by RethinkAadhaar in english is given below. A malayalam version has also been prepared by Anivar Aravind from Swathanthra Malayalam Computing for circulation. All relevant documents, such as the legal notice by Kalyani Menon Sen are also available at the end as links.\n \u0026ldquo;Kalyani Menon Sen, a citizen, and petitioner in the batch of writ petitions challenging the constitutionality of Aadhaar in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India (2019 10 SCC 1) has sent the Government of Kerala a legal notice demanding that it withdraw a recent order mandating compulsory Aadhaar verification for all new applicants and recent appointees to state government jobs. Internet Freedom Foundation, Rethink Aadhaar, Article 21 and Swathanthra Malayalam Computing endorse this legal notice, and call on the Kerala Government to withdraw this order.\n  The order dated 11.06.2020, which was issued by the Kerala Government\u0026rsquo;s Department of Personnel \u0026amp; Administrative Reforms, relates to applicants and new appointments to the Kerala Public Service Commission. As Ms. Menon Sen\u0026rsquo;s legal notice notes, mandating Aadhaar verification for new appointees and applicants violates the order of the Supreme Court relating to Aadhaar, KS Puttaswamy v Union of India (2019 10 SCC 1).\n  The 5 judge bench specified that mandating the use of Aadhaar numbers, whether for verification or any other purpose, was constitutionally valid for two purposes only: for linking with PAN numbers, and for obtaining welfare benefits in the nature of a subsidy which is funded from the Consolidated Fund of India. The Hon’ble Supreme Court also read down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act (as it then stood), and specified that the State could use Aadhaar only if it met the following two conditions: that such use was voluntary, and that such use was covered by primary legislation for that purpose.\n  The purpose of preventing fraud cannot and should not be carried out by breaches to privacy, dignity and autonomy of individuals, especially in the absence of any clear basis in law. As a constitutional body, the Government of Kerala, and the KPSC are bound to uphold the rule of law and the judgements of the Supreme Court, and should withdraw the notification, and clarify that Aadhaar verification remains optional.\u0026rdquo;\n   \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Aadhaar Balak\u0026rdquo; credits to Research \u0026amp; Action.

We have after September, 2018 been able to utilise growing capacity through dedicated staff to more actively engage on issues of privacy, surveillance and digital identity. Specifically towards Aadhaar this has meant some strategic litigation before the High Court of Madras, and we have cautioned against the possibility of Aadhaar linking with the National Population Register.\nIFF believes that any digital technology should lead to greater human freedom that is achieved through individual liberty and social justice.

We are making them available online as they form an essential resource for the public and researchers. As per our initial analysis a majority of website blocking being done due to copyright claims and court orders.\nPublic Disclosure : reducing secrecy and opacity Website blocking is a complex issue which seems to be growing in severity only with time. Ordinary Indians who access the internet \u0026mdash; which is a public resource \u0026ndash; still do not know the reason why a specific website is blocked. Sometimes, even the persons who run these websites do not have knowledge as to the reasons and the legal authority which has directed the blocking of websites.\nWe have earlier explained the legal position in respect of porn websites, how sometimes blocking is inconsistently done at the ISP level, and done a preliminary analysis of the several orders we had received through RTIs. Our continuing attempts to increase transparency around this issue received a boost. A whistleblower has provided orders sent by courts and government authorities to Internet Service Providers across India. These contain more than 64 documents and provide explanations for the blocking of about 4398 websites. Today we are publishing them for public knowledge and the wider research community.\nPreliminary inferences We have three preliminary inferences to share on these orders. While offering these inferences we would like to point out that this is a limited data set and is likely to display a bias given the total data field of all blocking orders is not publicly available. At the same time we find value in providing an initial analysis that confirms several points on the reasons for blocking, or the more recent instance of how the WeTransfer block was effected without proper transparency.\n Courts are primary actors: The public authorities from which most of these orders arise are from courts situated in Delhi and Chennai. This is principally the High Court of Delhi and the High Court of Madras. The nature of the orders are interim injunctions on claims by content owners. Here quite often file sharing and movie streaming websites are being blocked. Here processes for specific takedowns on URLs is not the preferred route but entire websites are blocked. A casual read through the list of URLs confirms this. Website blocking is inconsistent: Internet users all across India who use different ISPs have very different experiences on website blocking. This may be due to the technology used, the nature of blocking that is affected and varies from each ISPs compliance in each specific region where they may be offering services through a different technical infrastructure. This is specifically through Document No. 59 which is a non-compliance report in which correspondence was specifically directed to ISPs to block websites in terms of an earlier order. Lack of opposition and transparency: Despite the large impression carried that a majority of blocking orders are affected by Government, as stated these primarily occur through infringement claims made by private parties. In most of these cases the defendants are a few websites, ISPs and Government Departments. It is not clear whether any opposition is presented and whether a high level of scrutiny is visited prior to the directions for blocking being made. While many of such claims may be legitimate there do exist legitimate arguments on proportionality and how over-broad intellectual property enforcement results in deprivations of the public’s right to access materials online. This issue is further compounded by the insufficient notice to people as there does not exist any central, or government repository for housing and publishing their directions for blocking websites.  The Tanul Thakur Case We have identified that it is a lack of proactive publication and transparency in India’s blocking process whether through courts or executive bodies which is causing a fracture of public trust in the exercise of this power. At present there is a writ petition pending before the High Court of Delhi regarding the blocking of the satirical website, “Dowry Calculator”.\nWe have been working with Tanul Thakur, the petitioner and the creator of this website since May, 2019 with drafting and filing RTI applications and we also assisted with the writ petition. Our hope through this intervention is that it helps support greater transparency and the norms of proper notice to website creators, hearings in which they can put forward a defence followed by a public disclosure of the decision. You can read more about this case here, from when notice was first issued, to the stand taken by the government.

As a next step, we have written to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Department of Telecommunications highlighting the prevalent issues and providing certain recommendations. The main recommendations include the swift operationalisation of the CANI Project by the USOF division as well as providing the people of the islands with subsidies to ease the exorbitant tariffs that they are paying currently.\nWe wrote to the PMO and the DoT\nAs highlighted in our previous post on the subject, the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands currently do not have access to high-speed 4G internet. This is because internet and telecommunication services in the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands are presently dependent on satellite connectivity and have access to limited bandwidth. This has led to unreliable internet connectivity as well as extremely high tariffs with one individual getting a bill of 54,902 INR for their broadband connection. Such figures are unfathomable considering how affordable prepaid and postpaid plans for unlimited voice, SMS and data services have become commonplace in India, in the last 4 years.\nThese difficulties were going to be solved by the Chennai and Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project however commission of this project has been consistently delayed. This means that even though the two segments are ready to be operationalised they have not been put into a working condition as of yet. The reasons provided are that initially the commissioning of these two segments got delayed due to the cyclone Amphan which hit Eastern India in May, 2020. Post this, the reason for the delay is said to be the COVID-19 lockdown with the timeline for the project now being extended a further six months.\nTherefore we wrote to the PMO and the DoT highlighting the plight of the people of the islands and made the following recommendations:\n The USOF division of the DoT must implement the CANI project according to pre-existing timelines, and if they are not able to do so they must make public the reasons for this. They should also then provide clear timelines in which they estimate the work will be completed. This should include an explicit last date by when the project is complete and a detailed timeline with expected benchmarks. BSNL and NEC must highlight if they face any regulatory hurdles, so that those can be worked on by the DoT and the USOF division, BSNL and local municipal authorities. Segments 1 and 6, which are ready for operationalisation according to DoT circular no. 30-174-7/2015-USOF-BB(Vol.IX) dated 24.04.2020, must start their trial period by commencing traffic testing. Any permission related hurdles which delay compliance must be resolved by the DoT expeditiously. Since internet and telecom services are categorised as “essential services” in various government orders therefore this issue must be given that level of importance by both central (DoT) and local authorities (BSNL, Andaman). In the interim, vulnerable populations should be provided with subsidised broad based internet based services/transaction opportunities at CSCs, kiosks, post offices, legal services authorities, cyber cafes, etc. Funds should also be allocated under USOF and national/state disaster relief funds for subsidised access to internet connectivity and internet enabled devices. This includes suitable subsidies for all current BSNL users on the islands. Special subsidies can be designed for students, healthcare workers and senior citizens.  Hear it from the people of the islands themselves\nIn the video below, we have collected accounts from the people of the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar islands themselves who have detailed the difficulties that they are facing due to lack of access to fast, reliable and affordable internet services.\n4G v. 2G\nIn the video below, at 09:10 mark, Prateek Waghre from the Takshashila Institute explains how 2G speeds are especially harmful during the COVID-19 pandemic. This video was made in the context of the internet shutdowns in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and we urge you to watch it in its entirety if you have the time.\nOn June 25, 2020, in an interview given by the CGM of BSNL, Andaman, it was disclosed that the migration to bandwidth from the CANI Project will start from July 1, 2020 in and around Port Blair and will take around 15 days to be completed. He said that 4G speeds will not be available due to non-availability of spectrum. Further, he said that high speed internet services in other parts of the islands are likely to begin from September, 2020 as per BSNL targets but may be further delayed due the pandemic. Most importantly, he revealed that there will be no change in the exorbitant tariffs which are currently being charged.

A joint report by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab has reported on how a Spyware software was used to spy on various Indian civil rights activists, journalists and lawyers. Another study by Citizen Lab brings to light the presence of a New Delhi-based hacking firm that has targeted advocacy groups, journalists, elected government officials, and multiple industries on six continents. More credence is lent to such claims, now that the MeitY’s own nodal agency, CERT-in has come out with an advisory warning people about an impending large-scale email phishing attack in major Indian cities. Amidst such blatant attacks against privacy, autonomy, and liberty, we wrote to the Committee on IT to take note of these important developments. We also wrote to the Hon’ble Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Hon’ble Chairman of the Rajya Sabha making a case that moving legislative business to virtual platforms is not only urgent, but that the existing rules can be used to easily make this change.\nWell, what is “Phishing” and “Spyware”? We know you probably know that, “phishing”, and, “spyware” attacks are something to guard against but what are they exactly? Also, why are they such a grave threat to your cyber security and privacy?\n Phishing or Spearphishing is defined by Kaspersky as, ‘an email or electronic communications scam targeted towards a specific individual, organization or business. Although often intended to steal data for malicious purposes, cybercriminals may also intend to install malware on a targeted user’s computer’. In other words, it is a fraudulent technique through which the receiver of an electronic message like an email or a message is made to visit a fraudulent website by clicking a link. Through this they may be tricked into divulging sensitive information like passwords, financial information and other personal information. This can take place either directly, through fake versions of popular websites like Twitter, Facebook or Google or indirectly, through deployment of a Spyware software that secretly gets installed on the victim’s system via this link.Spyware is defined as, ‘software that’s designed to gather data from a computer or other device and forward it to a third party without the consent or knowledge of the user. This often includes collecting confidential data such as passwords, PINs and credit card numbers, monitoring keyword strokes, tracking browsing habits and harvesting email addresses.’ Simply put, it is a family of softwares aimed at stealing information about a person or a group of persons without their knowledge and sending it to another entity. Spyware often operates by gaining control of the victim’s computer without consent and then relaying gathered information like internet activity data and passwords via cookies, which are usually consented for. Phishing and Spyware can work in tandem– a phishing email can lead to the installation of a spyware software on the victims’ computers.  Massive Cybersecurity Threats in India Over the past few weeks two international organisations – Amnesty International, and Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary research group at the University of Toronto, Canada have published detailed reports establishing a concrete idea about the serious nature of cybersecurity threats, and data privacy breaches that the country is facing.\n Cyber Attack on the Bhima Koregaon 11 : First one of these is a joint report by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab detailing how a commercially available Spyware called NetWire was deployed via phishing emails to spy on 9 civil rights activists, journalists and lawyers. Their computer systems were hacked into to monitor their actions and communications, which is a direct violation of their right to freedom of expression, and the right to privacy guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. Incidentally, 8 of the 9 victims of this spyware attack have been demanding the release of the Bhima Koregaon 11, a group of human and social rights activists currently under arrest amidst a pending trial. Furthermore, at least 3 of these 9 victims were also targeted by the widely discussed NSO’s Pegasus spyware in 2019. A homegrown blackhat phishing firm: Second is an investigative report by Citizen Lab revealing the presence of an internationally active hacking firm in New Delhi. This firm, named BellTroX InfoTech Services has been mentioned in the report in relation to providing services to clients that aimed at hacking individuals, organisations and industrial entities on six continents. It has been reported that these victims include advocacy groups and journalists, elected and senior government officials, hedge funds, and multiple industries. More specifically, the group was behind the phishing of organizations working on net neutrality advocacy. Also, American organisations working on the #ExxonKnew campaign, which claimed that Exxon Mobil held back evidence on climate change and global warming for decades were targeted by BellTroX. You could be next: The serious implications of these findings gain more credence in light of an advisory (CIAD-2020-0040, dated 19 June 2020) by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), an official government agency, which asserts that nearly 2 million Indian email addresses are vulnerable to an impending phishing attack. It is suggested that such an attack can be carried out under the pretext of providing receivers help by posing as ‘\u0026hellip;government agencies, departments, and trade associations who have been tasked to oversee the disbursement of government fiscal aid’. Added to this is the fact that the email might be from an ‘official sounding’ email address like ‘ncov2019@gov.in’, which makes it even more dangerous and harmful for the citizens.  Here is what the malicious email can look like:\n  It is clear that such cybersecurity threats, which clearly put the privacy, security, and freedom of expression of the citizens at risk, cannot be treated as rare incidents anymore and need to be dealt with with a robust framework in place.\nTherefore, IFF sent a letter to the members of the Parliamentary Committee on IT requesting them to take note of these recent findings and urging them to further the cause of restoring legislative business through virtual committee meetings. However, it does not help that there is a severe lack of legislative discussion around these issues. Furthermore, the possibility of such a discussion has been stymied by the fact that the Parliament has been reluctant in adopting remote conferencing platforms for carrying out legislative business, especially the standing committee meetings.\nAbsence of Legislative Action The urgent need for Parliamentary debate on such issues that directly endanger autonomy, privacy and liberty of all Indian citizens is an undeniable fact.\nWe were disappointed to know that the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on Information Technology, which was scheduled to be held on 10 June, 2020 was called off by the Hon’ble Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Even though in-person attendance could not have been ensured amidst the rising cases of COVID-19, the reluctance in adapting to remote conference technologies is disappointing.\nRegarding this, the Hon’ble Chairperson of the Committee on IT, Dr. Shashi Tharoor tweeted (quoting the Hon’ble Speaker) that the meeting cannot be held virtually without the rules being amended, in a process that involves agreement of the Rules Committee and a vote in the House.\nSo, pressing for action, we wrote to the Hon’ble Speaker and the Hon’ble Chairman of the Rajya Sabha making a case that the corresponding Rules of Procedure and Business do provide enough power to the Hon’ble Speaker and the Hon’ble Chairman to constitute these changes, if they will.\nWe pointed out that specifically, Rule 331K of the Rules and Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha and Rules 275 and 81 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States do pave way for adoption of remote conferencing tools with their consent.\nWe, at IFF, believe that as the world’s largest democracy and one of the biggest powerhouses in Information Technology, India has both the reason and the technical know-how to effortlessly bring this change to fruition. The reason for pushing for this transition becomes even stronger when such pressing issues like autonomy, dignity, privacy and freedom of expression are at stake. It is also interesting to consider that countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil and New Zealand among others have duly incorporated online conferencing tools to conduct their legislative business. This fact has been highlighted well in these Op-eds by M.R. Madhavan and Chakshu Roy, the President, and the Head of Civic and Legislative Engagement at PRS, respectively.We intend to follow up and will keep urging all our parliamentary institutions to take clear steps to protect your digital rights.\nImportant Links   Our representation to the Standing Committee on Information Technology highlighting evidence on recently uncovered cybersecurity and privacy threats in the country dated 23 June 2020.

On May 5, 2020 the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MCA) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) allowed the use of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) or Drones by government entities for COVID-19 related operations by issuing a conditional exemption under Rule 160 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Under this conditional exemption, government entities are allowed to deploy drones to conduct aerial surveillance, aerial photography and public announcements related to COVID-19. We wrote to the MCA and DGCA asking them to recall the conditional exemption and to commence an investigation into the ongoing illegal use of drones by the Delhi Police for mass surveillance.\nIllegal use of drones by the Delhi Police\nIllegal use of drones by the Delhi Police first came to our attention in December, 2019 when the Delhi Police used them to surveill the protests that took place in the city. As a result, we sent a legal notice dated December 27, 2019 (Ref. No. 143/2019) to the DGCA on the illegal use of drones by the Delhi Police. In the legal notice, we asked the DGCA to seek independent legal opinion on the legality of drone use by the police, conduct an investigation into the ongoing use of drones by the Delhi Police and to take interim steps including sending an advisory to all Director General of Police about the CAR compliances for operating drones.\nHowever, in February, 2020 we again came across reports that the Delhi Police had used drones to “monitor the situation” during the riots in North-East Delhi. As a result, we filed Right to Information requests (RTI Reference No. DEPOL/R/E/20/01005 dated February 14, 2020) with the Delhi Police asking them about their use of drones. Subsequently, in response (No.953/RTI Cell/North East District dated March 13, 2020) the North-East District, Seelampur division of the Delhi Police disclosed that they have been hiring drones from the open market through their Station House Officers (SHO). According to the response received, the purpose of hiring drones was to maintain law and order. Again we urged the Delhi Police to either to make any guidelines which allow and regulate use of drones by the police, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urged the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. (Read our blogpost containing an analysis of the Delhi Police RTI response here)\nMCA \u0026amp; DGCA have introduced conditional exemptions for Government Authorities for COVID-19 surveillance\nThe MCA \u0026amp; DGCA have now allowed the use of drones by government entities for COVID-19 related operations by issuing a conditional exemption under Rule 160 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937 dated May 2, 2020. Under this conditional exemption, government entities are allowed to deploy drones to conduct aerial surveillance, aerial photography and public announcements related to COVID-19.\nAerial surveillance, as allowed by conditional exemption mentioned hereinabove, is violative of the decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India. This is because the intrusion which will be made by such use of drones into the privacy of individuals is disproportionate to the objective for which the step is being taken. Surveillance of COVID-19 patients is being done by the Government through various alternative measures such as contact tracing as well by serosurveillance which has commenced in the country. Aerial surveillance is thus an unnecessary and intrusive measure which will only create and further the threat and anxiety of mass surveillance in the country.\nRecommendations by IFF\nRecently, the Paris-based Conseil d’Etat (No.s 440442, 440445 dated May 18, 2020) banned drone surveillance by the Paris police for tracking people in public areas who were flouting social distancing norms as it was held to be against principles of privacy. It was held that such surveillance cannot be permitted until a privacy-friendly law is put in place or the drones are equipped with such technology that would make it impossible for the police to identify people through drone footage. Similarly, in the absence of a data protection law in India, allowing such surveillance would lead to disproportionate intrusion into the privacy of individuals.\nTherefore, we recommend that:\n The conditional exemption to utilise drones for surveillance should be recalled. An independent privacy impact assessment should be conducted by the DGCA before granting permission to any government authority under the conditional exemption. The DGCA should institute an investigation into the illegal use of drones for mass surveillance by departments such as the Delhi Police. No retrospective sanction should be made for any illegal actions including those by the Delhi Police through the now notified rules.

In its current form, this tender and the proposed project are an unconstitutional and illegal violation of privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of association of citizens, and it must be halted immediately.\nBackground On 13.05.2020, Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL) released a tender for procurement of ‘Solution and Services related to fact verification and disinformation detection.’ As per the tender documents, the scope of work for the project includes:\n Detecting and analyzing coordinated disinformation campaigns. Identifying key influencers behind disinformation and their geographical location. Carrying out link analysis between different entities spreading fake news. Sentiment analysis for large scale disinformation. Monitoring activities of individuals who upload disinformation across social media platforms. Rapid verification of claims and images through an Artificial Intelligence and machine learning based tool. Creating corrective responses with accurate facts. Establishing an archive for long term retention of data.  These proposed features raise concerns about mass surveillance and could have a chilling effect on online speech. Due to advancement in technology and decrease in marginal costs, it is now possible for governments to monitor the social media activity of millions of citizens without their knowledge or consent. The kind of social media monitoring tool that BECIL seeks to procure would collect and process personal data of users from social media platforms and then use automated technology like artificial intelligence to aggregate, organize and analyse the large amount of data collected. While we share the government’s concern about misinformation which is a genuine and serious problem, we maintain that mass surveillance of millions of Indian internet users without any legal safeguards is not a proportionate solution.\nDigital India should not become a Digital Panopticon In today’s world, people share a large amount of information on social media platforms about their political views, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental health etc. For this reason, some companies like Facebook and Twitter prohibit automated scraping of data from their platform without prior written permission of the company. When individuals share sensitive personal information with their friends, family and followers, they cannot reasonably foresee that such information will be collected from their social media profile by government agencies and stored indefinitely.\nFurther, there exists a real risk of harm because sensitive personal information collected from social media platforms will be processed by opaque algorithms to build a probabilistic profile of the individual which can make the person a target for law enforcement agencies. In this context, it is pertinent to note that any profiling based on social media activity is particularly susceptible to misinterpretation because the use of likes, shares or hashtags may not represent endorsement. Therefore, individuals could be wrongly classified as disinformation spreaders by algorithms.\nFinally, the data which is used to train artificial intelligence and machine learning tools will determine what information is considered true or false by these tools. Therefore, if the training data is flawed or biased, it could lead to discriminatory censorship of particular groups.\nViolation of Fundamental Rights of Internet Users Legality: At present, India does not have a data protection legislation in place to regulate tools such as those sought to be procured by BECIL via the tender. In the absence of any underlying data protection legislation, Indian internet users do not have any mechanism to seek deletion, modification or correction of their data, remedy for misuse of their data or remedy for miscategorization by opaque algorithms. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has consistently held that restrictions on fundamental rights can only be imposed through a statutory provision or rule. Therefore, in the absence of a general data protection law, a specific legislation must be enacted to provide a legal basis to the tender.Privacy: In 2017, a 9 judge bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1) unanimously held that privacy was a fundamental right under the Constitution of India. In fact, Kaul J.’s opinion in the case explicitly recognized that there may exist a reasonable expectation of privacy even over social media posts in the following words: “If the posting on social media websites is meant only for a certain audience, which is possible as per tools available, then it cannot be said that all and sundry in public have a right to somehow access that information and make use of it.\u0026quot; Collection and processing of public social media posts is also subject to regulation as noted by the European Court of Justice in Belgische Vereniging van Auteurs, Componisten en Uitgevers CVBA (SABAM) v. Netlog NV, where the Court held that \u0026ldquo;the injunction requiring installation of the contested filtering system would involve the identification, systematic analysis and processing of information connected with the profiles created on the social network by its users. The information connected with those profiles is protected personal data because, in principle, it allows those users to be identified (see, by analogy, Scarlet Extended, paragraph 51).”\nFreedom of Speech \u0026amp; Expression: The fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under Art.19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, and the Hon’ble Supreme Court in **** Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015 5 SCC 1) has held that overbroad restrictions which have a chilling effect on online speech are unconstitutional. The chilling effect of surveillance technologies has also been recognized by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in PUCL v. Union of India ( 1997 1 SCC 301) where the Court held that telephone tapping could infringe freedom of speech and expression since people may feel reluctant to speak under the watchful gaze of the government. Mass surveillance of social media activity will lead to self-censorship by individuals and especially deter disclosure of information by journalists, activists and whistleblowers. Freedom of Association: Social media platforms have helped individuals collectivize and form communities around their shared professional, political, social or cultural interests. Pervasive social media monitoring would undermine the right to form such associations which is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution of India. This is especially relevant since the tender states that vendors must provide a tool which can detect coordinated campaigns and carry out link analysis between different entities.\nIt is worth noting that in 2018, BECIL had sought to create a more ambitious version of this project in the form of a Social Media Communication Hub (Read more here). Thankfully, the Social Media Communication Hub was scrapped after public outrage and litigation before the Supreme Court. The present tender must also meet the same fate since it suffers from similar problems but this will required sustained advocacy by citizens and civil society groups to ensure we do not sleep walk into a surveillance state.\nImportant Documents  Legal Notice to BECIL dated 19.06.2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/legal-notice-becil-tender-social-media-monitoring-tool/","summary":"We sent a legal notice to BECIL against a tender for procurement of fact verification and disinformation detection tools which will lead to mass surveillance of social media users.","title":"Surveillance of social media users is not the solution for fake news #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Licensed Service Area Units of the Department of Telecom sought bulk Call Data Records from Telecom Service Providers as per official documents revealed through RTI. The RTI responses do not support DoT\u0026rsquo;s claim that bulk Call Data Records were only sought for analysing call drops, and they reveal glaring factual inconsistencies and legal deficiencies.\nConcern expressed by AACTI The issue of bulk gathering starts from press reports in the Economic Times and the Indian Express dated March 15, 2020 and March 18, 2020. These news reports indicated that telecom operators wrote to the Department of Telecom (DoT) expressing concerns about surveillance through requisition of bulk Call Data Records (CDRs) by Licensed Service Area (LSA) units. Subsequent to this, we have obtained the text of this letter through a request filed under the Right to Information Act, 2005 .\nOn February 12, 2020 the Apex Advisory Council for Telecom in India (AACTI) wrote to the Ld. Secretary, Department of Telecom in which they highlighted that:\n Sensitivity of CDRs : “Call Data Records (CDRs)\u0026hellip; contain various personal and sensitive information such as MSISDNs, IMSI, IMEI, Location etc….”. This is substantiated by the information sought by Department of Telecom\u0026rsquo;s email dated 15.01.2020 that demands information for 13 fields including, “Calling Party Telephone Number, Called Party Telephone Number, Call Date, Call Time, Call duration (in seconds), Complete First Cell ID, Complete Last Cell ID, Call Type (IN/OUT/SMS_IN/SMS_OUT), IMEI of Party, IMSI of Party, Type of Connection (Pre-paid/Post-paid), SMS Centre Number / GGSN Address/SGSN address, First Roaming Network Circle ID.” Breach of existing SoPs : As per the AACTI, “various SOPs have been issued by the Department of Telecom” dated 04.08.2016 and 02.04.2019 and include, “various provisions like first ascertaining the identity of the subscriber, examining the justification carefully, detailing purpose for seeking CDRs and not using such CDRs received for any other purpose…”. “Various LSA units of DoT are not adhering to this process” and, “almost all LSA units of DoT continue to seek one day CDR details from the Licensee…”. In addition LSA units of DoT units also continue to seek additional CDR details on ad hoc basis. For this instance, CDR details sought on February 2-4, 2020 in Delhi is cited. Violation of privacy: The AACTI cites a lack of justification and purpose limitation by stating that, “neither the intended purpose for requirement of CDRs.. has been provided”. It further states, “CDRs sought for specific routes/areas may lead to allegations of surveillance…. of Ministers, MPs, Judges etc.”.  Statement by DoT Subsequent to this a Press Information Bureau statement dated March 18, 2020 was made by the DoT. The stated justifications proceed on various grounds including the following:\n Big data tool to analyse call drops: “For this purpose, data on calls made from mobiles in any tower coverage area is analysed to ascertain calls terminated within 30 seconds and made again,” the department said. “DoT will be better equipped to take up such cases and areas with the telecom service providers based on actual data. For this purpose, total data of calls made during any particular time period from the identified cell phone tower locations from where the complaints are received is collected to enable analysis,” it added. Data is anonymous: “However, this data is anonymous and does not contain names of either the maker or receiver of calls. There is no infringement of privacy of any person. No personal details are collected. There is no tracking of any phone number.” Further, \u0026ldquo;it has been decided to seek such data only for short time period i.e. three to six hours normally covering the peak load of traffic on the Network for any cell tower.” Legal power and safeguards: “It is further clarified that DoT is empowered under Rule 419 of the Indian Telegraph Rules 1951 to access such anonymous data for improving network quality. Moreover, DoT has also put in place an in house standard operating procedure so that any authorization of such access to call drop data can be approved only by very senior officers.”  RTI requests and answers provided On March 19, 2020 the Internet Freedom Foundation filed RTI requests with various LSA units of the DoT seeking further information why these CDRs were sought. **** The text of the RTI is provided below.\n “The information sought herein relates to the following two news reports - \u0026lsquo;DoT units seeking bulk call data record in routine, telcos raise concern\u0026rsquo; published by the Economic Times on 15 March, 2020 and \u0026lsquo;Cellphone operators red-flag ‘surveillance’ after Govt wants call records of all users\u0026rsquo; published in the Indian Express on March 18, 2020. Please provide information in response to the following queries:\n   Please provide copies of all letters sent by the local departments of the DoT to TSPs from December 2019 to February, 2020 with regard to obtaining call data records including    (a) a full list of all TSPs with whom such directives were filed;\n  (b) all licensed service areas where such requests were made;\n  (c) the dates for which such information was sought; and\n  (d) the duration/time period for which these call data records were sought.\n  Please clarify the enabling legal provision under which the requests for call data records were made.    Please state the official purpose for which such bulk call data records were sought from TSPs    Please provide a copy of the complaint filed by the Cellular Operators Association of India on February 12, 2020 to Mr. Anshu Prakash, Secretary, Department of Telecommunications with regard to these requests to obtain the call data records.”   The responses we received are contained in the following table:\n   LSA Time and Extent of CDR Reasoning and UA License Provision     Haryana All subscribers of all telecom providers for \u0026ldquo;24 hour period of 17.12.2019; 23.01.2020; 28.02.2020 Condition 9, Chapter I and Condition 39.20 of Chapter No. 39.20 and as per answer “Illegal telecom setups” and “find invalid” and “non-genuine” IMEIs   Kolkata “One week call data of Incoming international long distance calls of “all subscribers on RJIO and RCOM” as only “both of them have International Long Distance Gateways in Kolkata” for one week as per email dated 25.02.2020 Sole reliance on DOT Security Letter dated 14.02.2020, “MHA has desired” “future course of action on [illegible] of virtual number”   Kochi All subscribers of all telecom providers for 24 hours of 15.11.2019; 15.12.2019; and 15.01.2020 “For detecting the numbers involved in Grey market telecom activities, for checking IMEI related issues”.   Shillong No CDRs sought No CDRs sought   Pune No CDRs sought No CDRs sought   Patna Proper fees not attached Proper fees not attached    A quick and dirty analysis We have conducted a preliminary analysis of the RTI responses. This analysis is without prejudice to broader legal claims that are pending adjudication before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.\nWithout prejudice to other legal arguments, the following is just a preliminary comment based on comparison of the information from RTI replies with the PIB press release:\n Use case does not match: There is a fundamental mismatch between the DoT press release cited above and the responses received through RTI. The records queried are for a multiplicity of reasons and none of them mention call drops. The stated justifications of the LSAs are varied and diverse. They also draw from legal powers and justifications which are independent of Rule 419 which is not cited in any of the RTI responses or the actual correspondence. Weak claim of anonymity and data limitation: The claims of anonymity are premised on the absence of the name of the subscriber and their residential address. However, the bulk CDRs are sought for all customers with data fields that have at least 13 fields where the inference of the identity of a person is relatively easy. At present mobile numbers are used as an identity field in several e-governance databases. Further, the stated justification of querying information for calls limited to durations of 30 seconds does not match the text of the actual requests. SoPs are not legal and deficient: The SoPs cited have been analysed in the past in a pending litigation filed by the Internet Freedom Foundation, and they are legally deficient and do not constitute as adequate safeguards (link). Further, the bulk requisitioning conflicts with the SoPs. For instance, the bulk collection of CDRs violates the very nature of the SoP safeguards which focus on requisitioning specific and individualised information.  In light of the above, the justifications offered by DoT in the PIB Press Release appear to be a face saving measure which do not hold up on closer scrutiny. As AACTI had noted, some of areas for which bulk CDRs were requisitioned include places where Members of Parliament and Judges reside. This creates a very real possibility of the Executive surveilling other branches of government i.e. the Legislature and Judiciary, which are intended to act as a check on the Executive within our constitutional scheme. In addition to this, bulk CDRs also facilitate mass surveillance of ordinary citizens and enable the government to keep a watch on our everyday interactions. These problems are emblematic of the larger need for surveillance reform in India and it is only through independent oversight that we can ensure the government acts in a transparent and accountable manner.\nImportant Documents  RTI Reply for Haryana (link) RTI Reply for Kolkata (link) RTI Reply for Kochi (link) RTI Reply for Shillong (link) RTI Reply for Pune (link) RTI Reply for Patna (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/bulk-cdr-mass-surveillance/","summary":"RTI responses received by IFF raise concerns about illegal mass surveillance and do not support DoT\u0026rsquo;s claim that bulk Call Data Records were sought for call drop analysis.","title":"Mass Surveillance?

While the right to internet has not been recognized as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India it was held that the internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights. In this blogpost, we aim to highlight the access to internet problems being faced by the citizens of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and how this is affecting them particularly due to the pandemic. In this regard, infrastructural constraints mean the region is languishing with low-speed and prohibitively expensive internet connectivity. Such conditions lead to disproportionate and exclusionary outcomes. In this regard, the pandemic has also delayed the implementation of the Chennai and Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project. The CANI Project is meant to bring high speed broadband connectivity to the inhabitants and was supposed to be completed by June, 2020.\nCurrent Situation in Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands - INR 50,000 for Internet Access! Internet and telecommunication services in the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands are presently dependent on satellite connectivity and have access to limited bandwidth. This has led to unreliable internet connectivity as well as extremely high tariffs with one individual getting a bill of 54,902 INR for their broadband connection. Such figures are unfathomable considering how affordable prepaid and postpaid plans for unlimited voice, SMS and data services have become commonplace in India, in the last 4 years.\nInternet connectivity is shoddy at best with there being no internet from 20th to 22nd May, 2020 due to the Amphan Cyclone. Even when there is internet connectivity, it is slow at best with the combined bandwidth availability for Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands being only 3.2 GBps. For comparison, bandwidth availability in the state of Mizoram is 10 GBps. Individuals on the islands have also complained of highly unstable and below standard connection speed, combined with high latency ranging between 600-1000 ms and packet loss as high as 90% cause failed loading of pages and broken downloads.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation With the implementation of a nation-wide lockdown, people have become heavily dependent on the internet. However due to bad internet connectivity in the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands, the people of the islands have been left handicapped. In a letter to Shri R.S. Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Communications. Electronics \u0026amp; IT, the State President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Shri Ajoy Bairagi listed down the problems which have arisen as a result of bad internet connectivity.\nA. Education\nStudents who are currently in schools and colleges across the country have been accessing their classes and resources online. However, the students in Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands are unable to do so. Additionally, students have not been able to do remote internships or any other skill building exercise. One of the worst affected are college students who are in their final year and have been unable to sit for remote placement interviews due to lack of or unreliable internet connectivity. Students have also not been able to complete online internal and semester end exams which has put them in a disadvantageous position compared to students hailing from other geographical areas who have better internet connectivity. Students who were planning to sit for competitive exams like CAT, GMAT, GATE etc. have also been facing difficulties in preparing for them due to not being able to access online resources. This has created demographic based inequalities with the people of the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands being left in a disadvantageous position.\nB. Online Financial Transactions\nThe lockdown has put the country in the unique position wherein people are reluctant to move outside the protection of their homes. In this situation, online financial services have become indispensable because they allow individuals to carry out online transactions from the security of their homes. However, due to unreliable internet online financial transactions are not feasible. This has forced the people of the island to stand in long queues outside banks and ATMs which is not only highly inconvenient but could also be a possible danger to their well-being.\n**C. Video Conferencing **\nWith restrictions being placed on social and physical contact due to the ongoing pandemic, video conferencing has emerged as one of the foremost ways through which people have been connecting with each other. Video conferencing has become essential not only for those working at home who want to connect with their colleagues but also for relatives and friends as the only means of communication which allows meaningful connection. Mental health issues such as depression and loneliness due to isolation have become high priority concerns.\nOne of the ways through which people around the world have been handling this is through an increase in video conferencing with video conferencing applications such as Zoom averaging 300 million daily meeting participants by the end of April 2020. However, internet connectivity issues have further increased the isolation issues of these islands which are already marginalized from the rest of the country. Other issues which have arisen due to the pandemic and lack of internet connectivity are difficulty in procuring healthcare services, implementation of e-governance initiatives etc.\nThe Chennai and Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project Dependence on satellite connectivity and the problem of limited bandwidth can be solved by the implementation of a submarine communications cable system. A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the seabed between land-based stations to transmit telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean and sea. On January 9, 2020, Shri R.S. Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Communications. Electronics \u0026amp; IT and Law \u0026amp; Justice inaugurated the cable-laying work of the CANI Project. The cables are of four-fibre pairs, with the capacity to transfer 6.4 tera-bytes of data per second by each fibre-pair. At the initial stage of commissioning of the project itself, the islands are supposed to get a data speed of 400-gigabytes per second which is nearly 100 times of the existing capacity.\nThe submarine cables were to be initially laid from Chennai to Port Blair covering a distance of 1,450 kilometres. Afterwards they were to be extended to Rangat, Long Island, Swaraj Island, Hut Bay, Car Nicobar, Kamorta and Campbell Bay in the Union Territory, covering an additional distance of 800 kilometres. The works were expected to be completed by June this year. The total cost of the Project is 1224 Cr INR. This project is being executed by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), Department of Telecommunications(DoT). The USOF aims to provide Universal Service to all areas of the country through network extension \u0026amp; stimulate uptake of the information and communications technology services. Section 3(1A) of Telegraph Act, 1885 defines Universal Service Obligation as :\n Universal Service Obligation\u0026quot; means the obligation to provide access to telegraph services to people in the rural and remote areas at affordable and reasonable prices;\n Japan’s NEC Corporation has been contracted by India’s state-owned telecommunications company Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to design, engineer, supply, install, test and implement the cable system. The project has been divided into eight segments with Segment 1 (Chennai to Port Blair) and Segment 6 (Port Blair to Swaraj Deep erstwhile Havelock) being ready for operationalisation in April, 2020 according to a DoT circular no. 30-174-7/2015-USOF-BB(Vol.IX) dated 24.04.2020.\nHowever, commission of this project has been consistently delayed. This means that even though the two segments are ready to be operationalised they have not been put into a working condition as of yet. The reasons provided are that initially the commissioning of these two segments got delayed due to the cyclone Amphan which hit Eastern India in May, 2020. Post this, the reason for the delay is said to be the COVID-19 lockdown with the timeline for the project now being extended a further six months.\nThe President of the Andaman and Nicobar Bar Association, Shri Mohammed Tabraiz, has filed Writ Petition W.P. No. 5324(W) of 2020, before the Hon’ble High Court of Calcutta, Circuit Bench at Port Blair. The petition seeks to ensure that the Segments 1 and 6 of the CANI Project are operationalised swiftly. The next date of hearing for the matter is on June 11, 2020.\nAccess to Internet is essential The right to access the internet has not yet been recognized as a fundamental right. However, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India it was held that the internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights provided by the Constitution of India. The judgement states that expressing one’s views or conducting one’s business through the internet are protected under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution respectively. However, does the Government have a positive obligation to provide access to the internet?\nThe National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP), 2018 seeks to unlock the transformative power of digital communications networks - to achieve the goal of digital empowerment and improved well-being of the people of India. To this end the NDCP attempts to outline a set of goals, initiatives, strategies and intended policy outcomes. This policy has three missions, the first of which is “Connect India: Creating Robust Digital Communications Infrastructure”. The aim of this mission is to promote Broadband for All as a tool for socio-economic development, while ensuring service quality and environmental sustainability. The CANI Project is a step in the right direction to fulfill this mission since the project aims to increase socio-economic development of the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands due to increase in economic activities including tourism.\n#4GforAll Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a speech given on December 30, 2018 in Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands has said that, “The government is working to ensure that no corner of the country and its people is deprived of development”. However, development in modern times is impossible without access to high-speed internet which is made available at reasonable prices. As seen above, the people of Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands are paying tariffs much higher than the rest of the country and still do not have continued access to the internet.\nThis has put them in a disadvantageous position as compared to the rest of the country. Thus, there is a need for immediate intervention to remedy the situation and prevent it from becoming the root cause of problems which may have long term implications. Internet access is also necessary from a national integration standpoint as it will help in integrating marginalised geographical areas such as the Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar Islands with the rest of the country.\nRecommendations:  The USOF division of the DoT must implement the CANI project according to pre-existing timelines, and if they are not able to do so they must make public the reasons for this. They should also then provide clear timelines in which they estimate the work will be completed. This should include an explicit last date by when the project is complete and a detailed timeline with expected benchmarks. BSNL and NEC must highlight if they face any regulatory hurdles, so that those can be worked on by the DoT and the USOF division, BSNL and local municipal authorities. Segments 1 and 6, which are ready for operationalisation according to DoT circular no. 30-174-7/2015-USOF-BB(Vol.IX) dated 24.04.2020, must start their trial period by commencing traffic testing. Any permission related hurdles which delay compliance must be resolved by the DoT expeditiously. Since internet and telecom services are categorised as “essential services” in various government orders therefore this issue must be given that level of importance by both central (DoT) and local authorities (BSNL, Andaman). In the interim, vulnerable populations should be provided with subsidised broad based internet based services/transaction opportunities at CSCs, kiosks, post offices, legal services authorities, cyber cafes, etc. Funds should also be allocated under USOF and national/state disaster relief funds for subsidised access to internet connectivity and internet enabled devices. This includes suitable subsidies for all current BSNL users on the islands. Special subsidies can be designed for students, healthcare workers and senior citizens.  One avenue through which accountability can be demanded from these government authorities is through the Right to Information Act.\nIFF has been making RTI related interventions as a part of our wider work consistently and we intend to open it up to digital rights researchers and the wider community. If you want IFF to file a RTI request for you please reach out to our Transparency and Right to Information Fellow Anushka Jain via email at policy@internetfreedom.in .\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/for-the-people-of-andaman-nicobar-islands-4g-internet-at-reasonable-tariffs-is-still-a-dream/","summary":"In this blogpost, we aim to highlight the access to internet problems being faced by the citizens of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with a focus on the delays in the ongoing CANI Submarine Cable Systems Project.","title":"For the people of Andaman \u0026 Nicobar Islands, 4G internet at reasonable tariffs is still a dream...  #DigitalAndaman #4GforAll"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Popular file-sharing service service, \u0026ldquo;WeTransfer'' has been blocked by a direction issued by the Department of Telecom (DoT). This has reportedly been done in the interests of, \u0026ldquo;national security and public order\u0026rdquo;. Today, we sent a representation to DoT urging them to recall this direction. We further also indicate the need for wider regulatory reforms that have led to questionable blocking orders in the past. Including the blocking of Telegram and Porn Websites in India. This is at it\u0026rsquo;s very threshold a transparency problem. To address it we are in addition to the representation opening up our RTI resources to the public to facilitate greater transparency.\nWeTransfer blocked WeTransfer is a popular file sharing service (link) used widely in the creative and legal communities in India for sharing large files. It has even been as late as 2017 been used in press releases on the Press Information Bureau by the Ministry of Defence (link) and the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (link).\nToday, we sent a representation to the Department of Telecom to address a direction issued by it to block the popular file sharing web service, “WeTransfer”. This was first reported by Reuters by it’s report dated June 1, 2020, titled, “India asks internet service providers to block WeTransfer” (link). This report was substantiated with several posts on social media by WeTransfer users who further directed us towards a statement by WeTransfer dated on May 27, 2020 (link). To address this specifically, we have taken a range of steps.\nWhen we heard the first press reports on June 1, 2020 itself we filed a RTI.\n  The second step we have taken is to send a detailed representation to both the Department of Telecom and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (link). But more on that later. Through our active community the actual blocking directions was shared with us susbequently. While we cannot at the moment vouch for its authenticity it seems credible to us. The Order first matches all the data points in news reports (also does not contradict them) and second it __ is similar to prior blocking directions which we have studied in the past.\n  Analysis of the WeTransfer Blocking Order It gets a bit technical here, but please bear with us! A short analysis of this blocking dated May 18, 2020 bearing reference number No. 813-7/25/2011-DS-Vol.VII (Part - I) (“the Order”) reveals the following deficiencies :\n Issues of transparency: As a threshold issue, the Order has not been pro-actively published and hence there exists a large amount of confusion amongst the large base of WeTransfer users in India as the website is being inconsistently blocked across ISPs throughout India. Such publication is a necessity not only as per the inferences which follow from the judgement of Shreya Singhal [link at Para 109], but also the directions made by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the judgement of Anuradha Bhasin [link at Para 152(a)] made in the context of directions for suspension of telecom and internet services especially for availing judicial remedies. ****Lack of reasoning: **** The Order does not contain any stated reasons but directs that three URL’s to be blocked. These include two subdomain links which have expired as WeTransfer links for it’s free service makes such links inactive 7 days after creation. The third link is the parent domain of WeTransfer. There is an absence of any reasoning on the material contained on this link or how the service provider itself is in conflict with extant laws and regulations. An absence of any reasoning makes the Order appear mechanical and lacking an application of mind. ****Reliance on UA License: **** That the Order merely cites License Condition 7.12 in Chapter IX of the Unified License (PDF Link). The License Condition states the following, “7.12 In the interest of national security or public interest, the Licensee shall block Internet sites/Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)/Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and / or individual subscribers, as identified and directed by the Licensor from time to time” . It is relevant to consider that provisions for website blocking are also contained under Section 69 of the Information Technology, 2000 with a defined procedure under the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 (“Blocking Rules”) (PDF Link). The blocking rules, provide for a detailed process for prior-notice, providing reasons (while they have severe legal deficiencies) provide for a latter, more specific and detailed process of the same power under the grounds of, “national security” and, “public interest” thereby being a more developed regulatory mechanism.  Transparency is a threshold problem : For eg. Telegram The process of website blocking as noticed in this specific incident is a wider issue that has impacted popular internet based messaging application Telegram.\nWorking with Avinesh, one of IFF\u0026rsquo;s many community members who first filed the RTI to understand the reason why Telegram\u0026rsquo;s web domain was blocked in India, we had preseed for further transparency by filing a first appeal in March, 2019. Unfortunately the Department of Telecom is yet to respond to her.\n  Transparency is a real problem.\nIt undermines the public’s rights to receive information and even contest and approach court to seek restoration. We have also noticed a disturbing trend where that website blocks often emerge from Court Orders that may be premised in directions under Public Interest Litigations and overbroad intellectual property enforcement (top-level analysis of 4000 URLs blocked under court orders link). For instance, court based directions and vague directions by the Department of Telecom have led to the blocking of porn websites which are legal as a private exercise of consumption by Indians (analysis of blocking of porn websites link).\nSo what is IFF doing to address website blocking of WeTransfer? We are focussing on the problem of website blocking with a range of advocacy actions which increase chances of reform and success. In addition to creating public literacy materials like this update, and even a video explainer we are first addressing the immediate issue of the blocking of WeTransfer.\nTowards this we have sent a representation to the Department of Telecom (link) calling on it to undertake the following steps:\n Recall the Order: Specific to WeTransfer, we urge for the Order to be recalled and if grounds exist then a fresh process may be initiated under the Blocking Rules with proactive public disclosure and an opportunity for WeTransfer representatives to make thier case in defence. Such transparency will further confidence in the exercise of the regulatory power and further provide a right to members of the public to avail judicial remedies given the impact on the fundamental right to receive information. Restrict use of, “national security”: Grounds of, “national security” must not be utilised from overzealous Intellectual Property claims. There has been a tremendous growth of court orders that are often passed without adequate public disclosures when users attempt to access such services premised on allegations of infringement. Such claims cater to the private economic interests of large corporations. They are not within the traditional understanding of the security interests of the Government of India and undermine the intent of such power which are to be used solely in the defence of our national interest. Start a process for reform: As a solution, we urge for stepping towards institutional reforms, through an interdepartmental consultation that provides for public inputs on the issue of the reform of Website Blocking. This is especially important given such blocking regulations are antiquated, present a threat to not only the fundamental right to receive information (even Network Neutrality protections in the UA License given discretionary blocking by IPS’s), but also causes significant economic impacts for entrepreneurs and users (such as creative professionals who widely use WeTransfer for transferring large file sizes). Further regulatory confusion exists due to overlapping laws which occupy the same field and provide for divergent processes.  How can we address the wider problem of website blocking? As we have noticed, there is a threshold problem of a lack of transparency in Website Blocking in India.\n A public transparency capacity: Towards this later today, we will be opening up our growing capacity on transparency which is being implemented through RTIs and data side projects (on Section 66A cases and facial recognition deployment). At present this capacity is limited to one staffer and has been privately offered to digital rights researchers. We will outline principles that will help us to strategically offer this resource to maximise impact and supplement research and advocacy by the wider digital rights community in India. Strategic litigation: Before parting, we would also like to indicate that IFF through it\u0026rsquo;s team of lawyers and pro-bono counsels is presently conducting a strategic litigation on this very issue in the High Court of Delhi. This is the case of the website blocking of Dowry Calculator where we are representing it\u0026rsquo;s creator Tanul Thakur (link).  Finally, we do not see these actions as adversarial to the Government but with a view towards much needed regulatory reforms. Without prejudice to this litigation, we will continue good faith attempts to engage with all public bodies and government offices!\nHow can you help? #WeNeed50 We need your help.

We are particularly hopeful that this occurs after our request on May 8, 2020 to hold urgent hearings on Aarogya Setu. To keep the committee members up to date, and to serve as a briefing document, we yesterday sent across a range of materials which not only focus on Aarogya Setu but also the massive vulnerability reported on CSC Services that exposed millions of records including Aadhaar and caste records.\nUrgent hearings on data security and privacy The Parliamentary Standing Committee is a vital body to inform the law making process on issues of digital rights. While it has been actively meeting on a range of issues the present pandemic has impacted it\u0026rsquo;s work. The last meeting of the committee was on March 18, 2020 and, more disconcertingly the last time it had the occasion to discuss the issue of our data security and privacy was last year on December 13, 2019. Hence, it becomes incredibly important given the incredible pace of developments particularly the growth of government surveillance as well as increase in the collection sensitive personal data through applications such as Aarogya Setu a meeting is held soon.\nWe have highlighted this in our a letter we first wrote on June 10, 2020 making our case. This has been explained at length in this blogpost and also acknowledged by the Chairperson of the Committee, Dr. Shashi Tharoor.\n  \u0026ldquo;Link\u0026rdquo;\n  Subsequent to this, a notice was published a few days back announcing the Committee would indeed be meeting on June 10, 2020 and would be holding a hearing with officials from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The subject for this would be citizens data security and privacy. We believe this hearing can be conducted either in person or through remote conference keeping in mind the urgency of the issue as well as accounting for the safety and wellness of the members. Stopping the functioning of parliamentary committees would impact not only the quality of law making but severely undermine the functioning of our democracy.\nThis concern matches a global trend.

CP/XI(6)/144/(Prohibitory Order)/2020 under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The order prohibits the dissemination of certain information through social media platforms such as Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok etc. We have sent a representation to the Mumbai Police as well as the Maharashtra Home Department asking them to review and amend the order. We also recommended them to issue an advisory with a draft SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that draws from the “Joint Declaration on ‘Fake News’, Disinformation and Propaganda” issued by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression dated March 3, 2017 .\nWhat did the Mumbai Police do?\nThe Mumbai Police on May 23, 2020 issued an Order under Section 144, CrPC for regulation of social media use and to curb the spread of disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the order:\n Under paragraph 4 of the Order, prohibited information includes incorrect and distorted facts as well as derogatory and discriminatory remarks which cause panic and confusion among the general public and incite mistrust towards the government. Under paragraph 5, the Order also states that all persons designated as “admins” (administrators) on messaging and social media platforms will be held personally liable for the spread of any disinformation and derogatory and discriminatory remarks as stated above. Under paragraph 6 of the Order, the admins have the personal responsibility of reporting such dissemination to the police . The order states that any person contravening the order shall be punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which prescribes as punishment imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both. The order will remain in force until June 8, 2020.  This order has been challenged in the High Court of Bombay in a Writ Petition filed by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, who is a sitting MLA from Malabar Hill and the BJP Mumbai President. In the writ petition, the order has been challenged on the basis that the order is vague and places restrictions on the right to free speech which are not reasonable.\nThe order has been challenged on the basis that it fails the proportionality test as required under K. S. Puttuswamy v Union of India. The petition also states that the order can be used to target innocent people or people who are critical of the government response and thus be used to oppress dissent. Since criticism and dissent is essential in a democracy and also protected under the Constitution, the petition seeks to get the impugned order quashed.\nLegal Deficiencies with the Order\nA. Void for vagueness : The order restricts freedom of speech by failing to define the phrase “distorting facts”\nSince the order prohibits the dissemination of information that distorts facts, it is also incumbent upon the issuing authority to clearly define the ambit of what they consider to be distortion of facts. By failing to define the ambit clearly, the order suffers from the defect of being vague and providing a wide ambit to restrict the freedom of speech.\nB. Ultra vires : The order exceeds the ambit of Section 144 of CrPC\nThe impugned Order makes people who have been designated as “admins” on social media platforms personally responsible for dissemination of disinformation and also creates upon them a duty to report any person who is disseminating disinformation to the police. This exceeds the ambit of Section 144 of the CrPC under which the issuing authority can only pass a preventative order. The legal powers under it cannot be used to create a positive obligation upon a person to do a certain act.\nC. Lack of proportionality : Order under S.144 CrPC must be based on the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive measure.\nAny legitimate opinion or grievance, especially one which is critical of the government, could be qualified as one which is inciting mistrust towards the government under the order which is disproportionate as well as antithetical to the objective of the order itself. This would thus lead to the suppression of legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights which cannot be authorised under S.144.\nAdditionally, we already have legal provisions which relate to the mischief that this order aims to cure. These legal provisions are Section 153A, IPC, Section 295A, IPC and Section 505, IPC.Thus, the order is not the least intrusive measure as required under Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India __ which held that:\n“\u0026hellip;While exercising the power under Section 144, Cr.P.C. the Magistrate is duty bound to balance the rights and restrictions based on the principles of proportionality and thereafter apply the least intrusive measure. ”\nIFF’s recommendations\nDisinformation is a complex problem which must be addressed by a policy tool kit that promotes the values of free expression and also to exercise any censorship powers based on the legal standards that emerge that emerges from a human rights framework. Thus, IFF recommended that the Mumbai Police:\n Review paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the order and amend the parts which are incompatible with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India. Issue an advisory with a draft SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that draws from the “Joint Declaration on ‘Fake News’, Disinformation and Propaganda” by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression dated March 3, 2017.  Section 144, CrPC is being misused\nAs noted herein above the use of Section 144, CrPC must be based on the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive measure. However, misuse of Section 144, CrPC has become a troubling trend all over the country. It is a provision which provides almost unbridled power to the executive and has also received criticism for being used to suppress dissent. The Supreme Court recently held that the provision cannot be used as a tool to prevent legitimate expression of opinion, grievance or exercise of democratic rights. However, ultra vires orders still continue to be passed under the section.\nImportant Documents\n Representation to Mumbai Police \u0026amp; Maharashtra Home Department on Social Media Order dated June 03, 2020 (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/we-wrote-to-the-mumbai-police-asking-them-to-review-and-amend-their-social-media-order-issued-under-s-144-crpc/","summary":"On May 23, 2020 the Mumbai Police issued an Order under S.144, CrPC.

While this immediately met with blanket denials from Government officials, we are urging for recommendations that will help improve our digital public infrastructure by encouraging cyber security researchers in India.\nA massive security vulnerability impacting millions of India Two days back vpnMentor reported a massive cyber security vulnerability impacting sensitive financial and personal data impacting millions of Indians. Those impacted are from semi-urban and rural backgrounds leaving them particularly vulnerable and practically incapable to take effective steps to safeguard themselves.\nThe vulnerability impacted the website http://cscbhim.in/ which is operated by CSC e-Governance Services India Limited (CSC).

The principal role of CSC has been to promote and on-board millions of Indians particularly farmers and semi-urban and rural businesses (Village Level Entrepreneurs or VLEs) towards Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) to ostensibly promote financial inclusion through electronic payments.\nThe details of this vulnerability are truly shocking and reveal the following.\n Nature of the security lapse: The issue as explained is as follows, “In this case, the data was stored on an unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. S3 buckets are a popular form of cloud storage across the world but require developers to set up the security protocols on their accounts. The exposed S3 bucket was labeled “csc-bhim”, and our team was quickly able to identify the developers behind the website “www.cscbhim.in” as the owners of the data.” A further lapse indicated was, “The S3 bucket also contained an Android application package (APK), a file format used by Android’s operating system for the distribution and installation of apps. AWS Key pairs are the equivalent of admin user/password in Amazon’s infrastructure, potentially giving the holder of the key access to all data, the ability to start and stop servers, access the S3 bucket’s controls, and more.” Details of the personal data: The vulnerability impacted approximately 7.26 million records collected over the month of February 2019. Such records contained the details of scans of Aadhaar cards, scans of caste certificates, photos used as proof of residence, professional certificates and degrees, screenshots taken within financial and banking apps as proof of fund transfers along with Permanent Account Number (PAN) card details. To ensure authenticity, the researchers at vpnMentor have uploaded redacted screenshots of these records. Impact of the security lapse: Such a vulnerability would have impacted millions of ordinary Indians who were on boarded onto these services. In practical terms this has left them susceptible to identity theft, fraud and viral attacks. It may even lead to cases of extortion and phishing for sensitive information. Further levels of vulnerability would be high considering the target populations of CSC belong to semi-urban and rural backgrounds. Shockingly, as the researchers state, the exposed records included those of minors. These risks are escalated due to a lack of proper training, relative lack of user knowledge and further absence of meaningful consent during the onboarding process. As the researchers put it, “The exposure of BHIM user data is akin to a hacker gaining access to the entire data infrastructure of a bank, along with millions of its users’ account information.”  Can we go beyond bald denials and towards securing public, digital systems?\n  \u0026ldquo;Credit : Braided Times\u0026rdquo;\n  Some issues emerge from this cyber security incident on which we make specific recommendations:\n Admission and remedy by CSC: We were distressed by the official responses which rather than examining the nature of the claims in a meaningful manner, resorted to immediate denials. For instance as reported by MINT in it’s report dated June 1, 2020, Shri Dinesh Tyagi, CEO of CSC has stated that, “The claim is incorrect because we never captured Aadhaar data in the entire process,\u0026quot;. Further, the National Payment Corporation of India, stated by a “Media Statement” dated June 1, 2020 on its website that, “We would like to clarify that there has been no data compromise at BHIM App and request everyone to not fall prey to such speculations.” While we do acknowledge that the security vulnerability does not impact BHIM by itself, it is plainly evident that the vulnerability impacted documents gathered through a referral partner (i.e. CSC) containing sensitive personal information. At the very least this requires a departmental inquiry. Timelines and breach notification by CERT-In: As per the article CERT-In was first contacted on April 28, 2020 and date of action was May 22, 2020. This is almost a delay of close to two months in ensuring the proper configuration of a AWS S3 bucket of a seemingly standard configuration. We urge that the reason for it may be examined internally in order to hasten timelines for action and remedy as each moment of vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to the vulnerability of lakhs of ordinary Indians. Ideally, on the discovery and closure of the vulnerability a public statement should also follow by CERT-In in addition to a specific notification to each effected person on how it may impact them and what steps they should take to mitigate harm.  Promote, not only protect our security researchers! In this context, the directions by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its decision in Binoy Viswam v. Union of India [2017 SCC OnLine SC 647 at Para 126(iii)] serve as a reminder of the positive obligation to maintain data security when it stated that:\n “It is also necessary to highlight that a large section of citizens feel concerned about possible data leak….It is important that the aforesaid apprehensions are assuaged by taking proper measures so that confidence is instilled among the public at large that there is no chance of unauthorised leakage of data whether it is done by tightening the operations of the contractors who are given the job of enrollment, they being private persons or by prescribing severe penalties to those who are found guilty of leaking the details….”\n Our broader recommendation is for a comprehensive and focussed push towards improving cyber security by encouraging Indian security researchers. We have anecdotally found that India\u0026rsquo;s elite cybersecurity talent service foreign clients that conduct their work domestically, or towards improving digital, public systems.\nA large part of this has to also do with the absence of legal clarity and an absence of a centralised system for bug identification and bounties. Promoting such a system would create the right incentives for growing home-grown talent. Several granular recommendations by us on this subject are contained in our submissions on the Personal Data Protection Bill as well as the National Cyber Security Policy.\nImportant Links  Representation to the Minister for Electronics and IT dated 03.06.2020 (link) Security researchers need legislative protection for responsible disclosure (link) Educate and advocate for better privacy protection before the Data Protection JPC (link) Essential Features of a Rights Respecting Data Protection Law #SaveOurPrivacy (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/its-time-to-stop-data-breaches-and-security-vulnerabilities-we-write-to-the-it-ministry/","summary":"Till we fix the regulatory and cyber security plumbing of our digital, public infrastructure the data leaks and cyber security vulnerabilities will continue","title":"It's time to stop data breaches and security vulnerabilities.

Media reports suggest that RWAs are going well beyond the guidelines issued by the government and mandating use of Aarogya Setu by residents and visitors including domestic workers, drivers, delivery personnel and other service providers. Such measures may be well intentioned but they are illegal because the bottom line is that RWAs are private self-administration bodies which lack the power to issue rules restricting the freedom of movement and right to livelihood of individuals. In lights of this, we wrote to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the National Real Estate Development Council and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare seeking issuance of an advisory which clarifies that use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app cannot be made a precondition for entering residential colonies.\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it is RWAman!   \u0026ldquo;Credit: https://twitter.com/penpencildraw\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026quot;\n  Media reports indicate that Resident Welfare Associations (‘RWAs’) in several cities have made use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app a precondition for residents and visitors such as domestic workers, drivers, delivery persons, service providers etc. As you may know, Aarogya Setu is a COVID-19 surveillance app launched by the Indian government which has been heavily criticized for privacy, security and exclusion related concerns. IFF has opposed mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on the litigation, policy, RTI and public advocacy fronts. But before we delve into the legality of rules made by RWAs which mandate use of Aarogya Setu, let us first understand what is the legal status of RWAs themselves.\nA Resident Welfare Association is a voluntary body formed by the residents for the residents. It is a self-financed and self- managed association registered under the Society Registration Act, 1860 (subject to state-level amendments). The primary purpose of such an association is to represent the interests of residents of a specific locality/complex and perform the following illustrative functions:\n Represent the residents before the governmental authorities; Collect money for maintenance of common areas; Establish good public infrastructure for the residents; Organize workshops and cultural functions etc.  The government may also issue guidelines to RWAs as seen in the context of the Bhagidari Scheme in Delhi, which aims to promote broad-based civic participation in local governance. The formation of an RWA has also been made mandatory under Section 19(9) of the Real estate (Regulations \u0026amp; Development) Act, 2016.\nRWAs are governed by their Memorandum of Association (MoA)/ by laws which contain their objectives and functions. While the by-laws are binding amongst the residents, they lack statutory character and do not have the force of law as clarified by the Bombay High Court. For similar reasons, RWAs cannot issue directions prohibiting residents from keeping pet animals in violation of guidelines issued by the Animal Welfare Board of India under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.\nRWAs turn mini-sovereigns during COVID 19 The role of RWAs during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial to ensure that residents and visitors are adhering to government guidelines relating to wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in common areas. RWAs are also responsible for maintaining sanitation of common areas and facilitating supply of essential commodities in their locality. Recognizing the importance of RWAs as stakeholders, the National Centre for Disease Control has issued an advisory for RWAs to support and complement governmental efforts to contain spread of the virus.\nHowever, RWAs are slowly morphing from private self-administration bodies to mini-sovereigns in their own right. Several RWAs have taken it upon themselves to impose restrictions which as this news report notes, ‘‘make even the stringent terms of the lockdown pale in comparison.” For example, an RWA in Gurugram has asked its residents to have their domestic help tested for COVID-19 before they can be allowed into the premises. This is clearly inconsistent with testing guidelines framed by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) - the only competent authority for frame guidelines for COVID-19 testing. In another instance in Noida, permission to enter a housing complex will be granted only if the entrant has a ‘green’ status on the Aarogya Setu app.The most recent order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 30 May 2020 states that use of Aarogya Setu should be encouraged by employers on a “best efforts” basis and district authorities may “advise” individuals to install the app. The terminology used in these guidelines makes it abundantly clear that RWAs have not been authorized by the government to mandate use of Aarogya Setu among residents and visitors, and they do not have any authority to prohibit entry to residential colonies on this ground.As we have explained earlier, COVID-19 surveillance apps are susceptible to false positives and false negatives because of inherent limitations of bluetooth technology which is not a perfect proxy for virus exposure. If RWAs were allowed to force residents and visitors to download the Aarogya Setu app and allow entry based on the status displayed on the app, it could lead to wrongful confinement of certain residents and deprivation of livelihood of working class service providers. Residents who are shown by the app to be at risk of COVID-19 could be prohibited from leaving their house or accessing common areas. Further, domestic workers, drivers, delivery persons and other service providers could also be prohibited from entering the colony to do their jobs based on their status on the app.\nWhat can an ordinary resident do? If you find yourself in a situation with an overzealous RWA, first ask them for a copy of the by-laws and the rules and details of the procedure by which they were adopted. The RWA’s MoA and by-laws will contain the procedure for amending existing rules or adding new rules. Generally, new rules or amendments cannot be made without a General Body Meeting. If the rule making procedure has been flouted, the rules will be invalid.\nWe also encourage you to have a constructive dialogue with your RWA representatives highlighting concerns about accuracy and privacy of the Aarogya Setu app and explain that official MHA guidelines do not authorize RWAs to require mandatory use of Aarogya Setu. Any rules which are inconsistent with governmental guidelines may be an abuse of power by the RWA and can be challenged in court. Any resident who is aggrieved by arbitrary and unreasonable actions of an RWA can file a suit under Section 6 of the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The RWA can be sued in the local civil court in the name of the President or Secretary.\nRepresentation to Government We recognize that individual residents and working class service providers may not always have the bargaining power to negotiate with RWAs or approach courts. Therefore, we have written to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the National Real Estate Development Council and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare seeking issuance of an advisory which clarifies that use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app cannot be made a precondition for entering residential colonies.\nAs researchers at the Centre for Internet and Society note in their recent article on lateral surveillance, the COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed an increase in surveillance by private actors. Residential colonies cannot be controlled by RWAs as mini-sovereigns, and insofar as RWAs impose measures which are inconsistent with guidelines issued by the government, it amounts to vigilantism. During the COVID-19 crisis, the need of the hour is social solidarity and the government has a positive duty to prevent RWAs from engaging in intrusive and arbitrary practices which lack any basis in law and promote a culture of suspicion, stigma and exclusion.\n(This post has been authored by Sonalakshi Naidu, a legal intern at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer, Devdutta.)\nImportant Documents:  Representation regarding illegal imposition of Aarogya Setu by RWAs (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/aarogya-setu-rwas/","summary":"We wrote to the government seeking issuance of an advisory which clarifies that Resident Welfare Associations cannot make use of Aarogya Setu mandatory for entry into housing societies.","title":"RWA uncles, please calm down about Aarogya Setu #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  Tl;dr One day after the internet slowdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir was extended till 17 June 2020, Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) wrote to the Special Committee established by the Supreme Court to examine the issue of internet restrictions in the region. Despite being directed by the Supreme Court on 11 May 2020 to immediately determine the issue, the Special Committee has failed to take any action in almost three weeks. Therefore, on 28 May 2020, FMP wrote to members of the Special Committee seeking immediate review of internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir within 7 working days and urged the Committee to publish its recommendation rejecting/modifying/accepting the order issued by the government on 27 May 2020.\nBackground Tomorrow will mark the 300th day of restrictions on internet access in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir since they were intially imposed on 5 August 2019. What began as a total communication shutdown with even landlines being snapped has gradually changed to an internet slowdown in the region but in 2020, having an outdated 2G connection hardly constitutes meaningful internet access. The denial of 4G internet services has caused immense hardship to the people of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir especially during the COVID-19 crisis during which the internet has emerged as a lifeline. Without access to reliable and high speed mobile internet, the residents of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir are being deprived of telemedicine, online learning and the ability to work remotely.\nFailure to Comply with SC Directions Taking note of the difficulties caused by the internet slowdown, the Supreme Court had established a Special Committee consisting of MHA Secretary, DoT Secretary and Chief Secretary, J\u0026amp;K to \u0026ldquo;immediately determine\u0026rdquo; whether it was necessary to continue restrictions on internet access in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. These directions were issued by the Supreme Court in a petition filed by Foundation for Media Professionals, for which IFF retained counsels provided legal assistance. In its judgement, the Supreme Court also directed the Special Committee to examine the material produced by the petitioners and consider the availability of less restrictive alternatives such as narrowing down the scope of internet restrictions to specific districts for a limited period of time (Read more here).\nDespite the Supreme Court categorically directing the Special Committee to \u0026ldquo;immediately determine\u0026rdquo; the issue of restoration of 4G internet in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir, there has been no action by the Special Committee and nearly three weeks have passed since the Supreme Court delivered its judgement on 11 May 2020. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available information about whether the Special Committee has even had a meeting during this period.\nRenewal of Internet Restrictions On 27 May 2020, a new order was issued by the Govt of U.T. of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir directing internet service providers to continue slowing down mobile internet speed in all districts to 2G till 17 June 2020. The order claims that speed restrictions are necessary to prevent terrorism but there is no rational connection between internet access and rise in terrorism because as the order itself notes, there have been several encounters between army personnel and militants even during the past two weeks when severe internet restrictions were in place. Further, the order only references an incident in Srinagar and it fails to provide any material basis to demonstrate that there is a threat to public safety in all districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. Finally, despite there being ample evidence to the contrary, the order incorrectly claims that internet restrictions have not impeded COVID control measures and people can access mobile apps, online educational content and carry out business activities.\nDemand for Immediate Review and Restoration On 28 May 2020, the Foundation for Media Professionals wrote to members of the Special Committee seeking immediate review of internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir which have been renewed by the order issued on 27 May 2020. In its previous judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the Supreme Court had held that orders under the Telecom Suspension Rules must be periodically reviewed every seven working days. Relying on this, FMP has urged the Special Committee to undertake a review of the order issued on 27 May 2020 within 7 working days and publish its recommendation rejecting/modifying/accepting the order.\nIFF provided drafting assistance for this representation and we will keep pushing the Special Committee till it complies with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions in letter and spirit. We can only imagine what the people of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have endured during this prolonged period of internet disruptions and we will continue our advocacy within and outside courtrooms till 4G internet is restored in the region.\nImportant Documents  FMP\u0026rsquo;s Representation dated 28.05.2020 to Special Committee (link) FMP\u0026rsquo;s previous representation dated 16.05.2020 to Special Committee (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/fmp-demands-compliance-with-sc-judgement-by-special-committee-for-restoration-of-4g-in-j-k/","summary":"FMP wrote to the Special Committee established by the Supreme Court seeking immediate review of internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir within 7 working days and publication of the Committee\u0026rsquo;s recommendations.","title":"FMP demands compliance with SC directions by Special Committee for restoration of 4G in J\u0026K #KeepUsOnline #4GforAll"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Since its launch on April 2, 2020 the Aarogya Setu application has been embroiled in privacy and data protection related controversies. However, while these have been the primary concerns, much has also been written about the lack of transparency around the application. IFF has filed multiple Right to Information requests with various governmental authorities to extract all relevant information. In this post, we will highlight these requests, the substantial replies that we received as well as the non-answers which also tell us a lot.\nBackground On April 2, 2020 the Aarogya Setu application was launched by the Government of India. It claims to be COVID-19 tracking mobile application which has been developed in public-private partnership by the National Informatics Centre(NIC) that comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology(MeitY). It has been developed with the help of a group of unnamed volunteers and the NITI Aayog. Since it is collecting health data related to COVID-19, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is also a stakeholder.\nWhat did we ask? IFF has filed multiple RTI requests with NIC, NITI Aayog, MeitY and MOHFW to extract information about the Aarogya Setu application and the developments surrounding it.\nRTI requests filed on April 4, 2020\nIn our first round of RTI requests we asked the NIC and MOHFW about:\n The legislative framework, rules, guidelines or policies authorizing the use of the Aarogya Setu application. The kind of data collected by the app. The storage duration of the data collected from quarantined persons. Exhaustive list of government officials who will have access to this data. Persons/organizations with whom this data will be shared. The specific security safeguards which have been put in place to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable details of persons in quarantine and their data.  We also asked them about the government-appointed expert panel that has been formed to monitor the data being captured by the Aarogya Setu application.\nIn the reply that was sent by the MOHFW on April 21, 2020, they said that they did not hold any such information related to the Aarogya Setu application and transferred the request to NIC. It is inherently problematic that the MOHFW does not hold any information about the application which has been publicised to have been providing essential health services. (Read IFF’s initial tweet thread on the replies received here) They further transferred the request to MeitY who also claimed to not hold any information with regard to the application and transferred the request to NIC.\nWe received a reply from NIC on May 7, 2020 in which they also failed to adequately respond to our queries. (Read IFF’s initial tweet thread on the reply here)\n  In response to the question about the legislative framework which authorizes the use of the application, NIC transferred the specific request back to MeitY. Since MeitY has already stated in their own reply that they do not hold this information, this could mean either wilful flouting of transparency norms contained in the Right to Information Act or mismanagement due to lack of clarity on their part. Both these situations are less than ideal.\nIn response to the question about individuals and/or organizations who will have access to the health data collected, NIC replied that “The information from the Aarogya Setu App is used by the officials who are involved in COVID-19 related efforts.” This answer does not satisfy the query we raised in which we asked for an exhaustive list of such officials. Such vague answers are also not ideal since they leave the ambit too wide and essentially do not answer the question asked. It is also pertinent to note here that in the since published Protocol which provides legal basis to the application, it was stated that access will also be provided to third party researchers.\nSubsequent RTI requests In subsequent RTI requests we asked NIC, NITI Aayog, MeitY and MOHFW to disclose the names of the group of volunteers who developed the Aarogya Setu application filed on April 29, 2020. We also asked them to reveal the source code of the application in a bid to increase the transparency around it in RTI requests filed on May 7, 2020 . It is pertinent to note here that all these requests are being transferred from the authorities we filed them with to the NIC.\nAdditionally, an IFF community member filed a RTI request dated May 6, 2020 in which they asked for the source code of the Aarogya Setu application. In NIC’s reply dated May 13, 2020, they refused to reveal the source code citing S.8(1)(d) of the Right to Information Act which states that:\nNotwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.\nThis could mean that the application may be exploited in the future for some commercial use. It also means that certain commercial/proprietary rights may be vested with the third parties themselves. Since we do not know the names of all the volunteers who were involved in the development of the application, this brings into question their motivation for volunteering to build the application. However, in a clear departure from its previous stance, yesterday MeitY issued a public statement in which they said that the application will be made open source. The source code of the application was made available on Github by the Government at 12 AM on May 27, 2020.\nRTI Requests on the Protocol On May 11, 2020 the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 (“The Protocol”). This Protocol has been introduced to provide legal basis to the application and depositions have been made by the Government in the Kerala HC pursuant to this. (Read our analysis of the protocol here) On May 13, 2020 we filed an RTI request pertaining to the Protocol. In it we enquired about the composition and the members of the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management who were involved in drafting the protocol. We also asked if any legal opinion was sought to draft the protocol. We also filed a RTI request with IIT Madras asking about their involvement with the application since it was indicated in official documents that they have access to the data collected through the application.\nThe Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy has been involved in drafting the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 which provides a legal basis to the application. They have also published an explainer on the Protocol. Subsequently, there was talk among the community that they have also shared a legal opinion with the Government.\nOn May 25, 2020 we filed a RTI request on the basis of this tweet by Vidhi’s Research Director asking for a copy of the legal opinion provided by him or other employees of the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. We also asked for a copy of all the subsequent correspondence that took place between the government and Mr. Lalitesh Katragadda and Mr.Rahul Matthan, who have been identified by Mr. Sengupta in a previous tweet as having been involved.\nWe will be following up on all these subsequent RTI requests according to the mandated timelines and will be doing a follow-up blogpost on the topic.\nWhy is transparency important with regard to the Aarogya Setu Application? Right to Information requests help in facilitating government transparency which then helps individuals in asking for accountability. The Aarogya Setu application which is collecting the health data of millions of Indians needs to be accountable to these individuals. However, the Government of India and the various governmental authorities who have been involved in the development and deployment of this application have failed to disclose relevant information about the application. In failing to do so, the government opens up the application to questions regarding its legitimacy.\nSince there was no public debate which was held before the deployment of the application, it becomes even more imperative to ensure that accountability is demanded from the government by mobilizing mechanisms such as the Right to Information Act. The Government has a legal responsibility to provide satisfactory responses on queries raised under this Act failing which further action may be initiated by concerned individuals and organizations.\nUpdate: On 12.06.2020, we received an RTI response from Air India which stated that use of Aarogya Setu was mandatory for air travel. In another RTI response, the Cabinet Secretariat invoked the cabinet papers exemption under S.8(1)(i) of the RTI Act and declined to provide any information about the Committee constituted by it for developing and implementing a Citizen App technology platform for combating COVID 19.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s working paper on COVID-surveillance \u0026ldquo;Privacy prescriptions for technology interventions around Covid-19 in India\u0026rdquo; dated April 13, 2020******(**Google Docs version **/** PDF Version**)****** “We Studied the Protocol: And No This Doesn’t Sufficiently Protect Your Privacy” IFF Blogpost dated May 13, 2020******(**link**)******  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/aarogya-setu-through-the-right-to-information-lens/","summary":"IFF has filed multiple Right to Information requests with various governmental authorities on the Aarogya Setu application.

The controversy surrounding the contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc. is being addressed by the Kerala High Court in the ongoing matter of Balu Gopalakrishnan and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Ors. The main questions raised pertaining to there being no safeguards against the commercial and unauthorized use of the health data of the citizens of Kerala by Sprinklr Inc. While an interim order dated April 24, 2020 provides some relief, it fails to address certain key issues. IFF has shared a representation with the Government of Kerala and an Expert Committee formed on the issue. In it, we have pointed out the lacunae in the order and have made specific suggestions on how best to resolve them. Our main recommendation is, in keeping with the ideal of competitive federalism, the Government of Kerala should develop a state level framework to regulate the collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.\nWhat was the issue with Sprinklr Inc.?\nThe Government of Kerala’s contract with Sprinklr Inc., a US based company, aims to create an online digital software/platform to process and analyse data of patients and those vulnerable/susceptible to COVID-19 in the State of Kerala. The arrangement aims to set up a Data Analytics Platform which integrates data from repositories across the Government, agencies and from the field so as to meet the exigency of a massive influx of data due to the pandemic.\nThe controversy arose when allegations were made that the government did not follow due procedures in appointing Sprinklr and thereby risked the transfer of crucial health data of thousands of people to pharmaceutical companies. While this is a valid concern, it also highlights the lack of governance discourse related to fundamental risks to people’s privacy which should have been a principal consideration while determining contours of the arrangement. The Contract between the two parties fails to address these risks.\nMore specifically, the accompanying Non-Disclosure Agreement between the parties, states that the purpose of the contract is that, “the parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and benefit”. This demonstrates a desire to keep available an opportunity to commercially exploit people’s sensitive personal information like their health data. Any such commercial use however can only be done after a system of legislative and independent institutional oversight is put in place. Such institutional oversight is lacking currently.\nWhat did the Kerala High Court do?\nThe Kerala High Court to its credit did highlight that maintaining data confidentiality is key when processing the health data of citizens of the State. The Court has issued an interim order dated providing some intervening relief to citizens even as it deliberates on the issue. These are:\n It mandated that a process of anonymisation be followed before sharing this data with Sprinklr Inc. The Order directed that such data be shared with Sprinklr Inc. only after informing every citizen from whom the data is collected and obtaining specific consent from them. The Order injuncted Sprinklr Inc. from breaching the data confidentiality of the data obtained from the citizens of Kerala and ordered them to not disclose the data to any third party. The Order instructed Sprinklr Inc. to transfer back the data once the term of their contract with the Government of Kerala is completed. The Court injuncted Sprinklr from advertising or representing or holding over to any third party/person/entity – of whatever nature or composition – that they are in possession or have access to any data regarding COVID-19 patients or persons vulnerable/susceptible to it.  However, there were some issues that the High Court failed to address, the most important of which is the auditability of their Order. In our representation, we have highlighted the lacunae in the HC order and in the Contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc.\nThe Situation in the United Kingdom is similar and we can look to how Civil Society Organisations have addressed this there to create a solution\nOn May 18, 2020 civil society organisations, privacy advocates and academic researchers including Article 19, Liberty, openDemocracy and Privacy International wrote a joint letter to the UK Health Secretary’s office. In particular the letter addressed a March 2020 announcement by the UK’s National Health Service to grant private-sector tech firms access to the aggregated health data of millions of UK citizens towards building a datastore collected to specifically respond to the coronavirus.\nIn it these disparate stakeholders urged the NHS to suitably clarify to the public, the following aspects, before commencing the development of the datastore:\n What is the need for such a solution? What problems does such an arrangement aim to solve by building the datastore? What alternatives have been explored? How is the datastore financed? Has the NHS considered the trade-offs? What do these considerations look like? How does this proposal shift the balance of power from the public to the private sector? Who has control over the data in these public private partnerships ? Who is most at risk and how are they protected? What is the exit strategy? For what duration is the data collected and what happens when that period ends? If the exit strategy depends on the pandemic ending, then what criteria are used to determine when the pandemic is indeed over? (i.e. when is the promised destruction of the datastore triggered?) What public facing documentation do you intend to provide describing this datastore and the various data sources? Will further use of the datastore by the Department of Health Care Services, or its partners, outside the scope as currently defined, be communicated with the public? What party do you intend to use for privacy compliance and security auditing of the system  The situation in the UK is similar to the current situation in Kerala where Sprinklr Inc. has been entrusted with the health data of the citizens of Kerala. In particular, in the current instance data has been shared with a private party, not even located within Kerala, towards building an unknown software/analytics platform, which may even be leveraged for commercial use.\nConstitutional Federalism is the need of the hour\nIn an op-ed, Mr.Raman Jit Singh Chima, who is also the Chair of the IFF Board of Trustees, has pointed out that the ideal of federalism which is enshrined in the Constitution of India is being undermined by Disaster Management Act, 2005 notifications being issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. “Much of what the Ministry of Home Affairs is issuing in its orders under the Disaster Management Act impacts the powers of states and local bodies, as well as the fundamental rights of citizens.”\n“Among the exclusively delineated areas of legislative and executive competence of States is the power and responsibility of public order and police.” Additionally the competence to legislate on matters relating to public health including collection and processing of health data is contained in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Keeping these factors in mind, we believe that the Government of Kerala should create a state level framework to regulate their collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations passed through Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This may be done by issuing regulations on the same under the state government’s powers under the same act.\nWe believe this presents the Government of Kerala with an opportunity to pass a framework which can allow for the responsible use of health data through ICT systems during epidemics/health crises. The framework may be applicable to both government actors and private parties as well. It would allow for adequate legal and institutional safeguards which suitably protect people’s privacy, whilst creating a legal pathway for data-side and tech based interventions as well.\nFinal recommendations by IFF\nFinally, aside from the urgent need for a regulatory framework as indicated above, we urged the Government of Kerala to suitably address our various concerns with its arrangement with Sprinklr Inc. as detailed throughout the representation. In particular we urge them to:\n Application of the Kerala HC order should be verified by creating transparent systems of audit. The Kerala Government should prescribe a clear date of termination of the Contract with Sprinklr. They should also prescribe clear guidelines which can act as Standard Operating Procedure upon termination of Contract for complete extraction of data from Sprinklr. Adherence to best practices principles for collection and processing of health data which include currently existing frameworks such as the GDPR and the Supreme Court’s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India. Finally, the Government of Kerala should use the questions asked in the open letter shared with the UK’s NHS vis-a-vis its datastore, as a template to deepen public engagement, understanding and dialogue on the project. Such engagement will help reduce privacy and security concerns and would also help people to share insights and suggest measures which may be taken for course correction on an immediate basis.

Therefore, blanket orders cannot be issued which indiscriminately slow down internet services in all districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir without providing specific reasons for each district. In addition to this, the representation reiterated FMP\u0026rsquo;s submissions made before the Supreme Court about unsuitability of internet restrictions as a tool to address terrorism and suggested that there were several less restrictive alternatives available to the government such as blocking specific websites or restricting internet access for a limited period in a limited area to tackle the threat of terrorism.\nTimeline of Events Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 31.03.2020. The petition highlighted how slowdown of internet services in the region had deprived the people of their right to access healthcare, education, livelihood, justice and information during the COVID-19 pandemic (Read more about the petition here).\nTo concretely demonstrate the impact of the restrictions, the Director of FMP- Ms. Revati Laul collected personal testimonies of doctors, students, teachers, businesspersons, lawyers and journalists in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir about the hardships being faced by them due to lack of effective internet. The petitioners also filed an affidavit authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre which provided a technical analysis of web performance at 2G v. 4G speed and revealed that video facilities and important resources like WHO\u0026rsquo;s Situation Tracker did not function at 2G speed. (Read more about these affidavits here).\nThe matter was substantively heard by the Supreme Court on 04.05.2020 and the Court reserved its order in the matter on the same day. During the oral hearing and in its counter-affidavit, the government repeatedly cited the threat of terrorists using the internet to conduct their operations, recruit new members and spread propaganda as a justification for the restrictions on internet speed. However, the petitioners challenged this narrative through empirical studies and the government\u0026rsquo;s own data which showed there was no rational connection between internet access and rise in terrorism (Read more about the court hearing here).\nOn 11.05.2020, the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict in the matter and it constituted a Special Committee consisting of (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, (ii) Secretary, Department of Telelcom and (iii) Chief Secretary, U.T. of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to decide whether the internet slowdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir was necessary and proportionate after balancing competing concerns of terrorism and human rights. The Committee was also required to consider alternatives suggested by the petitioners including restoration of high speed internet in some districts on a trial basis (Read more about the judgement here).\nSpecial Committee must restore 4G On 16.05.2020, FMP wrote to all members of the Special Committee seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. In its representation, FMP laid emphasis on the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s observation that previous orders issued by the government under the Telecom Suspension Rules had imposed restrictions across all districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir without providing any specific reasons for each district. The representation also highlighted the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s holding that internet restrictions are proportionate only if they are geographically and temporally limited. Therefore, blanket orders cannot be issued which indiscriminately slow down internet services in all districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir without providing district specific reasons.\nIn addition to this, the recent representation reiterated FMP\u0026rsquo;s submissions made before the Supreme Court about unsuitability of internet restrictions as a tool to address terrorism and pointed out that terrorist activities had increased in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the two weeks preceeding the most recent order dated 11.05.2020 despite severe internet restrictions being in place. Finally, the representation suggested that there were several less restrictive alternatives available to the government such as blocking specific websites or restricting internet access for a limited period in a limited area to tackle the threat of terrorism.\nIFF provided drafting assistance for this representation to the Special Committee. IFF retained counsels have also provided legal representation to FMP in the recent petition regarding internet slowdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic and the previous challenge against the communication shutdown imposed in the region after abrogation of Article 370. Along with FMP, we remain fully committed to restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and this representation is another incremental step towards achieving this goal which will require public advocacy, legislative reform and follow up litigation in the long term.\nImportant Documents  Representation from FMP to Special Committee (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/fmp-approaches-special-committee-established-by-sc-for-restoration-of-4g-internet-in-j-k/","summary":"Foundation for Media Professionals wrote to the Special Committee emphasising that blanket orders cannot be issued to indiscriminately slow down internet services in all districts of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir especially since there are less restrictive alternatives available.","title":"FMP approaches Special Committee established by SC for restoration of 4G internet in J\u0026K #KeepUsOnline #4GforAll"},{"content":"  Tl;dr\nSection 66A of the Information Technology Act (“IT Act”), 2000, was enacted into the statute through an amendment in 2008. The section penalised sending \u0026ldquo;offensive messages\u0026rdquo; via online communication. Owing to excessive vagueness in the laws, the provision was often abused by enforcement authorities and ran the risk of a chilling effect on speech over the internet. In 2015, the section was deemed unconstitutional by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Shreya Singhal v Union of India. However, despite repeated directions by the Supreme Court, the most recent in 2019, the provision continues to be invoked across the country. In an earlier article we highlighted continued prosecutions under Section 66A, as recently as March 2020. In this post we trace the journey of Section 66A of the IT Act from 2008 to 2020.\n  The Genesis\nThe Information Technology Act, 2000 (‘IT Act’) was enacted to provide a legal framework for the promotion of e-commerce and e-transactions in the country. In 2005, an expert committee was set up to review the IT Act to address the need for regulating cyber forensics and cyber crime, facilitating and promoting the growth of electronic governance and commerce, and complying with international security practices and procedures. The committee submitted its report with recommendations on a range of issues including computer related crime and electronic evidence.\nOn December 15, 2006, The Information Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2006 was introduced in the Lok Sabha. It proposed introducing new provisions to deal with new forms of crimes like, sending offensive emails and multimedia messages, child pornography, cyber terrorism, publishing sexually explicit materials in electronic form, video voyeurism, e-commerce frauds like cheating by personation (phishing), identity theft, etc.\nIt was through this process that Section 66A was integrated into the IT Act. The provision was aimed to deal with cyber crimes against women, especially to punish those sending ‘vulgar mobile phone SMSes to women’. The Bill was then referred to the Standing Committee On Information Technology, which was headed by Shri Nikhil Kumar on 19th December 2006. In a unanimous report on the proposed amendments, the standing committee, while suggesting many changes to the proposed bill, did not express any concern over the possible misuse of S. 66A.\nOn December 22, 2008, the Lok Sabha passed eight bills, sans debate. One of those was the 2006 Amendment Bill passed as the IT Amendment Act, 2008 (‘Amendment Act’) which amended the IT Act, formally introducing Section 66A which penalised sending \u0026ldquo;offensive messages\u0026rdquo; . The Amendment Act was passed in the Rajya Sabha on the next day.\nIn the session that began immediately after the Mumbai attacks on November 26, 2008, the Parliament prioritised legislations which were linked by an apparent aim to investigate and prosecute offences affecting the security of India. These were the National Investigation Agency Act, Unlawful Activities Prevention (Amendement) Act and the Information Technology (Amendment) Act. The Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 when passed was primarily projected as an anti-terrorism amendment to thwart future terrorist attacks such as the November 26, 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai. The Amendment Act was passed, with an emphasis on terrorism and cyber crime, to allow authorities to intercept messages from mobile phones, computers and other communication devices, and block websites in the interest of national security.\nFurther, on both days, the functioning of the two houses was severely disrupted by Opposition members raising a ruckus over comments made by the then minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay questioning the circumstances of the death of a police officer in the 2008 Mumbai Terror attacks. In consequence, the Amendment Act was discussed for only 21 minutes in the Lok Sabha and passed without debate in the Rajya Sabha.\nThe Amendment Act came into force with effect from October 27, 2009.\nThe life of S.66A\nThe said amendment was criticised severely on grounds of :\n being violative of people’s fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression; and subjective terminology which permits law enforcement agencies to mold its definition at their desire and willingness to interpret it.  Since the insertion of Section 66A, wide powers of the section were frequently used to stifle political dissent. One, particularly infamous, incident was the arrest of two girls in Mumbai over a Facebook post criticising the bandh in Maharashtra on the death of the Shiv Sena Chief, Bal Thackerey, in November 2012. One of them had posted the allegedly illegal content, while another simply ‘liked’ it. Within hours of the post and subsequent ‘like’, the two were arrested and charged under S.295A of the Indian Penal Code and S. 66A of the IT Act. Although the girls were released later and the criminal charges against them were dropped, it evoked severe criticism all over the country. The general sentiment was that the police had misused its power by invoking S. 66A as a weapon to stifle political dissent, as opposed to regulating harmful content.\nShocked by the blatant misuse of the law, a Public Interest Litigation (‘PIL’) petition was filed, in November 2012, seeking to declare S. 66A of the IT Act, 2000 as unconstitutional. This commenced the process of one of India’s and even the world’s most significant internet law judgements in modern history.\nDuring the pendency of the case, a question was posed in July 2014, before the Rajya Sabha inquiring if the Government considered amending Section 66A due to concerns of misuse . The Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, answered that the provisions were considered to be in line with the fundamental constitutional provisions. He stated that detailed discussions were held by Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee (‘CRAC’) with stakeholders including industry associations, intermediaries, civil society actors and users on the effect of Section 66A. These discussions purportedly found that the law itself was appropriate, but steps were needed to minimise the likelihood of abuse or misuse.\nAccordingly, the Central Government issued an Advisory dated 9th January 2013 prohibiting any arrest pursuant to Section 66A unless such arrest was approved by senior police officers. The Supreme Court , in the PIL challenging the validity of S.66A, directed all the States / Union Territories to ensure compliance to the Advisory before effecting arrest under S. 66A of IT Act.\nOn March 24, 2015 the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India passed a landmark judgement in the matter of Shreya Singhal v Union of India. The Hon’ble Supreme Court relied on international human rights and Indian constitutional benchmarks to hold that Section 66A of the IT Act arbitrarily and disproportionately affected the right to free speech.\nThe Court agreed with the the petitioner’s contention that S. 66A is capable of limiting all forms of internet communications as it makes no distinction “between mere discussion or advocacy of a particular point of view, which may be annoying or inconvenient or grossly offensive to some and incitement by which such words lead to an imminent causal connection with public disorder, security of State etc.” [para. 20] The Court found that S.66A was vague and could be arbitrarily interpreted to penalise even innocent speech. The effect of this decision would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A.\nThe 66A Zombies rise\nIn light of the provision being declared unconstitutional, the story should have had a neat conclusion wherein people are no longer prosecuted or punished under an unconstitutional law. However, a 2018 study by Gupta and Sekhri highlighted the continued use of Section 66A, including fresh cases registered in police stations, investigated and, considered by lower Courts, even after the Shreya Singhal decision. The authors described the continued use of the provision as a “Legal Zombie”. They acknowledged that the study was based on limited data. The study postulates that\n that there has been no change in the text of the statute book, through an amendment. Commercial publishers attempted to remedy this to a certain extent by including a footnote indicating that the provision was struck down; the continued use of the invalid provision reflects a ‘signal failure’, that is, the failure of the executive, legislature and judiciary to respond to judicial development; there was insufficient dissemination of the judgment through official channels by the executive; and the supervisory role of the High Courts in ensuring awareness by lower Courts was ineffective in that it also failed to provide specific directions for the dissemination of the judgment.  For example, as noted by Gupta and Sekhri, the High Court Rules published by the High Court of Delhi failed to incorporate any provision for communicating decisions from the Supreme Court to the lower courts.\nUnder Articles 227 and 235 of the Constitution of India, High Courts are granted supervisory jurisdiction and administrative powers to maintain the efficient, smooth and orderly functioning of District Court and Tribunals, within its jurisdiction. These powers include\n making and issuing general rules for regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts; and monitoring the day to day functioning of these courts.  These powers granted by Articles 227 and 235, entrust the High Courts with the duty to ensure effective communication of Supreme Court decisions to the subordinate courts within its jurisdiction, and also ensure compliance with such orders.\nThe battle against the 66A Zombies begins\nIn January, 2019, People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties (‘PUCL’), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal Case, approached the Supreme Court highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court\u0026rsquo;s original decision.\nIn a counter-affidavit, the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on Section 66A. This included a letter the Government wrote on 11th January, 2019 and then a reminder on 14th January, 2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on Section 66A cases and also asking them to close them. Some states responded.\nFor instance, Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after S. 66A was held to be unconstitutional and they would be closing all of them. The Court by judgement dated February 15, 2019, not only directed that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed but also that no fresh charges may be registered. The SC further directed that the Shreya Singhal judgement be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.\nThe battle against the 66A Zombies continues\nDespite this, fresh complaints continue to be filed, as recently as April 2020. In January 2020, the Karnataka High Court imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 each on two police officers for registering an FIR under Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act. In February 2020, a guest lecturer at a college in Assam, was charged, arrested and later sent to judicial custody for posting derogatory remarks against the BJP, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ‘Sanatan dharma’.\nIn March 2020, the Patna High Court granted bail to two petitioners who had been in custody for 6 months. These instances highlight the continued invocation of S. 66A, 5 years after it was declared unconstitutional, despite further directions by the Supreme Court in 2019. This points to a systematic failure by the judiciary and law enforcement system.\nWe are committed to erasing S. 66A from every FIR and criminal case all across India, irrespective of the person who is being prosecuted. This blogpost on the journey of S. 66A highlights the importance and challenges of monitoring and ensuring compliance with the final decisions of the Supreme Court.\nTo meet this challenge we, in collaboration with CivicDataLab (‘CDL’) with the support of Tech4Dev, have come up with a tool to track cases under S.66A through strong data collection, analysis, and visualization tools. We will be working in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system.\nHelp us in our mission to track and hunt these legal zombies , donate and become a member today!\nThis post has been authored by Sonalakshi Naidu, a legal intern at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer, Anushka Jain)\nImportant Documents\n Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta (link) Section 66A bites ‘zombie’ dust.

Endorsement and advocacy efforts by diverse organisations from trade unions to gender justice collectives signed on to this joint letter.

Aarogya Setu changes from mandatory to, “best efforts”."},{"content":"  Tl;dr\nOn May 11, 2020 the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 (“The Protocol”). It revealed the Government of India’s National Executive Committee (“NEC”) has constituted an Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management, which is looking at among other things the development and implementation of the Aarogya Setu. The Protocol is meant to allay concerns of informational privacy and mass surveillance which are attached with the Aarogya Setu programme. However, according to our clause by clause analysis it falls considerably short of principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.\nWe would like to thank IFF’s off-counsel Vrinda Bhandari; and lawyers Abhinav Sekhri and Gautam Bhatia in helping us unpack the Protocol.\nBackground\nMultiple petitions have been filed before the Kerala High Court against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu. These petitions include one which is filed by Jackson Mathew, in which IFF is offering legal support. A day before hearings on May 11, 2020 the MeitY released the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 (“The Protocol”). As highlighted in our update yesterday, about the hearings at the Kerala High Court, highlighted that the Counsel from MeitY insisted that Aarogya Setu was the best app in the world and emphasized that a protocol had also been issued to address privacy concerns. This argument was meant to suggest that the Protocol ring fences the Aarogya Setu app sufficient legal backing and also offers enough safeguards to people’s privacy.\nOur analysis also comes in the wake of the Aarogya Setu app being made mandatory to access many essential services and facilities. For instance, in a late night tweet, the Ministry of Railways announced that as passenger trains restart, it will be mandatory for passengers to download the app. Similarly, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has proposed a standard operating procedure (SOP) to restart commercial travel. The proposed SOP reportedly will require all flight passengers to have a “Green Status” on the Aarogya Setu app.\n  However, as our analysis states (a PDF of which is provided at the end of this document) very clearly states that the Protocol fails to satisfy the legality threshold.\nCompatibility with Legality\nThe Protocol is not a statute, and nor does it offer any legislative foundation for the Aarogya Setu Mobile Application. Therefore, the primary issue of Aarogya Setu lacking legal basis is still alive and unaddressed. For clarity fundamental rights under the Constitution cannot be restricted by the Government even for legitimate purposes without express legislative authorisation. The Protocol is not - and does not purport to provide - any such authorisation. A troubling aspect in this regard, is that Government authorities have said that there are no plans to create an underlying legislation to hold the usage of the app accountable, since the “priority at present is to deal with the epidemic itself.”\nUnderlying Basis and Rationale of the Order is Questionable\nKeeping this questionable legality in mind, we notice that the Government has constituted 11 Empowered Groups. Empowered Group 9 is specifically tasked with Technology and Data Management. It is important to note that to the best of our knowledge there is no mention in a press bulletin, Government notification, the Aarogya Setu app’s Terms of Service, Privacy Policy or FAQs, that Empowered Group 9 has been solely responsible for the creation and execution of the Aarogya Setu app.\nThere is also no reference in this Order or any other government notification about the actual membership composition of Empowered Group 9 on Technology and Data Management. In addition, there is no reference in the Protocol or any other government notification about the means through which Empowered Group 9 has sought external inputs on the drafting of the Protocol.\nThe Protocol is drafted in a manner, which justifies the centralised collection of data through the new Aarogya Setu platform. It does this without any discussion about the choice of design, and why existing alternatives which exist through avenues like telecom operators, or for that matter anonymised mobility reports reports developed in an open source format by researchers and organisations like Facebook/Google, are not enough. There is no discussion on why existing data at the Government’s disposal collected through hospitals, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, on ground surveillance teams, etc. does not suffice in fulfilling the objective referenced by the Protocol.\nThe Protocol also fails to acknowledge the fact that when data is collected in a primary fashion from individual users, it is of course a more intrusive collection process. Therefore it comes with inherent risks to informational privacy. Instead the Protocol stresses on the need for efficient data collection and sharing. Unfortunately, there is little to no discussion on ensuring that the most privacy-respecting practices are adopted, which are least intrusive in nature.\nIn addition the Protocol arbitrarily states that there is an urgent need for data pertaining to individuals “to formulate appropriate health responses for addressing the Covid-19 pandemic”. What is convenient for authorities is that “Appropriate health responses” is expansively defined. In fact such an expansive definition is curious since a think tank which supported the Government of India in drafting the Protocol has stated in an explainer blog post that the purpose of the Protocol is “exposure notification and contact tracing”. If that were indeed the case, then such a broad definition for Appropriate health responses is incompatible with the principle of proportionality.\nIn contrast, all other apps across the world’s democracies (across the economic and geographical spectrum) are only deploying apps to support/expedite their country’s on-ground contact tracing efforts. In India the app’s expansiveness is being positioned as it speaks to India’s innovation. This would be a disingenuous characterisation. Most other countries are taking their time to ensure that the application of such technologies when ultimately scaled are in fact consistent with their civil liberties obligations.\nTherefore, the Protocol is not engaging in data collection through the prism of deploying the least restrictive measure that is hemmed in by clear purpose-based requirements, and is, therefore, falling foul of the proportionality principle.\nConcerns About Implementation and Possible Mission Creep\nThe Protocol fails to specify how it will interact with the Aarogya Setu app’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that were already in place. For instance, the Privacy Policy already contains a set of practices governing data collection and storage. Many of those provisions are now in conflict with the Protocol. However, the Protocol fails to outline the effect of these conflicts and how they will be rationalised. This creates confusion, uncertainty, and risks of greater flexibility for retention and sharing of people’s personal and sensitive personal information.\nWe also believe that the chain of command evokes concerns of possible mission creep. What is especially concerning is that India’s public health institutions have minimal leadership even as these technologies are being built to respond to a public health crisis.\nDon’t Just Use Buzzwords Like “Necessary and Proportionate”. Meaningfully Incorporate Them\nThe use of such phraseology is meant to demonstrate that the Protocol incorporates purpose and use limitations on data collected by the App. However, they are far from restrictive. For example, “Appropriate health responses” is a broad term that covers a wide gamut of government operations. In other words, “purpose limitation” and the principles of necessity and proportionality with respect to data collection acts as a meaningful constraint only if the purpose is spelt out with clarity and specificity to start with. If the purpose itself is excessively broad, vague, and evolving, then “necessity” and “proportionality” have no meaning at all, since data collection needs to be necessary and proportionate with regard to the purpose for which it is being collected. The Protocol, therefore, attempts to do an end run around core data principles by leaving the purpose so vague and ill-defined, that excessive data collection can potentially always be justified as necessary and proportionate.\nFurther, the Protocol’s reference to the principle for processing data in a “fair, transparent and non-discriminatory manner” rings hollow. Specifically, it does not require the NIC to publicly share its data processing practises. In fact, one way for processing to be transparent is by publishing the app’s underlying source code. Instead, India has not published the Aarogya Setu app’s source code and even now, a recent statement of the Secretary, MeitY indicates a reticence to publish the source code before the public.\nExcessive Collection, Processing and Storage of Personal Data\nAccording to the Protocol, the default setting is that contact and location data remain on the device and not uploaded on to the server. This default setting is, however, immediately overridden by the next sentence which states that such data may be uploaded to the server to formulate / implement appropriate health responses. Given the breadth of this purpose, there is, in effect, no clarity or certainty on when contact and location data may be uploaded on the server. Moreover, the breadth of this exemption allows for the seamless creation of a centralised system.\nIn general the storage policies are high deficient and cannot be aligned with people’s right to privacy, or the proportionality principle:\n Data retention for six months, without any process of review while allowing for potential extension of this time-limit, is not the least intrusive measure that could be adopted. This is because it allows for retaining of people’s personal data for durations beyond the duration of the Protocol itself. Consider the following example. Imagine someone’s contact/location/self assessment data is exported on daya 45. Then that data could be retained for a period of 45 days beyond the purported last date of the Protocol which is fixed at 6 months where this data retention takes place in a legal vacuum. The Protocol also fails to clarify what are the extraordinary circumstances in which the Government may unilaterally retain contact, location and self assessment data for a period longer than 180 days. There is no policy for destroying contact, location and self assessment data based on a user request, contrary to the Protocol for demographic data. The total failure to consider user-request based destruction of such data amounts to retaining personal data without consent and is a clear breach of the right to privacy. Para 5(e) also fails to clarify whether this provision applies to anonymised data or not. This is important to highlight because the current Privacy Policy of the Aarogya Setu App specifies that the data retention clause is not applicable to anonymised data. Such exemptions, if they still subsist, retain concerns of permanent systems of data analysis/surveillance.  Researchers Can Get Access to Our Data. Wait? What?\nThe Protocol allows for sharing response data for research purposes with certain specified institutions / entities registered in India where the data has undergone “Hard Anonymisation”. This demonstrates the incentives for why the Government of India has taken a centralised approach. It is less about taking the least intrusive measure towards responding to the public health crisis, but more towards maximising the utility of data. In some ways it also shows an appetite on the Government of India to commercialise or discover commercial applications the Aarogya Setu app, rather than go the path of other democratic societies which are more focused on decentralised models which may effectively alert people to get tested and treated for the coronavirus itself. That such opportunities would be non-existent in a decentralised model of data storage only further supports the argument that the adoption of a centralised model for the Aarogya Setu App is not driven by purposes related to containing the spread of Covid-19. Additionally, it shows why the data retention limits of the Aarogya Setu programme do not apply to anonymised and aggregated datasets. Therefore, there is a greater need for public scrutiny on this front.\nThe Sunset Clause Misses the Point\nThe Sunset Clause (Para 10) fails to adequately address temporal restrictions on the gathering of data by the Aarogya Setu Mobile Application. In fact, the sunset clause potentially allows for gathering such data on even more relaxed terms and conditions. Moreover, the Sunset Clause allows for its extension without any independent institutional review.\nMost importantly, the Sunset Clause is insufficient since there is no reference to the actual destruction of servers and systems created as an output of the Aarogya Setu programme. Without such a reference, a sunset clause is meaningless and evokes concerns of the creation of a permanent infrastructure of Government surveillance.\nConcluding Thoughts\nFor more, please go through our detailed analysis in which we deconstruct the various shortcomings of the Protocol. At the end we also analyse certain disclosures made by the Government in a press briefing made on the same day, which evoke concerns of interlinking of Government databases and risks of permanent systems of surveillance.\nImportant Documents\n Link to IFF’s Clause by Clause Analysis of the Aarogya Setu Protocol (link) Writ Petition filed in Jackson Mathew v.

IFF provided legal assistance for the petition filed by Jackson Mathew, Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which was accompanied by an expert affidavit by Professor Subhashis Banerjee from IIT Delhi. During the hearings, the Kerala High Court directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to file a reply and to state on record that data collected by the app will not be misused. The petitions are listed next on 18 May.\nDownload Aarogya Setu or Face Jail Time On 1 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued guidelines making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all persons in containment zones and all public and private sector employees. In case of the latter, the head of the organization has been made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among employees. These directions were issued by MHA under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA) and any violation is liable to be punished under Section 51, DMA (up to 2 years imprisionment) and Section 188, IPC (up to 6 months imprisonment).\nSince its launch, the Aarogya Setu app has been mired in controversy about its privacy and security practices, and we have analysed it in our working paper which provides privacy prescriptions for COVID-19 tech interventions. After the Aarogya Setu app was made mandatory for vast sections of society by MHA on 1 May 2020, John Daniel, the General Secretary of Congress Thissur District Committee filed a PIL before the Kerala High Court challenging the constitutionality of these directions. Yesterday, another writ petition was filed by Jackson Mathew, the Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which employs 50 people against Aarogya Setu being made compulsory through the threat of criminal sanction. The petition filed by Jackson Mathew is accompanied by an expert affidavit by Dr. Subhashis Banerjee, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi which highlights utility and privacy concerns with the Aarogya Setu app. IFF retained counsels provided assistance for this petition.\nAfter the petition was filed by Jackson Mathew yesterday morning, the government has released a data access and knowledge sharing protocol for the app. We will shortly be posting an analysis of the protocol and its failure to address concerns about legality, purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency and accountability.\nContagion of Technosolutionism Despite serious concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 surveillance apps, governments across the world have tried to leverage these apps to contain the spread of the virus. As Susan Landau notes, when you have a hammer, it is tempting to see nails everywhere but India doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have the level of smartphone and internet penetration required for such apps to even be theoretically effective. In a country where only 25% of the population has access to bluetooth enabled smartphones, the government has made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for accessing essential services like railways and this will have a devastating exclusionary impact.\nIn addition to this, bluetooth and GPS signals are not an accurate estimate of whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) with a COVID-19 infected person. This can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives which end up causing more harm than good. For instance, bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives.\n\u0026ldquo;Privacy by Design\u0026rdquo; Not Despite the government repeatedly claiming that the Aarogya Setu app does not raise any privacy or security concerns, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the app tell a very different story. The writ petition filed by Jackson Mathew analyses these issues in great detail but in brief, the Aarogya Setu app violates the following data protection principles:\n LegalityThe Aarogya Setu app which collects sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians has been launched without any governing legislative framework. The Disaster Management Act does not provide legislative basis for deployment of the Aarogya Setu app because it does not include any provisions for collection and processing of personal data. Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection has also explained that making Aarogya Setu mandatory without an enabling legislation is completely illegal. He also pointed out that the protocol issued by the government cannot substitute legislation by the parliament. ConsentBased on MIT Tech Review’s Tracker, India is the only democratic country which has made use of COVID-19 surveillance apps mandatory. Other countries which have made such apps mandatory are China and Turkey. However, in Turkey, only confirmed COVID-19 patients have to mandatorily download the app. ******Purpose Limitation and Data Sharing:******Clause 2(a) of the Privacy Policy states personal data collected at the time of registration can be used for “medical and administrative interventions necessary” in relation to COVID-19. This suggets that data collected by the app can be used for lockdown/quarantine enforcement. This is inconsistent with global best practices. For instance, the European Commission has clearly stated that data collected by COVID-19 surveillance apps should not be used for law enforcement or commercial purposes. Data MinimizationAarogya Setu collects location data through GPS and it can be used to track real time movements of individuals. This violates the principle of data minimization because location data is not necessary to determine if a user was in proximity of a COVID-19 positive person and bluetooth signals are sufficient for this purpose. SecurityThe Aarogya Setu app anonymizes data by assigning each user a static device identifier. This kind of weak anonymization has been highlighted as a significant privacy concern by Professor Subhashis Banerjee in his expert affidavit. He notes that unlike other apps which issue new tokens to be used as a fresh ID after pre-specified time intervals, Aarogya Setu uses a static device identifier. This combined with the fact that Aarogya Setu collects several other data points including meta data, makes the app vulnerable to an attack where users can identify other users who have been determined by the app -rightly or wrongly - as high risk spreaders. TransparencyClause 3 of the Terms of Service prohibits reverse engineering of the app which means that security researchers cannot independently study it to perform good faith vulnerability disclosure. The government has also refused to provide any technical specifications of the Aarogya Setu app. In contrast, other countries like Singapore, Israel and Australia have published the source code of their apps and other technical specifications relating to cryptography and bluetooth. AccountabilityClause 6 of the Terms of Service exempt the government from any liability for a person’s inability to access the app, inaccurate information about COVID-19 status of persons in one’s proximity and any breach of user data. Clause 7 of the Terms of Service further states that the government makes no warranties about the app’s accuracy and that such services are never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs.  What happened at today\u0026rsquo;s hearing? The PIL filed by John Daniel was listed before a Division Bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman and Justice MR Anitha as Item No. 8 and it came up for hearing around 11:30 AM. During the hearing, the counsel for the Petitioner sought interim relief to ensure that no coercive action was taken against anyone for failing to download the app. The counsel for MeitY insisted that Aarogya Setu was the best app in the world and emphasized that a protocol had also been issued to address privacy concerns. The bench was disinclined to intervene at this stage because \u0026ldquo;extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures\u0026rdquo;. However, the bench directed the government to file a statement on record that the data collected by the app will not be misused and listed the matter on 18 May.\nThe Writ Petition filed by Jackson Mathew was listed before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Gopinathan as Item 71 and it came up for hearing around 5:15 PM. During the hearing, Justice Gopinathan enquired about the previous proceeding before the Division Bench. Advocate Santhosh Mathew appearing for the Petitioner explained that this petition was not a PIL and highlighted the practical difficulties faced by the petitioner who would have to purchase smartphones for his employees and check whether they were using the Aarogya Setu app or risk criminal prosecution. The counsel appearing for MeitY once again insisted that the Aarogya Setu app is supposed to help the government fight COVID-19 and unless a large part of the population downloads it, the app will not be effective. In response, Advocate Santhosh Mathew emphasized on the aspect of criminal penalities and noted that even the Registrar or Chief Justice could be liable for imprisionment if any of the High Court employees failed to download Aarogya Setu. Justice Gopinathan acknowledged that this was a valid concern and he directed the counsel for MeitY to get instructions and file a statement on these aspects. This petition will be listed next on 18 May along with the petition filed by John Daniel before the Division Bench.\nAdvocate Santhosh Mathew and his team comprising of Advocates Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Vijay Paul and Jaisy Elza Joe led this important court intervention. Lawyers, Gautam Bhatia and Abhinav Sekhri, IFF retained counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay and Sidharth Deb also provided drafting and research assistance for this petition.\nImportant Documents:  Writ Petition filed in Jackson Mathew v.

This was in a petition filed by the Foundation by Media Professionals with two other petitioners. The Court directed the immediate constitution of a high-powered Special Committee which will be looking into the contentions of the Petitioners for 4G restoration in Jammu and Kashmir. Practically this means that 4G services will be restored in a phased manner and require further advocacy and time. While, we cannot imagine what people in Jammu and Kashmir will be feeling today \u0026mdash; we request them to maintain faith during these times. We commit on our part to relentlessly continue to work for 4G restoration by making urgent and prompt representations before this Special Committee and effectively push for larger legal reform on internet shutdowns.\nBackground When the Anuradha Bhasin judgement (which originally dealt with the challenge to the telecommunications blockade in Jammu and Kashmir) was pronounced on 10.01.2020, we clearly spelt out that this was a case which would require rigorous, follow-up work [read more here]. To realize it\u0026rsquo;s potential, we continued to advise one of the intervenors in the case, namely the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) and subsequently two representations were sent on 31.02.2020 and on 27.03.2020 to urge full restoration of connectivity, including 4G services in Jammu and Kashmir.\nSpurred by the inaction on 4G restoration and the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic which brought unique risks, connectivity to high speed internet became a health care priority. Due to this after conferences with FMP, legal counsel approached the Supreme Court on 30.03.2020 pressing for full internet connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir both as a humanitarian and a fundamental rights issue [read the petition]. The pleadings and the written submissions demonstrate the stark and dire impact on the people residing in these regions who have been deprived of 4G internet connectivity during this pandemic. From medical healthcare for the elderly to lack of remote learning for school children and young adults. This petition also contained the testimonies of people from the region and an expert affidavit on the differences between 2G and 4G connectivity.\nWe also sought collectively to address the concerns on national security which were raised by the State Government and the Union of India in our responses from the lens of objectivity and facts. As with all materials they are available on our website and listed below.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s order and intention for further action Based on inputs from counsel we understand the Supreme Court [judgement link] has held the following: ****\n Balancing of human rights and national security: The case has raised an important issue on national security and human rights; and both have to be reasonably and defensibly be balanced. The Court has noticed that in the Orders passed in each district of Jammu and Kashmir anomalies such as, \u0026ldquo;[a]lthough the present orders indicate that they have been passedfor a limited period of time, the order does not provide any reasonsto reflect that all the districts of the Union Territory of Jammu andKashmir require the imposition of such restrictions\u0026rdquo;. However, the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court further observes that they recognise the militancy problem in Jammu and Kashmir and competing considerations need to be calibrated. Constitution of a Special Committee : Since issues involved affect the state and nation, the existing review committee will not be able to assess the situation. Hence, a special committee will be immediately constituted comprising of the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Technology, and the Jammu and Kashmir Chief Secretary. It will examine representations made by the Petitioners. To this all existing petitions will be sent for immediate consideration.  Practically this means that 4G services will most likely be considered by this Special Committee that will look, \u0026ldquo;into the prevailing circumstances\u0026hellip; immediately\u0026rdquo; [Para 23]. The court in its parting paragraph has also noted that,\n \u0026ldquo;24. The Special Committee is directed to examine the contentions of, and the material placed herein by, the Petitioners as well as the Respondents. The aforesaid Committee must also examine the appropriateness of the alternatives suggested by the Petitioners, regarding limiting the restrictions to those areas where it is necessary and the allowing of faster internet (3G or 4G) on a trial basis over certain geographical areas and advise the Respondent No. 1 regarding the same, in terms of our earlier directions.\u0026rdquo;\n We are determined to relentlessly continue to work for 4G restoration especially given the central role of internet connectivity in mitigating the injury of the Covid-19 pandemic. This will not only be through making representations to this special committee but also by examining wider policy side reforms to the legal framework which permits internet shutdowns and network disruptions in India.\nThe fight for our digital rights will not be easy and victories will come incrementally and thier tangible benefit will be realised in time. They will test our patience, perseverance and require us to be relentless in our efforts. We hope to implement it working in collaboration with collectives, groups and other organisations with honesty, belief and strategy.\nWe will continue our work with a sense of mission. We commit this to you.\nCredits Roll IFF provided legal assistance to the Foundation for Media Professionals for this petition and we are extremely grateful to the entire legal team led by Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi and comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia, Apar Gupta and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay.

As per prior analysis, since such applications are without a legal basis or have any enforceable limitation are a, \u0026ldquo;privacy minefield\u0026rdquo;. Now, because they are being made mandatory it is leading to second order harms such as exclusion. Non-compliance from installation of Aarogya Setu can also potentially lead to criminal prosecution. Due to this and more, it is incredibly important that the Standing Committee commence urgent hearings.\nBackground Yesterday we studied two significant developments, that have spurred the present intervention.\n UK report : On May 6 a report on the contact tracing application in the United Kingdom by the House of Commons. This report clearly stated that, “the government must not roll out the contact tracing app” and, “Government assurances about intended privacy protections for any data collected do not carry any weight unless the Government is prepared to enshrine these protections in legislation..” (link). We have made a similar recommendation in our working paper (link). Standing committee may soon resume functioning: The appropriate body to commence a similar study and author a report is the Standing Committee for Information Technology. The Standing Committee on IT is a parliamentary committee that is actively looking at the issue of, \u0026ldquo;citizens data security and privacy\u0026rdquo; (link). While this body is not actively meeting at present due to the Covid pandemic, yesterday as per a press release the Rajya Sabha Chairman and Lok Sabha Speaker have commenced a process to examine the feasibility of remote meetings (link hat-tip Arun PS).  Spurred by this, and given our consistent engagement with parliamentary committees and legislators, we swung into action.\nLack of privacy, legality, transparency due to Aarogya Setu Today, we wrote to the Standing Committee for Information Technology on the specific issue of any clear legal basis or legislative framework for the several contact tracing apps, notably Aarogya Setu.\nWe pointed out that:\n Impact on privacy: Many of these smartphone applications have a direct impact on individual privacy and have been documented at length in a working paper published by us earlier(link). This comprehensive working paper made in the style of a “Brandeis Brief”, surveys expert literature, contains India specific analysis and while is still in a process of development to account for subsequent events, hopefully may provide a credible basis for analysis to our legislators. Lack of legislative framework: Specifically with respect to contract tracing many smartphone applications have been launched by State and Central Governments without any underlying legal legislative framework, they suffer from issues of transparency (for eg. source code is not open sourced and there is a lack of clarity on contract conditions and service rules for the “volunteers” developing it) and further lack any feasibility reports. This is in direct violation of the fundamental right to privacy as analysed with respect to the flagship application, Aarogya Setu (link) which is being developed by the National Informatics Center (NIC) (t_hat is also avoiding transparency by being evasive to RTI queries)_. Mass surveillance and exclusion: Further, the installation of such contact tracing applications which cause mass surveillance is now being made mandatory under threat of criminal penalties. Due to this more than 45 organisations, including trade unions and more than 100 prominent individuals have endorsed a joint representation to the Ministry for Home Affairs (link).  Our request for action In our letter we have requested for urgent hearings to be conducted. These should specially involve medical health professionals, academics from IITs and digital rights and public policy experts. Such hearings may focus not only on the privacy impacts but also the feasibility and exclusion caused by such contact tracing apps which are by their very nature mass surveillance measures.\nWe also stated that there is an urgent need for the Committee for engagement with the Government in order to obtain clarity and public disclosure on this deep violation of human rights. We have asked that significant Government officials - especially from the National Informatics Center (NIC) and other relevant government agencies and law enforcement - be invited to depose before the Committee in order to obtain transparency through official disclosure of the source code, product architecture and all official files including the service contracts and rules executed with the developers who are being classified as, \u0026ldquo;volunteers\u0026rdquo; in press reports.\nOur final request is that that the Committee on IT to consider the suitability of a legislative framework given the feasibility of Contact Tracing itself is under growing doubt even while mass surveillance and exclusion (to livelihood or use of public facilities) caused is certain. We hope an objective, evidence based parliamentary report authored on the basis of expert inputs can help advance institutional engagement on the wide, pervasive and harmful impacts on our fundamental rights through smartphone applications such as Aarogya Setu that are increasingly being made mandatory under threat of criminal penalties.\nImportant Documents:  Letter on issues of data privacy and security on contact tracing applications dated May 8, 2020 [link] Joint representation by 45 organisations against the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu [link] Our comparative analysis of the Aarogya Setu App [link] Working paper on Privacy Impacts by Technology Interventions around Covid-19 in India [link]  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/get-up-stand-up-for-our-privacy-rights/","summary":"We wrote to the Standing Committee for Information Technology to hold hearings on Aarogya Setu.","title":"Committee on IT : Get up!

Through this representation, we have tried to provide a broader picture of inadequacies in the existing legal and institutional framework to address these problems and highlighted the role of patriarchal socio-cultural attitudes in emboldening young boys to commit such acts. We have also made nine specific recommendations to ensure the internet remains a safe space for young girls and women where they are allowed to participate on an equal basis and express themselves freely.\nBackground In a recent headline grabbing incident, teenage male students from Delhi were called out for sharing sexualized images of young women including girls below the age of 18 years on an Instagram group called \u0026lsquo;Boiz Locker Room.\u0026rsquo; Media reports suggest that the boys used the group to sexualize images posted by girls on their social media accounts and even shared morphed images. More disturbingly, reports indicate that in addition to non-consensually sharing images, the boys made misogynistic remarks objectifying the girls and even threatened to leak nude images of the girls who exposed the group.\nNeed for Accountability and Rehabilitation We, at IFF, have consistently sought reform of India\u0026rsquo;s obscenity laws which are rooted in notions of victorian morality rather than individual autonomy and consent. However, online image based sexual abuse is very different from consensual pornography and it subjects women to immense psychological trauma and social stigma. Therefore, there exists a legitimate need to prohibit and punish such harmful conduct.\nNevertheless, we must be wary of adopting punitive and carceral approaches in cases where the perpetrators are minors and there is no accompanying violence. For young offenders, the focus must be on re-education and rehabilitation, and we must acknowledge the role played by patriarchal socio-cultural attitudes which teach boys to objectify and dehumanize women from a young age.\nLack of Institutional Capacity The government has established helplines, online portals and special investigative units to address cyber crimes against women and children but these measures have failed to result in greater reporting, investigation and prosecution of online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material. As per the National Crime Records Bureau’s latest Crime in India Report, there were only 862 cases registered under Section 67A (publication of sexually explicit material) and Section 67B (publication of sexually explicit material depicting children) of the IT Act in 2018. Similarly, only 781 cases were registered under Section 14 and 15 (storage and possession of child pornography) of the POCSO Act in 2018.\nThese figures are shockingly low considering India’s large population, growing internet user base and the relatively higher number of cases reported for other cybercrimes. The scope of the problem is much larger than these figures indicate as out of the total 16.9 million reports received by the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States in 2019, India accounted for 1,987,430 suspected child sexual exploitation reports. Therefore, proactive information disclosure and performance audits are absolutely necessary to ensure that existing mechanisms to eliminate online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material are functioning effectively.\nRights Respecting Solutions In our representation, we have stressed that governments should not force intermediaries to adopt rights harming measures such as weakening of encryption standards. We had also previously highlighted these concerns in our submission to the Ad Hoc Rajya Sabha Committee on the impact of pornography on children headed by Shri Jairam Ramesh.\nIt is our belief that strong encryption is necessary to protect the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and government actors who use the internet, and this is especially true for groups which lack social power such as women and other marginalized communities. Any weakening of encryption standards would leave us all vulnerable to misuse of our personal data and communications by bad actors including malicious hackers, organized criminals, terrorist groups and hostile nation states. The importance of security and privacy enhancing technologies like encryption for women is also borne out of past experience of hackers targeting accounts of women to access their private photos. For instance, in 2014, hackers leaked over 500 private photos of various female celebrities by breaching iCloud’s services. Therefore, any decision to weaken the security of our intimate communications by mandating weak encryption standards or creation of backdoors would leave women even more vulnerable to online image based sexual abuse.\nFinal Recommendations In the spirit of constructive solution oriented engagement, we have offered the following nine recommendations to ensure the internet is a safe space for women and young girls where they are allowed to participate on an equal basis and express themselves freely:\n  Seek information from authorities responsible for facilitating reporting of online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material about the number of complaints received from individuals, intermediaries, watchdog groups and international law enforcement agencies.    Seek information from authorities responsible for investigating and prosecuting online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material about the number of complaints in which follow up action was taken such as investigation, identification of perpetrators and filing of criminal charges.    Conduct an audit to evaluate the performance of existing helplines, online reporting portals and specialized investigation units.    Provide more funding, personnel and technical resources to existing helplines, online portals and specialized investigation units after an assessment of their needs.    Work closely with schools and colleges to create a Standard Operating Procedure [SOP] which provides safe spaces for young girls and women to report such illegal behaviour in a manner which does not invite larger social stigma and also provides them the agency to choose the next steps they feel comfortable with.    Encourage intermediaries to adhere to industry best practices for eliminating online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material which may require deployment of specialized software or fast-tracking human review by content moderators in such cases.    Any technical measures adopted to address online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material should not undermine the privacy and security of all users by weakening encryption. Instead, the focus should be on capacity building and providing adequate resources to law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute these offences.    Ensure that students receive mandatory and regular gender sensitization and sex education in their schools which is centered on the principles of consent and women’s autonomy.    Consider partnerships with women’s rights groups, child rights groups, digital rights groups and social networks to collaboratively work towards leveraging technology to sensitise young people and parents about healthy sexual conduct and behaviour.   In the end, we would like to acknowledge that a lot of our work on issues like online harassment is shaped by prior research done by other digital rights organizations like the Internet Democracy Project, Point of View and Centre for Internet \u0026amp; Society and we would urge you to follow their work as well!\nImportant Documents:  Representation dated 06.05.2020 to WCD Ministry and DCW (link) Representation dated 08.01.2020 to Rajya Sabha Committee on impact of pornography on children (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/the-internet-shouldnt-be-a-boys-club/","summary":"We wrote to the WCD Ministry and DCW about the need to address image based sexual abuse  on the internet in a rights respecting manner in light of the\nrecent \u0026lsquo;Boiz Locker Room\u0026rsquo; incident.","title":"The Internet Should Not Become a Boys Club"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Earlier today we facilitated a legal challenge to the Noida Authorities to revoke the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu under a threat of criminal imprisonment. As per a legal order those residing or entering Noida have been compelled to install Aarogya Setu. Failing to have Aarogya Setu on your phone would be criminally prosecuted under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. To contest this egregious breach of personal liberty, we commenced proceedings of challenge through Ritwik who is an advocate based and residing in Noida. We are making the contents of this representation public to facilitate more people to file similar challenges to Section 144 orders which may arise in different parts of India.\nA path to health, or to jail? The Government\u0026rsquo;s contact tracing app Aarogya Setu literally means a path to health. But as we explained those who do not install it now risk being criminally prosecuted. This is through a direction issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on which more than 45 organisations and 100 individuals have asked for an urgent review.\nTo make this direction actionable, the Noida administration issued an order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 compelling those residing or entering Noida to install Aarogya Setu failing which they would be criminally prosecuted under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. This order was also tweeted by the Police Authorities. A copy of it is linked below.\nWe have detailed concerns and recommendations on the privacy and second order injuries caused by Aarogya Setu. To us it is a, \u0026ldquo;privacy minefield\u0026rdquo;. From the lack of legality and safeguards there are good, practical reasons (such as it\u0026rsquo;s impact on the battery life of users, or just not having a smartphone) why many people will refrain from having Aarogya Setu. To put is plainly, to criminally prosecute people for not installing a smartphone application even at the time of a pandemic is illegal. Due to this, we were compelled to take steps to challenge this order.\nA Section 144(5) Challenge To activate a challenge to this order, a terse representation was drafted today by Abhinav Sekhri, Advocate to activate a legal process to ensure the personal liberty of all residents of Noida and those who may be seeking to enter it.\nThis representation is made under Section 144(5) of the CrPC by Ritwick a Advocate and a resident of Noida. The primary grounds of challenge are as follows:\n Contrary to law: Section 144 Orders cannot impose positive obligations on persons to do certain acts, such as download and install an App on their Smartphone, but only direct them to “abstain from a certain act”. Reference may be had to a decision of the Calcutta High Court in Emperor v. B.N. Sasmal [ILR (1930) 58 Cal 1037] where orders under Section 144 directing a person to leave the district were struck down as illegal, and the Court noted that “The very reason why the section uses the language ‘abstain from a certain act’ is just because it is not intended to empower magistrates to make positive orders requiring people to do particular things.” This position was also upheld in Ramanlal Patel [1971 Cri LJ 435]. Contrary to fact: The Impugned Order is also contrary to fact. It is clear that the Advisory issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs requires 100% installation of the “Aarogya Setu App” within Containment Zones and nowhere else (Para 3 of the Advisory). The entirety of District Gautam Buddha Nagar has not been declared a “Containment Zone” as per the notifications issued by the State Government, but only a “Red Zone”, where 100% installation of “Aarogya Setu App” is not required as per Lockdown Directives. Violation of privacy and personal liberty: The Impugned Order amounts to an unconstitutional breach of the fundamental right to privacy secured under Article 21. The “Aarogya Setu App” collects personal data in the form of medical information to which a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches as identified by the Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy [(2017) 10 SCC 1]. Any sharing of such information requires clear consent, which is missing from prohibitory orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. which work on a threat of prosecution.  A ready template (but, not legal advice) To enable more people \u0026ndash; not only residents of Noida – to prefer similar challenges we are making a copy of this representation available in google docs so it may serve as a template for necessary action. While this does not constitute legal advice, we hope it accelerates the pace of citizen collaboration to safeguard individual privacy and personal liberty.\nWe will actively work to ensure that such orders that imperil you do not go unchallenged. As a public centred organisation, IFF will conduct rapid responses and relentlessly champion your right to privacy through this pandemic.\nImportant Documents  Prohibitory Order under Section 144 dated May 3, 2020 [link] Representation under Section 144(5) dated May 6, 2020 [PDF and Google Docs] Joint representation by 45 organisations against the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu [link] Our comparative analysis of the Aarogya Setu App [link]  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/we-contest-the-noida-authorities-direction-that-may-make-aarogya-setu-a-path-to-jail/","summary":"Earlier today we facilitated a legal challenge to the Noida Authorities to revoke the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu under a threat of criminal imprisonment.","title":"We legally contest the Noida authorities order of criminally prosecuting people who do not have Aarogya Setu #SaveOurPrivacy"},{"content":"  Tl;dr Today, the Supreme Court heard substantive arguments regarding the constitutionality and legality of internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions were imposed through orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 which directed Internet Service Providers to slow down mobile internet speed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to 2G only. These internet slowdown orders were challenged before the Supreme Court by the Foundation for Media Professionals, Private School Association of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and Soayib Qureshi. During today’s hearing, counsels for the petitioners highlighted the impact of the internet slowdown on access to healthcare and education in the region and the Government sought to justify the restrictions by citing national security concerns. After hearing arguments for nearly three hours, the three judge bench has reserved judgement in the matter.\nBackground On 31 March 2020, the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) filed a petition before the Supreme Court challenging restriction of mobile internet speed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to 2G only during the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir were also subsequently challenged by the Private School Association for Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and Soayib Qureshi. These petitions were listed for hearing before a three judge bench of Ramana J., Gavai J. and Reddy J. which had also heard the previous challenge against the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 05 August 2019 at the time of abrogation of Article 370 which provided a special status to the former state.\nThrough their pleadings and oral arguments, the petitioners highlighted the impact of the internet slowdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the COVID-19 lockdown on access to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice. These contentions were supported by personal narratives from doctors, teachers, students, business persons and lawyers in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and a technical comparison of web performance at 2G and 4G speed (Read more here).\nThe petitioners further submitted that restriction of mobile internet speed to 2G only did not satisfy the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in its judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India **** because the State had failed to demonstrate that imposing internet restrictions on an entire population for over 9 months was the suitable, least restrictive and proportionate method of addressing terrorism during a public health crisis. To demonstrate this, the petitioners cited empirical research which suggested that internet shutdowns were counterproductive and could lead to more violence and recommended less restrictive alternatives such as blocking of specific websites. The petitioners also relied on the State’s own data to demonstrate that terrorist activity in the region has continuously decreased since 1990 despite the introduction of smartphones and high speed internet. These factual and legal arguments have been explained in greater detail in the written submissions filed by Foundation for Media Professionals and you can read more here.\nThe Government’s stance In its counter-affidavit and during oral arguments, the Government repeatedly invoked national security concerns to justify the internet slowdown. It cited the history of cross border terrorism in the region to explain why internet restrictions were necessary to prevent disemmination of fake news by terrorists which could incite the public. However, if this argument about the region’s geo-political history was taken to its logical conclusion, it would mean that internet restrictions in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir would be permanent and this was expressly ruled out by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India. Further, misinformation is a pan-India problem but other states have not resorted to blanket internet restrictions and instead relied on post facto take down and prosecution.\nIn its counter-affidavit, the Government also made mutually contradictory statements about the internet being slow enough to foil the activities of terrorists but also being fast enough to not hamper the activities of ordinary citizens. For instance, it argued that terrorists would not be able to upload or download heavy data files at 2G speed but that somehow students will be able to continue their education through e-learning apps and videos at 2G speed. The Government also claimed that resources by the Ministry of Health and World Health Organization could be easily accessed at 2G speed despite technical simulations demonstrating that interactive resources like the WHO’s situation tracker do not work at observed 2G speeds at all.\nThe Government further argued that it had taken ameliorative measures to ensure people could access COVID-19 related information and continue their education despite lack of effective internet access. For instance, the Government claimed that it had established call centres to address people’s queries and classes were being broadcast on TV and radio for students. However, the Government did not address the petitioners’ arguments about how telemedicine was impossible without video facilities and how short one sided broadcasts cannot substitute a full day of interactive classes for students through video conference.\nWhat happened at today’s hearing? During today’s hearing, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, Senior Advocate for Foundation for Media Professionals began substantive arguments by highlighting how the internet slowdown during the COVID-19 crisis was undermining right to health because doctors could not access latest information or treat patients through telemedicine which requires video facilities. He also emphasized on the impact of internet restrictions on the right to education and the inability of students in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to continue their education using video conferencing tools. In response to a query by the bench about fixed line connections operating at normal speed, he emphasized that a very small number of people have fixed line connections compared to mobile internet and due to the lockdown, it was impossible for people to travel to another place to access a fixed line connection. Finally, he urged the bench to consider that besides making bald assertions, the government had failed to show a rational connection between 4G internet speed and terrorism in the first place, and in fact, the government’s own data suggested that there had been a substantial decline in terrorism since 1990 despite an increase in the number of internet users.\nMr. Salman Khurshid, Senior Advocate for Private School Association of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir focused on the impact of deprivation of 4G internet on the right to education and highlighted the inadequacy of one hour classes being broadcast on TV and radio. He further noted that the government had failed to publish the orders of the Review Committee which was responsible for determining the necessity and proportionality of continuing internet restrictions every seven working days. Mr. Soayib Qureshi appearing for himself echoed similar concerns and suggested that the Government should have used less restrictive alternatives such as blocking specific websites.\nMr. KK Venugopal, the Attorney General and Mr. Tushar Mehta, the Solicitor General appearing for the Government argued that even during a pandemic, national security concerns should be paramount and the executive branch should be the sole decision maker in such matters. They also submitted that the petitioners’ concerns were unwarranted because many Indians do not have smartphones or access to the internet but there have been no reports of anyone dying on account of lack of internet access.\nAfter hearing extensive arguments from all parties for nearly 3 hours over video conferencing, the 3 judge bench has reserved its order in the matter.\nCredits Roll IFF provided legal assistance to the Foundation for Media Professionals for this petition and we are extremely grateful to the entire legal team led by Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi and comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia, Apar Gupta and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay.

This joint representation becomes all the more urgent given yesterday\u0026rsquo;s direction by the Home Ministry for the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu and for it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;100% coverage\u0026rdquo; especially in all workplaces. Violation of this direction can lead to criminal penalties thereby Aarogya Setu now not only impacts the data privacy of workers, or can lead to risks of exclusion and misidentification, a person not having it on their phone can also be charged with a criminal offence. This marks a dramatic and clear shift in government policy on Aarogya Setu from, \u0026ldquo;encouragement\u0026rdquo; towards coercion and increases the legitimacy of the demands articulated by the joint representation.\nA joint representation co-signed by 45 organisations and more than 100 people In yesterday\u0026rsquo;s post we released a joint representation signed by 37 organisations and 75 individuals against mandating the use of the Aarogya Setu on workers. After we opened it for further sign-ons this number has grown to 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals who have expressed solidarity against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on workers. The endorsements are from a broad swathe of Indian society including trade unions, people\u0026rsquo;s movements, digital rights organizations, public health experts, former civil servants and bureaucrats, activists, academics, technologists, journalists, lawyers etc.\nA copy of the joint representation was sent today with a covering letter to the Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s Office with a copy to Ministry of Home Affairs and other central government ministries.\nTo this we attached a covering letter dated May 2, 2020 which further notes with concern yesterday evening\u0026rsquo;s development of the issuance of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) has been issued on May 1, 2020 around 6:00 PM by the Ministry of Home Affairs requiring mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu. This goes against the core demands of the joint representation which is attached to this covering letter.\nAarogya Setu : Not only mandatory but also criminal penalties The Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A), which has been issued under Section 10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates for the mandatory installation and operation of Aarogya Setu in two specific ways:\n First, after classification of the districts into three zones, for the Red (Hotspots) Zones, a further sub-classification has been made for, “containment zones”. As per the Order under Section 3(iii), “The local authority shall ensure 100% coverage of Aarogya Setu app among the residents of Containment Zones”. Second, at Para 15(i) further reference is made for, “all the district magistrates” to, “strictly enforce the lockdown measures” for, “public and workplaces, as specified in Annexure I”. This direction extends to all three zones. Annexure I further states at Point No. 15 that, “Use of Aarogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public. It shall be responsibility of the Head of the respective Organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among employees”.  Presently here are no exceptions or conditionality provided in these directions which place emphasis on 100% coverage in effect meaning total and complete mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu for all workers, all across the country. The order further indicates criminal penalties for non-compliance in Paragraph No. 16 that states, “Any person violating these lockdown measures and the National Directives for Covid-19 Management will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provision of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC and other legal provisions as applicable”. The specific provision that may be attracted for prosecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is Section 51(b) that provides for a maximum punishment of up to 1 year for disobedience, and 2 years when such actions may lead to a loss of life. The penalty for conviction under Section 188 of the IPC extends to 6 months imprisonment.\nHence, the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu is not only an issue of data privacy but second order harms which spring from it now includes loss of urban mobility, use of public spaces and transit, livelihood and personal liberty for millions of Indians all over India. Specially those without smartphones devices given the lack of any exemption categories.\nIntention for further action We at IFF in continuation of this Joint Representation dated May 1, 2020 and through this covering letter have requested specific review of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) and will also be shortly reaching out to each one of the co-signees and collaborators urging them to send individual letters of concern as much as examine further advocacy actions against this grave breach.\nWe also remain open to any suggestions and advice on what we can do better, or different not only through our collaborators, but even members of the public. We invite you to write to us, or discuss these issues over at the Internet Freedom Forum.\nAs stated before we at IFF will continue conducting public advocacy, awareness especially through digital media as well as continue to engage pro-actively with all government institutions on the issues concerning Aarogya Setu. This includes representations, RTI requests as well as other legal remedies which may be examined at an appropriate stage in consultation with IFF\u0026rsquo;s legal team and several lawyers who continue to volunteer thier time and labour towards protecting fundamental rights.\nFinal list of signatories The full list of 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals who have expressed solidarity against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu through the Joint Representation dated 01.05.2020 sent to the Government is given below:\n   Organisation Name     Access Now   ADF India   All India Central Council of Trade Unions   All India Union of Forest Working People   Amnesty India   Asia Dalit Rights Forum   Association for Progressive Communications   Association for Protection of Democratic Rights   Bachchao Project   Chennai Metropolitan Construction and Unorganised Workers Union   Common Cause   Delhi Solidarity Group   Digital Empowerment Foundation   Feminism in India   Forum Against Oppression of Women, Bombay   Foundation for Media Professionals   Free Software Community of India   Human Rights Law Network   Indian Delivery Lions Organization   Indian Federation of App Transport Workers   Indian Journalists Union   Indian Social Action Forum   Indic Project   Internet Democracy Project   Internet Freedom Foundation   Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, Mumbai   Jharkhand Nagrik Prayas   LABIA - A Queer Feminist LBT Collective   Medianama   Metacept   Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan   National Alliance of People’s Movements   National Adivasi Alliance   National Fishworkers' Forum   Pakistan-India Peoples' Forum for Peace \u0026amp; Democracy, India Chapter   Point of View   Pothe Ebar Namo Sathi   Project Constitutionalism   People’s Union of Civil Liberties   People’s Union for Democratic Rights   Red Dot Foundation   Socialist Party of India   Swathanthra Malayalam Computing   Tandem Research   United Christian Forum       Individual Name Profession/Affiliation     Abha Bhaiya One Billion Rising   Abhinav Anand Student   Akram Parvez Technical Art Director   Ammu Abraham PUCL Maharashtra   Anand Patwardhan Film Maker   Ankur Sarin Faculty, IIM Ahmedabad   Anuradha Kapoor Feminist Activist   Arun PS Policy Researcher   Ashish Ghosh Retired Teacher, University of Delhi   Asis Kumar Das Social Activist   Avani Chokshi Advocate   Basawa Prasad Kunale Advocate   Brijesh Kumar Former Secretary, Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology   Brinda Adige Ananya Mahila Okkutta   Ch Narendra Senior Journalist   Chayanika Shah Queer Feminist Writer and Researcher   Chitra R Educator   Darshan R Software Engineer   Deepak Mukarji Founder Member, United Christian Front   Dr Shakeel Physician   Dr. Mira Shiva Public Health Physician   Dr.Mohan Rao Former Professor, Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health,   Dr.Tusharkanti Dey Community Health Adviser (Retired), All India Institute of Hygiene \u0026amp; Public Health   Felix Padel Anthropologist and Author   Gautam Bhatia Advocate   Geeta Seshu Free Speech Collective   Gurbir Singh President, Mumbai Press Club   Gurshabad Grover Technology and Law Researcher   Harsh Kapoor South Asia Citizens Web   Indira Unninayar Advocate   Irfan Engineer Director, Centre for Study of Society and Secularism   Janaki Srinivasan IIIT-Bangalore   Japleen Pasricha Feminist Activist and Entrepreneur   John Dayal Former President, All India Catholic Union   Kalyani Menon Sen Feminist Learning Partnerships   Kannan Gopinathan Former IAS Officer and Activist   KP Sasi Film Maker   Kunal Majumdar Committee to Protect Journalists   Leo Saldanha Researcher   Madhu Bhaduri Retired IFS Officer   Madhu HS Chartered Accountant   Maitreyi Krishnan Advocate   Manoj Mitta Journalist and President, FMP   Mary Mathai Former Chemist and Homemaker   Meena Gupta Retired Civil Servant   Megha Garg Gandhi Fellow   Nachiket Udupa Activist   Nadika N Writer and Researcher   Nidhi Agarwal Activist   Nikhil Naren Advocate and Author   Oishik Sircar Associate Professor, Jindal Global Law School   Padmini Ray Murray Design Beku Design Beku   Pamela Philipose Journalist Journalist   Paranjoy Guha Thakurta Journalist and Filmmaker   Prabha Nagaraja TARSHI   Pradeep Esteves Context India   Prajval Shastri Astrophysicist   Prof. Sandeep Kumar Shukla Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur   R Ramanujam Professor, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai   Rahim Contractor Civil Engineer   Rajinder Chaudhary Former Professor, Department of Economics, M.

This is specifically focussed for workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Aarogya Setu app which was initially touted as a voluntary measure has been made effectively been made mandatory for gig workers and government employees. This is despite failing to adhere to data protection standards and lacking algorithmic accountability. Today, an important joint representation signed by 37 organisations including labour unions, and 75 prominent individuals have endorsed a joint representation urging the government to issue an advisory clarifying that use of Aarogya Setu cannot be made mandatory and also recommends financial relief, protective equipment and healthcare coverage for gig workers during the COVID-19 related lockdown.\nSchrödinger\u0026rsquo;s App: Voluntary but also Mandatory! On 02 April 2020, the government launched a contact tracing app (which now is building even an e-pass functionality) called Aarogya Setu which has been heavily criticized for failing to adhere to data protection principles of lawfulness, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency and accountability. IFF has previously published a working paper which explains the problems with Aarogya Setu in great detail and you can read about it here. This working paper is being updated to account for subsequent changes but its fundamental concerns and recommendations about the problematic nature of Aarogya Setu remain valid.\nWhile there were initial assurances that use of Aarogya Setu is voluntary, it was soon made compulsory for employees of Prasar Bharati and Central Armed Police Forces. However, even the army seems to have data security concerns about Aarogya Setu and it has instructed its officers to not use the app at work. Since this representation was drafted and circulated, the government has made Aarogya Setu mandatory for all central government employees and reports suggest that it may soon be pre-installed on all new smartphones.\nIn addition to government employees, certain private companies in the gig economy have also made Aarogya Setu mandatory for their workers. As lockdown restrictions are eased and business operations resume, other employers in the gig economy as well as the traditional economy may make use of the app compulsory for workers. Reports suggest that mandating use of Aarogya Setu may be a pre-emptive liability reduction measure by companies through draft guidelines for e-commerce which were privately circulated by the government mandate use of the app by all workers and hold the COO responsible for any violation.\nImpact on Gig Workers The Terms of Service of the Aarogya Setu app exempt the government from any liability for losses arising from misidentification of an individual\u0026rsquo;s COVID-19 status. This means that there is no remedy available if the app misidentifies a person as at risk of having COVID-19. This kind of misidentification can have serious consequences and it could force workers to self-isolate and lose their income and freedom of movement based on an opaque algorithm. Further, in the long term, Aarogya Setu could become a tool of mass surveillance and sensitive health and location data of workers could be used by law enforcement agencies for punitive purposes.\nIn addition to this, timely, important research done by Tandem Research and CIS, thas demonstrated the need for government to provide financial relief, protective equipment and healthcare coverage to gig workers who are struggling to make ends meet during the lockdown and face higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to exposure to multiple customers everyday. In light of these concerns, we have sought to support the rights of gig workers, a number which grows each day with greater adoption of smartphones across the country.\nJoint Representation to the Government Today, with the endorsement of 37 organisations and 75 individuals (till now), a joint representation will be sent at 7:00 PM to the Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s Office and the Ministries of Electronics \u0026amp; IT, Labour, Home Affairs and Transport. The representation urges the issuance of an advisory to clarify that Aarogya Setu cannot be made mandatory for workers in the gig economy as well as the traditional economy. To quote from it:\n \u0026ldquo;Considering the damaging impact of the Aarogya Setu app and COVID-19 lockdown on the privacy, autonomy and dignity of workers, we urge your office to undertake the below mentioned measures in collaboration with the private sector.\n  (a) Take cognizance of privacy concerns associated with Aarogya Setu and issue an advisory clarifying that use of the app should not be made mandatory for workers in the gig economy and also the traditional economy.\n  (b) In addition to (a), to ensure greater safety, rely on certain methods of risk mitigation such as working with companies to provide daily temperature checks and personal protective equipment to all gig and platform workers who continue working during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n  (c) Further, devise the right incentive structures both for companies and workers to ensure that gig and platform workers are able to sustain themselves during the lockdown and those displaying symptoms of COVID-19 are not forced to work to ensure their livelihood. This includes provisions for medical insurance and financial relief to all gig and platform workers who have been unable to work during the lockdown or have witnessed a significant decrease in earnings due to low demand.\u0026rdquo;\n A copy of the representation can be found here (English | Hindi). As stated before, the representation has so far been endorsed by 37 organisations and 75 individuals.\nIt is open for public endorsement till 7:00 PM today and you can endorse it by sending an email to policy@internetfreedom.in with the line, \u0026ldquo;I endorse the Representation against Mandatory Use of Aarogya Setu to protect privacy, autonomy and dignity of workers during COVID-19 outbreak.\u0026quot; Please mention your name and profession/organizational affiliation in the email.

We give a background on the Act and its provisions and how in times of increased government power it has led to more than 500 cases being lodged under it. We have also written to the Union Home Ministry to urgently issue an advisory to State Governments with a draft SOP, to tackle the menace of COVID-19 related disinformation without resorting to overzealous criminal prosecutions.\nBackground on Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897\nThe Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 was first enacted in the wake of the outbreak of the bubonic plague in India which gave the colonial government wide powers at the time. “This Act empowered the colonial authorities to detain the plague suspects, destroy or demolish infected property and dwellings, prohibit fairs and pilgrimages and examine the passengers at will.” The Act, as it stands currently as well, gives wide powers to the State government under S.2. It authorizes the State government to take any such measures or prescribe any such temporary regulations which it shall deem necessary to prevent the outbreak or further spread of the epidemic. This provides a wide ambit to the provision and one of the measures for which it is being used consistently is combating fake news.\nMisinformation through social media has been one of the toughest adversaries in the fight against COVID-19. Various stories about fake cures and solutions have been doing the rounds on the internet which include vibrations from clapping will kill the virus and that cow urine and cow dung can be used as cures. While the spread of fake news is itself problematic as it creates confusion, one of the most worrying trends of this pandemic is the spread of conspiracy theories which has led to a rise in communal violence.\nAccording to a status report filed by the Central government in the Supreme Court, “fake news causing serious panic, is the \u0026ldquo;single most unmanageable hindrance\u0026rdquo; in the management of this challenge.”. Our Executive Director, Apar Gupta has explained how this order of the Supreme Court undermines the right of journalists to report.\nRelevant legal provisions that cause concern\nThe legal provisions being invoked for criminal prosecutions of social media users that are being used as a means to curb the spread of fake news are illustrated below:\n Under S.3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act any person who disobeys any regulation or order made under the Act is punishable under S.188 of the IPC. For context, punishment under this section will be prescribed for violation of lockdown orders issued by the Central government under this Act. Under the S.188 of the IPC , a punishment of simple imprisonment for a term of six months is prescribed for whoever disobeys an order duly promulgated by a public servant. S.505(1)(b) of the IPC is another provision which is being invoked frequently. It prescribes a punishment of imprisonment which may extend to 3 years or fine or both for making, publishing or circulating any statement, rumor or report which may cause fear or alarm to the public. Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act also deals with creating ‘false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic’ which is punishable by imprisonment of upto one year.  Arrests for fake news\nAs reported in today’s (April 30, 2020) Hindustan Times, these legal provisions have been used to lodge at least close to 500 cases. This is a large number which matches a disturbing yet global trend of using criminal prosecutions as a preferred choice to tackle disinformation.\nSome illustrative cases include:\n Close to 100 arrests in West Bengal, “The arrested people include homemakers, students, school teachers, government employees and traders. The police are scanning social media pages, said Gyanwant Singh, the inspector general (law and order) of West Bengal Police.”**** “A health worker posted in Rajasthan\u0026rsquo;s Dausa district was arrested and his services were terminated for allegedly spreading fake news about the coronavirus”. In Odisha, a man was arrested for making a misleading post relating to COVID-19 on Facebook. At least 15 people, a majority of them being women, have been arrested for spreading fake news in Mizoram. Three people in Telangana were arrested for spreading fake news via social media for forwarding a fake picture on Whatsapp. In Maharashtra, at least 18 people were arrested for violating the advisory released by the State government which prohibits organizations or individuals from publicizing information about COVID-19 without ascertaining prior clearance from relevant government health authorities, in order to avoid spread of misinformation. The advisory has been framed by the State government under the Epidemic Diseases Act.  The problem with arrests for fake news is as follows:\n Wide ambit of Epidemic Diseases Act might lead to arbitrary arrests targeting specific community or political opponents. The Act could then be used to stifle political dissent instead of curbing fake news. Since these provisions are broadly phrased they can result in arbitrary action. For example, a news portal founder was arrested in Tamil Nadu for publishing reports that were critical of the government. It was claimed that the news reports were “false and provocative”. He was booked under S.3 of the Epidemic Act and S.188 and 505 (1) (b) of the IPC. Arrests for fake news have not proven to be effective in curbing fake news. This is because rampant arrests have been made of random people. For example, people who have forwarded a fake Whatsapp message have been arrested. This does nothing to either identify the source of the misinformation who has started the Whatsapp forward and in the age of social media it might be difficult to identify altogether. Additionally, it also does not curb the spread of the fake message itself since arresting people for forwarding messages, even though fake, only goes to show the inability of the government to control the spread of fake news and also poses the danger of possible human rights violations.  We write to the Home Ministry to issue an advisory\nWe draw our position against misinformation clearly. It is a complex problem which must be addressed by a policy tool kit that promotes the values of free expression and also to exercise any censorship powers based on the legal standards that emerge from a human rights framework. Here we have written to the Home Ministry and called on them to issue an advisory with a draft SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that draws from “Joint Declaration on ‘Fake News’, Disinformation and Propaganda” dated March 3, 2017.\nEffective communication should be made from official channels to fill the vacuum in which misinformation perpetuates. It is imperative for authorities to instead begin combating bad information with good information and curtail the room for speculation.Almost all countries around the world have seen their leaders holding regular press briefings to answer questions about the government response to the pandemic except India. With a 1.3 billion strong population locked down under some of the strictest lockdown measures, the panic and hysteria created due to fake news and misinformation in India has already been catastrophic and something which could have been easily avoidable if effective paths of communication had been created.\nArrests for fake news solve no purpose and should not be made\nArresting people for spreading fake news during this pandemic only further traumatizes individuals and communities in this unprecedented time. Instead of using the heavy handed approach of arrests, the government should try to ease the misery of the nation by providing clear and effective information.\nImportant Documents\n Representation to HMO on Social Media Arrests dated April 30, 2020.

S. 66A of the IT act has been struck down, by the Supreme Court, as unconstitutional in 2015. However, despite repeated directions by the SC, that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed and also that no fresh charges may be registered, the provision continues to be invoked across the country.\n#IndiaVSSection66A Last week, at least 16 complaints were made at various police stations all over India, against news anchor Arnab Goswami. The complaints were filed in respect of comments made on his news show, on 21st April 2020, for, amongst other things, “inciting communal hatred”. On the basis of these complaints, FIRs were filed under multiple provisions against Arnab Goswami in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. The complaints mention offences under Sections 117, 120B, 153, 153A, 153B, 295A, 298, 500, 504, 505, 506 etc of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000(IT Act) .\nS. 66A of the IT act, introduced by amendment in 2008, penalized sending \u0026ldquo;offensive messages\u0026rdquo; via online communication. The wide powers of the section were frequently used to stifle political dissent. For example, in May 2014, five students were temporarily detained in Bangalore for allegedly sharing a message on the mobile application “WhatsApp” that was critical of newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi. To combat this a case was filed before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000 was unconstitutional.\nIn March 2015, S.66A was declared unconstitutional by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union Of India as it violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The Court found that S. 66A was vague and could be arbitrarily interpreted to penalize even innocent speech. Significantly, the Court found that the provision was not ‘severable’ i.e., no part of the section could be saved and the provision as a whole was declared unconstitutional. This would have meant that the provision was void ab initio i.e was deemed to never have existed on the statute books. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A.\n#UnconstitutionalProsecutionsExposed In light of the provision being declared unconstitutional, the story should have ended there. However, a 2018 study, ‘Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies’, highlighted the continued use of S. 66A, including cases registered after the Shreya Singhal decision.\nTaking note of the above-mentioned study, People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties (‘PUCL’), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal Case approached the court in January, 2019 highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court\u0026rsquo;s decision. Prior to the hearing, in a counter-affidavit, the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on S. 66A. This included a letter the Government wrote on 11th January, 2019 and then a reminder on 14th January, 2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on S. 66A cases and also asking them to close them. Some states responded. For instance, Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after S. 66A was held to be unconstitutional and they would be closing all of them. The Court by judgement dated February 15, 2019, not only directed that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed but also that no fresh charges may be registered. The SC further directed that the Shreya Singhal judgement be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.\nInspite of the above, fresh claims were still instituted, as recently as last week, under the now unconstitutional provision. In January 2020, the Karnataka High Court imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 each on two police officers for registering an FIR under Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act. As recent as February 2020, a guest lecturer at a college in Assam, was charged under S.66A of the IT Act, arrested and later sent to judicial custody for posting derogatory remarks against the BJP, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ‘Sanatan dharma’. In March 2020, the Patna High Court granted bail to two petitioners accused of offences, amongst others, under S.66A of the IT Act. They had been in custody for 6 months. These instances highlight the continued invocation of S. 66A, 5 years after it was declared unconstitutional, despite further directions by the Supreme Court in 2019. This points to a systematic failure by the judiciary and law enforcement system.\n_#IFFBatsForDigitalRights_This is not about Arnab Goswami, but about the use of an unconstitutional provision of law. Even today people, ordinary smartphone users all across India are being prosecuted across the breadth of India. A casual search through the IndianKanoon database (like Pintoo Kumar) shows cases of FIRs being actively prosecuted as recently as March, 2020. This is more than 5 years after a Supreme Court judgement and is a stain on our criminal justice system.\nWe are committed to erasing Section 66A from every FIR and criminal case all across India, irrespective of the person who is being prosecuted. The journey of S. 66A highlights the importance and challenges of monitoring and ensuring compliance with the final decisions of the Supreme Court. To meet this challenge we have come up with a data driven, evidence based solution in partnership with CivicData Labs. We will be working in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system. S. 66A must die a complete constitutional death.\n(This post has been authored by Sonalakshi Naidu, a legal intern at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer, Anushka)\nImportant Documents\n Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies by Abhinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta (link) Section 66A bites ‘zombie’ dust.

We have called on BECIL to modify it\u0026rsquo;s tender to account for the grave breaches to the privacy, dignity and autonomy of health care professionals and members of the public that will be caused by these technologies being used and implemented by the Government.\nBackground We strongly support medical professionals who are the first responders to Covid-19. Protecting public health is a priority for all of us over at IFF. However, this cannot and should not be approached by breaches to privacy, dignity and autonomy of individuals, especially — medical professionals — in the absence of any clear basis in law.\nThis is why we have sent a legal notice to the Broadcasts Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL is a PSU under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting). Our notice dated April 26, 2020 is limited to items in the tendering process specifically the “Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” and the “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”. The procurement commenced for these technology tools while ostensibly intended to address health risks of Covid-19 cause certain injury to the constitutional rights of privacy, dignity and security rights of health care workers and those at risk of being infected by this virus.\n\u0026ldquo;Personnel Tracking GPS Solution\u0026rdquo; : Smartwatches or Digital Handcuffs? The first item sought to be procured is the “Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” for the ostensible health and safety of medical professionals and, “rescue teams”. The data collected through the, “cloud based software application” will be stored in a “data centre… in India”.\n  \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n  Specifically, there are three illegal features of this system as per the, “Solution Objective”, that will be implemented through a “wrist watch/I-card/App”.\n Deployment through physical wearable devices: There are repeated references to the use of this system through a, “wrist watch/I-card/App” which presumes that the deployment may be implemented through a personal wearable that is made compulsory. Restrictive, invasive monitoring of healthcare workers through features such as geo-fencing and live movement tracking: The product functionality of this personnel tracking system is extensive with the ability for administrators to create, “geofencing of zones” and “track workers of their location during working hours”. Use of facial recognition technologies intended to prevent, “impersonation control”: The “wrist watch/I-card/App” should have the ability to “manually take photograph of the person who is wearing the wrist watch/ I-Card/ App”, and “store all employees reference pictures which will be used regularly by a designated set of supervisory staff to compare with the photos shot by the workers during working hours”. Further functionality is indicated for, “AI Based face detection of Employee”.  “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool” : A digital leash on every Indian?\nAs per the Addendum No. 1 dated April 17, 2020 an additional item has been added for procurement under the title of a “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”.\n  This tool, is incredibly invasive as per the following functionality listed below:\n Leaps from healthcare surveillance to national security: The intended objective of the tool as listed in Item No. 1 of the specifications is to conduct, “Intelligence investigation platform \u0026amp; tactical tool to detect, prevent and investigate threats to national security”. Integration of multiple databases and personal data points: The “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool” is required to pull/collect information from multiple existing government databases and personal data points such as “telecom data and internet data”. Mass surveillance by design: The functionality of the “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool” is mass surveillance by its very design. The desired functionality includes, “to identify suspect Locations, Associations \u0026amp; Behaviour.” This includes, “Easily Geo- Fence an area of interest (eg Meeting place, airport, mosque, railway station, bus stand etc) and identify all the people present at the location at the time of event” and, Should be able to Identify a suspects behaviour, see what he or she does on specific days of the week, where does he or she order food from, where does the suspect go for regular walks, where does he/she work during the day, where does he/she sleep at night etc.”  Our legal notice and intention to take further action. Today, i.e. April 26, 2020 we sent a legal notice to BECIL clearly stating that the project offends the fundamental right to privacy, dignity and autonomy. We specifically reasoned how this project lacks any legality. In addition to this notice we intend to follow up this matter rigorously by seeking transparency in each step of this procurement and also if such situation does arise to examine steps to challenge it before an appropriate body.\nWe hope this situation does not arise and BECIL acting within the powers reserved under the tendering process modifies and removes the procurement of both the “Personnel Tracking GPS Solution” and the “Covid–19 Patient Tracking Tool”. This also makes just common sense given the availability of funds should be focused towards the immediate needs of healthcare professionals such as PPC (Personal Protection Coverall) Kits which are also a part of the present procurement.\nIncidentally, this is our second legal notice to BECIL with the first being on the now recalled Social Media Communication Hub. Subsequent to our notice the Ld. Mahua Moitra, Member of Parliment, Lok Sabha had filed a public interest litigation in the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court of India leading to it\u0026rsquo;s recall. We urge BECIL to be mindful of this undertaking to even in the present procurement as it involves common concerns of mass surveillance and impact on the privacy of medical professionals – as well as every Indian.\nImportant Documents  Link to IFF\u0026rsquo;s Legal Notice to BECIL dated 26.04.2020 (click here) Link to IFF’s work on the Social Media Communication Hub (click here) Twitter thread on the Supreme Court hearing dated August 3, 2018 on the Social Media Communication Hub (click here)  With mass surveillance becoming a reality we need greater resourses to fight back.

IFF has written to the DoT and TRAI suggesting that these interventions must look toward overcoming the digital divide, appreciating the importance of the internet and mobile services as an essential utility, and protect net neutrality. Towards this IFF recommends concerted stakeholder dialogue, evidence based interventions to support network capacity, efforts to use government funds towards providing free access to internet services to underprivileged/essential cohorts of people, ensuring all areas have access to high speed internet access and expediting the implementation of a net neutrality enforcement framework.\nBackground The lockdown has seen greater reliance of many segments of the populace on information and communications technologies, in particular the internet. People are using the medium for various purposes such as remotely working from home, distance learning, ordering essential items via e-retail, and telemedicine purposes. More generally, people also use it to stay in touch with their friends, family and loved ones, which is crucial to people’s mental health in these trying times.\nIn various guidances and notifications, telecommunication and internet services have been repeatedly classified by the Ministry of Home Affairs as essential items. In this regard, the importance of internet and telecommunications access has assumed considerable importance during the current public health crisis. It also brings with its own set of policy and regulatory challenges which must be addressed. If unaddressed, we believe there is a risk that the novel coronavirus may exaggerate the digital/technological divide; stress underlying network infrastructure and risk network neutrality.\nPrior Correspondence with the DoT and TRAI In a letter dated March 18, 2020 IFF previously wrote to the Hon’ble Minister of Communications and copied this to the DoT and TRAI. In it we anticipated that there may be a risk of undue pressure on underlying internet and mobile networks due to shifts and likely increases in network usage. Therefore we suggested authorities:\n Conduct periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure in consultation with telecom and internet service providers, content providers, startups and consumer facing organisations. Here, we stressed on the importance of preserving principles of net neutrality. Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies towards not terminating people’s connections, due to an inability to pay their bills. Urged the Central Government to issue an advisory that States and Union Territories should not issue internet suspension or restriction orders under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017.  So Why Are We Writing This Time? This is because there are new threats which are emerging, since the commencement of our over month long national lockdown.\n1. Threat to Net Neutrality In a letter dated March 21, 2020 the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wrote to TRAI requesting for clearance of charges for voice and data for certain websites and telephone numbers. Additionally, an Economic Times report suggested concessions to zero rate certain essential websites pertaining to government services, ecommerce and digital payments applications like the BHIM app, without being charged for data during the lockdown period.\nTo be sure, TRAI’s Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016, which ostensibly prohibits zero rating of data tariffs in India does allow for exemptions. However, we must consider such developments along with the fact that COAI has also written to online video content providers, to reduce their bitrates to alleviate stress on underlying network infrastructure. By referencing measures taken by online content providers in jurisdictions like Europe, we have noticed that most participants in the Indian market have complied and reduced their offerings to SD bitrates.\nThese measures have been taken by industry and have been taken with little evidence available to the public of the actual stress being placed on India’s underlying networks, owing to the national lockdown being excessive. India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as underutilised, and therefore even according to existing capacities should be able to handle a 20 percent surge in network traffic. This fact may be contrasted with reports which found that mobile internet use (India’s wireline subscriber base remains very less) only increased by 10 percent in the month of March 2020. Pertinently, in Tier 1 metros the increase was even more modest at 3-5 percent.\nThus, it may be concluded that without appropriate review and response mechanisms, there is a threat to India’s net neutrality regime. As such net neutrality in India remains imperfect owing to the fact that we are yet to finalise a definition of what falls under reasonable traffic management practices, and actual means of monitoring and enforcement. This lacuna in the framework has meant internet access providers in India can avoid compliance net neutrality obligations, under licensing conditions, with relative impunity. We have previously written to the government about these concerns in March and May, 2019 respectively.\n2. Risk of the Digital and Technological Divide It is reasonable to conclude that the pandemic is sure to hit those working in informal sectors and marginalised communities at large the hardest.\nA recent report on The Print and an article by Mr Osama Manzar (Digital Empowerment Foundation, Founding Director) are instructive in this regard. The Print article discusses how the coronavirus is shifting students to distant learning situations reliant on online/IVR based classes/educational setups. This means that in areas like Delhi, students from underprivileged backgrounds are at a distinct disadvantage owing to a lack of digital literacy, no availability of supporting equipment in the household like laptops and smartphones, chargers, and no access to high speed internet connections.\nSimilarly, Mr Manzar’s article also communicates that aside from internet access, many people from informal/marginalised backgrounds do not even have access to basic mobile connections as well. He illustrates this with the recent exodus from urban to rural areas after the announcement of the national lockdown. In it many people travelled in groups\u0026ndash; to the detriment of social distancing protocols. This is because the availability of phones with talk time to make calls, was often restricted to one or two persons in large groups. And in such times of hardship, the ability to make a timely phone call to a friend or family member can be a question of life and death.\nIFF’s Recommendations Keeping the above considerations in mind we urged the Ministry of Communications, DoT and TRAI to collectively consider the following interventions:\n Regular Review and Reports on Impact of COVID-19 on Internet Capacity: India should have twice a week meetings between DoT, TRAI, TSPs/ISPs, internet exchange points, CDN providers, cloud service providers, content providers, small businesses, video conferencing app developers, consumer groups and so on, to ascertain the actual impact COVID-19 is having on internet capacity and quality of service. The findings from these meetings along with support evidence should be published for the public at large. This will be analogous to the approach adopted by European authorities like BEREC. Consider Means to Expand Telecom Infrastructure Capacity: Although India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as under utilised, Indian authorities must be alive to the possibility that there may be a need to consider means through which it can ease network maintenance and deployment of internet access services. India must consider steps in this regard. For instance, it may consider discussions with TSPs to maintain an open dialogue on the need to expand network capacity, upgrading network equipment, capacity expansions of base stations in mobile networks, etc. It should also consider the need to free up access to particular airwaves to ensure networks are up and running in an interference free manner. Expedite Final Recommendations and Implementation of TRAI’s Net Neutrality Consultation: Considering advances being made by internet access providers which seek exceptions to the net neutrality frameworks, it becomes even more imperative that India expedites its finalisation of its definition for reasonable traffic management practices. At the same time there is a need for more robust monitoring, enforcement and institutions. Therefore, it becomes necessary for authorities to conclude its findings on the latest TRAI consultation on traffic management practices and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality. Consider Means for Free Wi-Fi Hotspots, Access to Laptops/Smartphones and 4G Router Availability: We have urged DoT and TRAI to consider commencing an initiative which deploys funds available under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). Along these lines, we also recommend they consider possibilities of working with the Ministry of Home Affairs and state governments to gauge availability of funds under the National Disaster Relief Fund and State Disaster Response Funds. These funds should be used toward facilitating public wi-fi hotspots, 4G routers, internet devices and so on, in particular targeting benefiting students from underprivileged backgrounds, informal workers, healthcare workers, first responders, and people from marginalised communities. Urge industry to not disconnect people’s internet/mobile services, and provide free data during lockdown period: Indian authorities and access service providers should identify vulnerable groups who would benefit from such targeted interventions, which help with the response but also help bridge the digital divide. We would also suggest TRAI and DoT work together with access providers in ensuring that people can have uninterrupted access to their internet and mobile services even if they fall behind on their payments or recharge schedules. Under utilised funds in USOF may be a useful tool in this regard as well. Urge States and UTs to Maintain Access Full Speed Mobile and Internet Connectivity During Lockdown: We urged central authorities to consider ways to limit government powers to issue directives which throttle the internet. Therefore, we recommended the issuance of an advisory which urges states to not issue any directions which suspend internet access or impose restrictions on accessing high speed internet.

IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.\nBackground on AFRS\nThe RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:\n Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs, Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA , Women and Child Development Ministry\u0026rsquo;s KhoyaPaya Portal, Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA Any other image database available with police/other entities.  The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject here). However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB. According to an update dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.\nAs pointed out in our previous blogpost on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.\nSteps taken by IFF\nIFF has sought a three year moratorium to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a legal notice to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.\nIn this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:\n NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  What’s Next?\nIFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.\nImportant Documents\n Representation to NCRB \u0026amp; MHA on AFRS dated April 21, 2020.

During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April.\nBackground Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing here.\nSubsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications.\nPractical Impact of the Internet Slowdown In addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP’s Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to collect these narratives.\n “I have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can’t understand what they are trying to tell me exactly\u0026hellip;One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask – is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It’s not possible to accurately pin-point what they’re saying.” -Doctor at Government Medical College on need for video facilities\n  “The universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them – oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students’ education won’t be affected?\u0026quot; - College Student\n The Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization’s Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all.\nWhat happened at today’s hearing? During today’s hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court.\nThe Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.\nThe Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report.\nIn addition to FMP’s petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed.\nAfter hearing submissions made by all counsels, the bench directed the Government to file a reply by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April.\nImportant Documents  Writ Petition filed by FMP (link)  We’re in this for the long haul.

In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.\nBackground | The Promise of Scale and Privacy Even as the Aarogya Setu application crosses the 50 million download mark, there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google announced a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.\nThe companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.\nThis development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.\nIn particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.\nProposed Timelines Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.\n In Phase 1 (to commence in May, 2020) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this. Phase 2 will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.  The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have announced that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.\nComing to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required. Similar to Singapore’s TraceTogether application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The inconsistency with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.\nShould an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.\nWhen it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.\nThe project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.\nRisks Arising from the Project One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.\nWhen private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.\nStringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.\n Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data: The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations. Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments. Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest: Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how App Store and Play Store treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions. Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments\u0026ndash; both economic and rights oriented. Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures: At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.  Relevance for India and What’s Next? It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.\nBased on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.\nLinks to IFF’s COVID-19 Related Work  Working paper \u0026ldquo;Privacy prescriptions for technology interventions around Covid-19 in India\u0026rdquo; dated April 13, 2020 (Google Docs version / PDF Version) Link to IFF’s first explainer blog post summarising the working paper’s analysis of India’s Aarogya Setu app (link) Representation to the Department for Telecom on ensuring connectivity and protecting net neutrality due to higher dependency on telecom networks (link) Representation to the Ministry of Health to issue an advisory against the disclosure of the names of persons placed under quarantine (link) Petition before the Supreme Court to restore 4G connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir to properly equip healthcare professional around Covid-19 (link)  The Corona virus is not only a threat to our health.

Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF’s Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.\nBackground\nOn April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called, “Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India”. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called Aarogya Setu.\nIFF’s working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government’s Trace Together application, MIT’s Private Kit: Safe Paths initiative, and Aarogya Setu.\nWhat is Contact Tracing?\nAccording to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.\nContact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).\nAs a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user’s device comes in contact with another user’s device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.\nWhat’s the Risk?\nWith the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief, most apps which are purported as ‘contact tracing’ technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.\nA lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between “snake oil” and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.\nSuch systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.\nIt may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.\nHow to prevent these risks?\nSuch systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:\n The usage of these applications should be voluntary All data should always be stored locally on people’s devices This data must be encrypted No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is “voluntary” and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  Therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:\n Strict limits (in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way  Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT\n  \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\n  Consider the following aspects.\nIs this for disease control or for other purposes?\nIn other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.\nIn India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of Aarogya Setu or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.\nTo protect people’s right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. Aarogya Setu retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on.\nMinimisation? What Minimisation?\n Singapore monitors people’s interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and then there’s India which uses both. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India’s Aarogya Setu collects multiple data points for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.      No Transparency leads to discretion\nThe only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does Aarogya Setu go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.\nSimilarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app’s Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.\nNo Accountability and No Auditability\nThe Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government’s processes are compliant with the right to privacy.\nSecond, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people’s personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.\nRisk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit\nFinally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the Aarogya Setu project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.\nFinally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people’s informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.\nConclusion\nIFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people’s informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.\nLinks to IFF’s COVID-19 Related Work\n Working paper \u0026ldquo;Privacy prescriptions for technology interventions around Covid-19 in India\u0026rdquo; dated April 13, 2020 (Google Docs version / PDF Version) Representation to the Department for Telecom on ensuring connectivity and protecting net neutrality due to higher dependency on telecom networks (link) Representation to the Ministry of Health to issue an advisory against the disclosure of the names of persons placed under quarantine (link) Petition before the Supreme Court to restore 4G connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir to properly equip healthcare professional around Covid-19 (link)  The Corona virus is not only a threat to our health.

We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India. This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.\nWe devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing. To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court’s developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It\u0026rsquo;s possible if we try!\nRe-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.\nHowever, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.\nRecognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.\nOverview of the working paper This working paper is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.\nFollowing this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person’s autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore’s TraceTogether, MIT’s Private Kit : Safe Path’s Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.\nFinally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, “.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things \u0026ndash; possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.”\nWe have three primary objectives from this working paper A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions: Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.\nBreaking the digital rights and technology development silos: **** Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.\nCollaborative solutions for government: We don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on Google Docs with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the Internet Freedom Forum.\nWhat does IFF plan to do with this working paper? We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.\nThis working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.\nLinks to our Covid related work  Working paper \u0026ldquo;Privacy prescriptions for technology interventions around Covid-19 in India\u0026rdquo; dated April 13, 2020 (Google Docs version / PDF Version) Representation to the Department for Telecom on ensuring connectivity and protecting net neutrality due to higher dependency on telecom networks (link) Representation to the Ministry of Health to issue an advisory against the disclosure of the names of persons placed under quarantine (link) Petition before the Supreme Court to restore 4G connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir to properly equip healthcare professional around Covid-19 (link)  The Corona virus is a not only a threat to our health.

This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner. What happened?\nLast year on May 14, 2019, an article published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a report containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.\nWhat is the law related to hacking?\nSurveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J_ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India_ which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.\nAdditionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group\nWe are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”\nIt was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.\nOur recommendations\n We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week.\nBackground Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India.\nDespite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns. The most recent of these orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 was issued on 03 April 2020 and it is due to expire on 15 April 2020.\n2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.\n  Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient.\n  In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.\nThe government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.\nHearing before Supreme Court During today\u0026rsquo;s hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir on 05 August 2019.\nSenior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition.

We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment.\nBackground On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India. This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework. The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.\nThe government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.\nRecommendations for Department of Telecommunications We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.\nNoting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.\nRecommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation.\nWe recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.\nImportant Documents  Representation dated 06.02.2020 sent to MoC and MeitY (link) Representation dated 03.04.2020 sent to MoP and ML\u0026amp;J (link)  We’re in this for the long haul.

Many of these lists have been circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, primarily those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. The circulation of this information is a breach of personal privacy and is exposing such quarantines to second order harms. To address it we have urged the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Urban Development and Housing; and the National Real Estate Development Council (NARDECO) to urgently issue advisories. Time to stop, spy the neighbour!\nIt is day 6 of a national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Repeated calls are being made public officials to maintain social solidarity and offer support. This spirit of social cooperation is jarring to the indiscriminate sharing of lists of persons who are suffering from Covid-19 infection; or, are suspected of being carriers; or, fall within a risk category due to recent travel. These lists of persons are being principally shared through digital means. This increases the field of dissemination of personally identifiable information and can lead to acute harm.\nSeveral press reports have emerged that such lists are being circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, principally those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. Further compounding this problem is that many of these lists seem to have been compiled by departments in State Governments and published on websites or, \u0026ldquo;leaked\u0026rdquo;.\nThese lists are not uniform and while may not contain the name of the person do contain personally identifiable information such as the addresses and the relatives of such persons. It is enabling discrimination, denial of essential health care and food items and even leading to instances where persons placed under quarantine are being placed under pressure of eviction by landlords and apartment societies.\n  \u0026ldquo;Screengrab from the website of the Karnataka State Government Portal\u0026rdquo;\n  \u0026ldquo;Vaishnav Jan To Tene Kahiye\u0026rdquo;\nSpurred by increasing press reports we have taken action by writing representations to the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Urban Housing; and the National Real Estate Development Council to issue urgent advisories against the sharing of such lists. We placed reliance on specific provisions of law including the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s 9 judge bench privacy judgement, provisions of Indian Medical Council Regulations and the Information Technology Act. Here much of our thought has been shaped by the leadership of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan that has written a representation on March 23, 2020.\nBeyond a breach of law, is a poor public policy choice at the time of a pandemic. Sharing of information weakens social solidarity that is needed to counter this shared and unprecedented social challenge. It is literally turning neighbour against neighbour.\nWe believe that state responses can be crafted while protecting the fundamental right to privacy as guaranteed under the Constitution. In our constitutional framework, one of the core values to advance the aims of social justice is of, fraternity. This value in ambedkarite thought has been explained by Shiveshwar Kundu as, \u0026ldquo;[c]entral to this idea of fraternity is the notion of friendship.\u0026rdquo; By releasing such lists containing personally identifiable information, this notion of social collegiality is replaced by private vigilantism. It undermines the founding ethos of our republic is beautifuly contained in Narsi Mehta’s poem _Vaishnav Jan To Tene Kahiye _ that was often sung as a hym by Gandhi jee as a call for practiced empathy.\nContinued actions on protecting digital rights in times of Covid-19\nIFF intends to do more. As next steps we commit to writing directly to the Chief Ministers and the Health Departments of specific state governments. Through the week we will also be articulating a nuanced position on contact tracing as being offered by several smartphone applications and its impact on personal privacy.\nWe are attempting our best to safegaurd your digital liberties as emergency measures are implemented due to Covid-19. These include support for internet access without compromising net neutrality; preventing internet shutdowns that can compound health risks; and continuing our work against illegal surveillance drones which are likely to be used in heavy handed ways against people who are scrabling to arrange essential commodities and rations for daily living.\nIf you think we can do more, or focus on any specific concern related to digital rights, as always please do reach out to us.

The Delhi Police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections and during the riots in North-East Delhi. This is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.Wait…. What?\nThe Delhi Police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. The first reports emerged in December, 2019 when it was reported that anti-CAA protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. This was in addition to the Delhi Police’s use of facial recognition technology to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the Delhi Police to cease such use here).\nSubsequently, there were reports that the Delhi Police used drones on crowds during the Republic Day parade in January, 2020 to “maintain vigil”. In February, 2020 there were reports that the Delhi Police had used drones to “monitor the situation” during the riots in North-East Delhi.\nNow reports are emerging that the Delhi Police is using drones to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the Government in a bid to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\nThe Delhi Police confirms using drones\nOn February 14, 2020, we filed a Right to Information request with the Delhi Police asking the following questions:\n  Whether the Delhi Police has procured drones for any purpose?\n  Details of the tender issued for such procurement.\n  Information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.\n  Information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.\n  Whether these drones were deployed in December, 2019 and January, 2020?\n  Any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the Delhi Police.\n  Our request was transferred to various departments of the Delhi Police. We received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. However, in a reply dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones.\nHere is a point-wise summary of their reply:\n  The North-East District has hired drones for maintaining law and order.\n  Since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.\n  The Delhi Police has been hiring drones from the open market through Station House Officers (SHO).\n  The technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the PIO.\n  The PIO confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election which were held on February 8, 2020 and during the riots in North-East Delhi which began on February 23, 2020.\n  In response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the Delhi Police, the reply was “no comment”.\n    Why does this matter anyway?\nThere are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in Delhi.\n  Hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. As a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.\n  Since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. There is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed.\n  So what now?\nIFF has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a legal vacuum. The only regulations for drones in India are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Drones are being used in Delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. It is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. We urge the Delhi Police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urge the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. This is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.\n(This post has been authored by Anushka Jain, a legal fellow at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer Sidharth)\nImportant Documents\n Right to Information Request filed by IFF questioning the use of drones by the Delhi Police (link) Reply received from the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police (link)  Let’s keep our skies clear and clean of illegal surveillance drones.

The region is already struggling to recover from the six month long shutdown imposed on 5 August 2019 and several of its key healthcare indicators are below the national average. Therefore, immediate restoration of 4G internet services in the region is necessary to prevent spread of the virus through telemedicine and effective public outreach.\nFree and Open Internet for All   \u0026ldquo;(Screenshot of ToI\u0026rsquo;s tweet before it was deleted)\u0026rdquo;\n  Yesterday, the Times of India tweeted that 4G internet services had been restored in Jammu and Kashmir but it subsequently deleted the tweet and published another article about this information being false. This led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\nWhile the rest of India transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest COVID 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2G speed in Jammu and Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir already has 7 confirmed COVID 19 cases. With these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the Government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives.\nDashboards and Chatbots for All While responding to the COVID 19 crisis, the Indian Government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. Take for instance, the Ministry of Health’s COVID 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. The Ministry of Health and MyGovIndia have also collaborated with WhatsApp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. Even private players like Apollo Hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing COVID 19 through a mobile app. However, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the Government is slowing down their internet speed to 2G which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.\nTelemedicine for All The difficulty in communicating through video on a 2G internet connection also means that doctors in Jammu and Kashmir cannot use telemedicine. During pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. Reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. However, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2G internet services.\nHealthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. The essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the Ministry of Home Affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. Therefore, depriving the people of Jammu and Kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the Government must immediately restore 4G services to reduce suffering and loss of life.\nImportant Documents  Representation dated 26.03.2020 sent to J\u0026amp;K Home Department and Ministry of Home Affairs (link)  IFF will continue its advocacy against internet shutdowns through thick and thin.

This not only means the ability to connect but also the political freedom ensured towards such access. Here, 5 years ago a division bench of the Supreme Court composed of Justices Chalameshwar and Nariman laid down an important foundation for internet freedom that is today under threat.\nThis victory was made possible due to the work and close collaboration of multiple litigants, lawyers and digital rights organisations (link). We mark this day to credit not only this victory but also to indicate urgency why this victory may not hold without a well resourced defence of its core principles.\nThe Shreya Singhal judgement as a significant step for Internet Freedom\nThis was through the Shreya Singhal Verdict that struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which was used to send political dissenters to jail across the political spectrum (link to summary). But much beyond it, the judgement also provided relief and greater clarity on the issue of takedowns by online service providers like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram etc. These platforms which are intermediary provide services that are utilised by millions today for exchanging information and bringing comfort to each other. However, they are also abused by content that is false and misleading or to make violent threats or hate speech.\nStriking a fine balance the Supreme Court held that such platforms as per the provisions under the law cannot be made liable for the acts of the users who post such illegal content. Given the volume of content they cannot be legally required to pre-filter, screen or exercise editorial control. Here, legal liability on them arises only when they fail to act for a specific takedown notice that states that such content is illegal and is sent under a valid court order or an executive authority. This check and balance ensures that there will be an opportunity for natural justice and it will prevent what many lawyers explain as a “chilling effect”. The third element of the Shreya Singhal judgement was on website blocking where disappointingly the court did not extensively engage with the arguments made by the petitioners (read more here).\nContinued threats to Internet Freedom\nAs many people shift to work from home, they wonder in the middle of a pandemic about safety, core provisions and financial stability. Many harmful impacts are being mitigated by the close to 600 million internet connections that are active in India that are helping bridge gaps of information and services. At the same time, even prior to Covid-19 the Shreya Singhal judgement and by it’s very basis has been eroded by regular attacks which have been documented and defended by us.\nFor instance our work has demonstrated that despite Section 66A being termed as unconstitutional it has continued to be applied (link) and there even have been serious proposals to reintroduce it (link). Takedowns by online intermediaries have become worse over time and there are proposed changes which would require increasing surveillance and censorship powers of the governments (link). At the same time online safety and disinformation are credible challenges. Website blocking orders continue to be made with little transparency and the ability to legally contest them (link).\nWe do not expect these challenges to be rolled back. Here it becomes necessary for our continued work to be well resourced to ensure you can continue enjoying the internet not only for work and, more importantly - play!\nSafeguard Internet Freedom today!\nTo mark the 5 year anniversary of the Shreya Singhal verdict, we have been grateful to receive support from LiveLaw, IndianKanoon and Broadband Forum who will host banner links and signal to their users to donate to IFF for a period of two weeks.

This is a response to recent statements by the Union Home Minister in the Indian Parliament of the use of such technologies in the investigations on the Delhi riots. IFF’s position on this front is informed by our own institutional work of mapping the deployment of facial recognition systems in India. In the letter, we also propose that the government impose a three year moratorium on this technology. In addition we propose the Government undertake a public consultation with various stakeholders in order to ensure that future uses of such nascent technologies remain fair, transparent and accountable.\nThe Problem with Facial Recognition Technology\nAs outlined in our previous posts, use of facial recognition technology in India is on the rise. The Central Government and different State Governments have already started deploying facial recognition technology for two major purposes: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity. At the level of the central government itself, multiple ministries are undertaking projects which rely on facial recognition systems. Moreover, they have allocated large amounts of public funds. These ministries include:\n The Ministry of Railways The Ministry of Civil Aviation The Ministry of Home Affairs  As we have suggested in our blogpost, use of this technology in a legal vacuum will lead to unprecedented and irreparable harms to the right to privacy. Here, we take the liberty to draw your attention to the Hon’ble Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India which says that certain standards have to be met in order to justify intrusion by the State into the right to privacy. These standards are legality (existence of a law), legitimate goal/state aim, proportionality between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them, and procedural guarantees to check against the abuse of State interference. Laws with regard to FRT and personal data protection which can act as a legal safeguard do not currently exist in India.\nThe implementation of facial recognition technology would also violate fundamental rights by facilitating mass surveillance. For instance, there will be a chilling effect on the right to freedom of speech and expression because people will be wary of being prosecuted in case they express anti-government sentiments. Further, the right to freedom of movement would be hampered as mass surveillance would allow the government to track the movements of individuals in real time across the country.\nImplementation of facial recognition technology in India has the potential of turning the country into a surveillance state. The problems that arise would not only affect the fundamental rights and civil liberties of individuals but also create mistrust towards any positive initiatives that the Government might undertake if no legal safeguards and best practices are put in place.\nRecommendations made in our letter\nTaking into consideration how other countries have approached this technology and based on India’s experience with Aadhaar, it would be advisable to hit pause and contemplate the serious challenges that come with such an invasive technology. Retrospectively regulating an already introduced measure would be an extremely difficult task and would mean setting ourselves up for failure. Taking the lead in flagging this issue, we propose a moratorium of three years on the ongoing FRT projects in India.\nTherefore, we are making the following recommendations:\n Impose a three year moratorium on facial recognition technology for government projects. Pass a strong data protection law with adequate checks and balances on state usage of facial recognition systems by both government and non-government actors. Commence a public and transparent consultation where government, industry, civil society, human rights groups, academia and similar stakeholders have a proactive dialogue which can articulate a policy-making/legislative pathway on the issue. The conversation must be nuanced enough to differentiate between different uses of the technology which can span governance, monitoring, law enforcement, commercial, R\u0026amp;D, academia, healthcare, and many more unforeseeable domains.  Under Project Panoptic, IFF will continue to keep tabs of these developments and work towards holding the Government accountable when they use such experimental technologies, which are so intrusive.\nImportant Documents\n IFF’s representation requesting a moratorium on facial recognition technology (link)**** Introduction to Facial Recognition Projects in India (link)**** Problems with Facial Recognition Technology Operating in a Legal Vacuum (link)**** Lessons from the International Debate on Facial Recognition (link)****  (This post has been authored by Anushka Jain, a legal fellow at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer Sidharth)\nEven masks will not save you from facial recognition technology!

We suggest ways in which the Government could strengthen and streamline its institutions within India’s competition framework. More importantly we stress on the need for India’s competition laws to be modernised to reflect challenges emerging from market concentration in technology markets. We look at it through the prism of innovation, consumer welfare and human rights dimensions. We also flag our concerns with certain insertions in the draft amendment. Additionally, we suggest certain additions/changes to help adapt the role of competition frameworks to modern digital markets.\nBackground to the proposed amendment Owing to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, many people across India are adjusting to their new reality of work from home and learn from home environments. In such times, important professional, education and personal connections are being facilitated by the internet. In particular a lot of us will notice that most of our integral interactions are being facilitated by platforms typically provided by a few firms. One may even say that these platforms and services which are required for communication, collaboration, information gathering and so on are becoming essential in these times. However, ask yourselves this. When these potentially essential services are basically controlled by a few firms what are the risks which arise as a consequence? Well, our response last week to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) attempts to articulate these concerns and submits proposals in a recently concluded consultation of India’s competition laws.\nFor context, on February 20, 2020 the MCA released a call for public comments on a proposed amendment to India’s Competition Act, 2002. In its current form the proposed amendment is called the draft Competition (Amendment) Bill, 2020. This amendment was an outcome to an earlier process where the Government had formed a Competition Law Review Committee (“CLRC”). This Committee submitted its final recommendations and accompanying report in August last year. In short the Committee made 50 recommendations and has a dedicated chapter on how competition laws must be updated for the digital economy.\nSo what does the proposed amendment attempt to do? To its credit, the proposed amendment accepts 45 of the CLRC’s recommendations. Relevant for the digital economy, it tries to broaden definitions for what constitutes a “cartel”. In addition the amendment attempts to broaden India’s nodal competition authority i.e. the Competition Commission of India’s (“CCI’s”) ability to scrutinise anti-competitive agreements/arrangements. This is important since digital economies are multi-sided markets which are prone to rapid “network effects”. In essence it is also prone to challenges like user lock in, or stickiness. Such considerations also serve as a barrier for other players to compete since service providers must necessarily also acquire a degree of scale to survive. In this context, there are many instances of service delivery chains being integrated through strategic partnerships by large technology platforms in a manner where businesses end up being excluded and struggle to compete. To this end, we laud the amendment’s attempt to broaden the CCI’s ability to look into anti-competitive agreements.\nSimilarly, we applaud the amendment’s attempt in expanding the CCI’s ability to scrutinise mergers and acquisitions (collectively referred to as combinations) in technology markets. This is important since large mergers and acquisitions which often slip under the radar in technology markets\u0026ndash; and can lead to silent concentration in markets unbeknownst to users and even the regulator. Some clear examples of this include Microsoft’s acquisitions of Skype and LinkedIn; Facebook’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram; or Google’s acquisitions of health companies like FitBit. The reason this happens is because in digital markets it is difficult to gauge assets and the nature of the concentration really taking place in the market. To this end, we applaud the proposed amendment which seems like an enabling provision to scrutinise mergers of an ilk similar to the ones mentioned above.\nWell if the amendment sounds so good then what’s missing or wrong? And what have we said?  Institutional Design: In this context, the amendment proposes institutional changes which may compromise the independence of the CCI, thereby compromising an essential facet of strong competition laws. We propose a change which can achieve the desired objective of accountability whilst preserving the desired goal of CCI’s independence vis-a-vis Government functionaries. We have also suggested that in modern technology markets there will be greater need for the CCI to coordinate with other sector specific regulators in domains like telecom, digital payments and user privacy. We propose a framework through which such interactions are formalised and can be as streamlined as possible. We have also suggested measures to improve capacity within the CCI and its appellate structures, in terms of number of benches (to help with overburdening of cases), and greater specialisation which will be required when it comes to competition matters in technology markets. Issue with Carve out for Intellectual Property Holders to Abuse of Dominance Investigation: Abuse of dominance is a type of anti-competitive practices where an entity uses its power within the market, to either suppress competition, hinder innovation, distort consumer choice and so on. Relying on the works of field experts we have articulated that such a carve out for IP holders in matters of abuse of dominance does not exist in other advanced jurisdictions like Europe. Second, an exception for IP holders would be able to use this as a defence tactic which can slow down or serve as an obstacle to legitimate investigations in abuse of dominance cases. The same research also indicates that such a provision may also make it harder to hold players who provide essential facilities accountable. As we have seen in the context of COVID-19 there are certain players in information/tech markets which provide services which may be construed as essential facilities. Holding Big Tech and Big Data Analysis Accountable: Our response relies considerably on the works of international organisations like Privacy International. We unpack how our personal data is often used as a proxy for price. And therefore, there is an inextricable linkage with our informational privacy. We discuss how our rights may be harmed by opaque integration of upstream and downstream chains through which the service is put together and ultimately delivered to consumers. Similarly, major mergers and acquisitions are also linked with individual rights including the right to privacy. What it also leads to is a greater concentration of our personal data across a few entities. India\u0026rsquo;s Competition Laws Lack Maturing for Tech Markets: For instance, Indian competition frameworks do not adequately look at what constitutes holding a dominant position in internet markets. In addition, our competition laws (as articulated by the CCI in matters like Vinod Kumar Gupta v WhatsApp Inc) do not view it as an essential to consider privacy when hearing competition related matters. We suggest mechanisms through which individual rights should also be considered in our competition frameworks. Need for Rights Related Impact Assessment Mechanism: One suggestion we make pertains to instances of combinations; or key business decisions which consider integration of different databases/backend infrastructure. We believe the CCI should be able to have the ability to work with relevant authorities like India’s future data protection authority to undertake human rights or privacy impact assessment as a result of a suggested measure. Along the same lines we also suggest that the CCI must modernise its approaches in measuring what constitutes enjoying a dominant position in a particular market.  We hope the Ministry keeps our submissions in mind during subsequent deliberations. The hope is that a subsequent draft can have a more detailed consultation wherein stakeholders are afforded greater time and adequate space to share substantive feedback with the Ministry.\nImportant Documents  Link to IFF’s Submission on the draft Competition Amendment Bill, 2020 (click here) Link to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ draft Competition Amendment Bill, 2020 (click here) Link to the Competition Law Review Committee\u0026rsquo;s report which was published in August 2019 (click here) Link to the Competition Act, 2002 (click here) Link to a SpicyIP post by Dr Vikas Kathuria which explains challenges with exceptions for IP holders against abuse of dominance investigations (click here) Link to an explainer by Privacy International on the relationship between competition laws and people’s privacy (click here)  Uncle Ben taught us well!

With most experts unanimous on the need for social distancing and many workplaces putting into place work from home plans, voice and data connectivity become critical. To ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of India we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the Department of Telecom.\n\u0026ldquo;We the people\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, of the Internet Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union Government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all Indians as per an advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare titled, “Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease” (link). Point number 3 to this advisory recommends to, “Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.” A “work from home” measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals, companies and the entire Indian economy.\nAt the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support. Even for children, remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed. Many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of Covid-19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services. However, as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to.\nA recent report in the New York Times, dated March 16, 2020 informs us that a work and learn from home set up, leads to considerable stress on underlying network infrastructure (link). This is because last mile home service networks are designed to handle traffic patterns which are considerably different to enterprise grade internet broadband networks. Moreover, Wi-Fi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service.\nWe need to have a plan to support each other We urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries. We specifically suggest the following:\n Periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure constraints**:****** There is an urgent need for the DOT and TRAI to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic. Separately, there\u0026rsquo;s a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online. All of these actions must nonetheless, uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic. Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies: We recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the Union Government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by COVID-19. Ensure full and complete access at all times: We urge that an advisory may be issued to all State Governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations. This includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activities.  We urge people from across the community (especially technical experts and small businesses) on if they have experienced any difficulties whilst accessing the internet, or using voice and video conferencing services. IFF will remain alert to the situation should it develop.\nImportant Documents  Link to IFF’s representation to the Minister of Communications, Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad which has been copied to both the DoT and TRAI (click here) Link to New York Times article dated March 16, 2020 which articulates some of the network connectivity issues faced in the US (click here)  We\u0026rsquo;ve got your back folks!

We have received multiple replies from both authorities detailing their use of the technology. In this blogpost, we summarize those replies and highlight problems which arise as a result. Such projects are emblematic of the need for a three year moratorium on the use of FRT in India during which comprehensive public consultation should be undertaken.\n#ProjectPanoptic #facialrecognition\nBackground\nOn 18.1.2020, TSEC released a circular which stated that they would run a pilot project during the urban body elections in Kompally. In this project, 10 pollings stations will use facial recognition technology to verify/authenticate the identity of voters in a bid to counter voter impersonation. According to the circular, this technology was developed and supplied t by TSTS. Alerted about possible constitutional risks, IFF filed multiple RTIs on January 24, 2020 and February 05, 2020, respectively. Both RTIs were filed with the state election commission and TSTS to learn more about the specifics of the project, the legal basis for the project, details on expenditure by the state, and safeguards to protect people’s constitutional rights if any.\nQuestions asked\nOn 24.1.2020 our RTI request sought details on the following facets:\n The legislation under which the authorities are using facial recognition technology; Whether there was a standard operating procedure for the pilot project; Details regarding the results of the pilot projects by TSTS including error rate and bugs reported; and The total expenditure by the state on the pilot project.  On 5.2.2020, IFF filed additional RTI requests with TSEC and TSTS in which we asked for the project report and questioned the accuracy of the technology. We also asked whether any future use of the technology was planned.\nReplies received\nWe have received multiple replies from both these authorities.\n In a reply dated 18.2.2020, TSEC states that it is authorised by Article 243-ZA of the Constitution of India to use FRT. Article 243 ZA of the Constitution states that the State Election Commission is in charge of all matters related to the conduct of elections to Municipalities. This, however, is not a sufficient basis for FRT use for voter verification. Such FRT projects are being implemented in India in a legal vacuum. This violates the decision in Puttaswamy vs UOI which states that certain standards have to be met in order to justify intrusion by the State into the right to privacy. These standards are  a) legality (existence of a law)\nb) legitimate goal/state aim\nc) proportionality between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them, and\nd) procedural guarantees to check against the abuse of State interference.\n They also sent a copy of the letter which details the Standard Operating Procedure of the project. According to the SOP, TSTS sent its officials to the selected polling stations in Kompally to assist in implementing the pilot project. Identification and authentication was carried out through a mobile app which contained the technology. TSTS ensured that all data will be deleted once the statistics are collected for the pooling process and will not be used for any other purpose.\n  The total expenditure incurred was Rs. 10,200 per polling station. The pilot project was carried out in 10 polling stations. Thus, the total expenditure is Rs. 1,02,000, i.e., one lakh and two thousand rupees.\n  In a reply dated 27.02.2020, the TSEC says that no decision has been taken about the future use of FRT. Also included was a letter from TSTS dated 4.2.2020 which provides the result of the project including the accuracy rates of the FRT. The average accuracy rate was 78%. A 78% accuracy rate is not satisfactory. This is because exclusion as a result of non-verification would lead to a loss of rights. In this case, the right to vote.\n  It was also stated in the letter that low results in some polling stations were due to bad lighting and network issues. It was also stated that all the data including the photos were deleted from the servers.\n  In a reply dated 11.3.2020, the TSTS provided information about their previous use of FRT for authentication of pensioners. The accuracy rate was 94% and no bugs were reported.\n  IFF’s recommendation\nThe use of such experimental facial recognition systems in Telangana is illegal. It is further proof that without strong privacy protections, such systems are likely lead to the erosion of people’s rights.

In its response to the petition, MeitY has cited provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, which prohibit giving and taking of dowry and ban individuals from publishing advertisements offering dowry, as the justification for blocking the Dowry Calculator website. MeitY has also alleged that it could not provide notice or hearing to the Petitioner prior to blocking his website because they couldn’t find his contact details even though the screenshot of the website attached by MeitY clearly displays his name and Twitter handle.\nConflating Satire with Abetment and Advertisement For those of you who may be unaware, Dowry Calculator is a satirical website created by Tanul Thakur in 2011 which generates a fictional dowry amount for every individual based on age, height, skin colour, alma mater etc. The satirical intent of the website is quite evident from its content and design. For instance, when one tries to pick a skin colour, the options include ‘Pitch Black (Not visible on a Moonless night)’ and ‘Wheatish (Almost white. Would need some fair n Lovely).’ The website also states that it is “dedicated to all the match-making aunties of India.” The website was blocked in 2018 after social media outrage by prominent politicians like Jyotiraditya Scindia. Read more about the controversy here.\nIn its reply to Tanul Thakur\u0026rsquo;s petition challenging the blocking of his website, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has failed to engage with the Petitioner’s arguments about his website’s satirical nature. Instead, MeitY has relied on Sections 3 and 4A of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 to justify blocking of the website. Under Section 3, MeitY has accused the Petitioner of abetting the offence of giving and taking of dowry. When faced with arguments about the right to satirise, MeitY has summarily dismissed any possibility of the website using humour to criticize a social evil merely because it does not contain an explicit disclaimer about being satire.\nAnother provision invoked by MeitY is Section 4A which prohibits any individual from publishing advertisements offering any money or property as consideration for the marriage of his son or daughter or any other relative. Section 4A is clearly inapplicable in the context of Dowry Calculator which parodies and mocks the patriarchal practice of dowry rather than glorifying it. In any case, Section 4A can be invoked only if an individual offers dowry for the marriage of his/her relative and this key ingredient is missing in the case of Dowry Calculator.\nError: User Not Found The constitutional validity of Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which empowers the Central Government to block websites was upheld by the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India because there is a mandatory obligation to provide notice and hearing to an individual prior to blocking his/her website. However, as Tanul Thakur’s case amply demonstrates, these procedural requirements are frequently flouted by the authorities. Lack of notice and hearing was one of the main contentions raised in the writ petition and you can read more about it here.\nIn its response, MeitY has alleged that it could not provide notice to the Petitioner because there were no contact details available on the website. This is contrary to the screenshots of the website which have been annexed by MeitY which clearly feature the name and Twitter handle of the Petitioner. Moreover, a simple WHOIS search also provides the email ID of the Petitioner. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that all reasonable efforts were made by MeitY officials to provide notice and hearing to the Petitioner.\nDefending Secrecy in Website Blocking The writ petition challenges the constitutionality of the confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules 2009 in so far as it applies to owners, creators, developers and curators of blocked content. This was necessary because MeitY had previously invoked Rule 16 to reject the Petitioner’s RTI application seeking a copy of the blocking order and complaint.\nMeitY has argued that Rule 16 is necessary to protect the identity of the person who reports any website for hosting illegal content, and disclosure of such information would violate the fundamental right to privacy and jeopardize the safety of whistleblowers. While personally identifiable information of whistleblowers deserves protection, this does not explain why complaints received from Nodal Officers of Government Ministries and Departments, recommendations of the Committee for Examination of Requests and orders issued by the Designated Authority cannot be disclosed. If these documents contain any personally identifiable details of a private individual, those details may be redacted but a copy of these documents must be shared with the person whose website has been blocked.\nThe next date of hearing in the case is 21 May 2020 and the Petitioner will file his rejoinder before then. IFF has been providing litigation and RTI assistance in this case since 2019 and we are grateful to Advocates Siddharth Agarwal, Vrinda Bhandari and Abhinav Sekhri for representing the Petitioner before the Delhi High Court.\nImportant Documents  Copy of Reply filed by MeitY (link)  Censoring the web should not be so easy for trigger happy government officials.

Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.\nBackground In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.\nWe have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.\nWe believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the IAMAI and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, Justice A.P. Shah. In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.\nSubsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner\u0026ndash; with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.\nLatest Developments In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB endorsed a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).\nAdditionally, a report in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.\nOur concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively banned an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nWhat have we written? Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by Access Now which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.\nIFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.\nImportant Documents  Link to IFF’s open letter to Justice AP Shah and copied to the Governing Council of the IAMAI dated March 12, 2020 (Click here) Link to blog providing synopsis of Access Now’s report on online content governance (Click here) Link to IFF’s open letter Justice AP Shah dated February 11, 2020 (click here) Link to IFF’s letter dated February 07, 2020 sent to IAMAI, with copies sent to the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry of Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (MeitY) (click here) Link to press report of Government’s counter affidavit in Supreme Court endorsing self-regulation institutional mechanisms for social media along the lines of legacy media (click here) Link to Mumbai Mirror story dated March 03, 2020 which reveals MIB’s meeting with online content players where 100 day timeline for self regulation framework is imposed (click here) Link to news report highlighting Hotstar ban of Last Week Tonight episode on PM Narendra Modi (click here) Link to text of IAMAI’s Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers (click here)  Want to watch John Oliver do his thing unimpeded?

The Committee has already identified the proliferation of inciteful messaging across social networking platforms as a leading cause for the coordinated violence administered across North East Delhi. As a result the Committee intends to probe online hate speech and misinformation which is shared by social media users online. After a process of validation the Committee will forward complaints to the police and relevant authorities for formal investigation/prosecution. However, the Committee’s reporting mechanism, the vague nature of the punishable activity and the degree of punishment lends itself to risks of over censorship and chilling effect. IFF has written a letter to the Committee’s chairperson along with copies to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and IT Minister Kailash Gahlot. In it we have expressed concerns of how arbitrary criminal proceedings with vaguely defined grounds are incompatible with constitutional thresholds of free speech and expression. We have suggested corrective measures and apprised the Committee of established standards of incitement as articulated at international fora.\nThe Committee for Peace and Harmony In response to the riots which took place in North-East Delhi last month, the Delhi Government has set up a Committee for Peace and Harmony which is being chaired by AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj. The Committee also includes Abdul Rehman, Ajay Kumar Mahawar, B.S. Joon, Dilip Pandey, Jarnail Singh, Kuldeep Kumar, Atishi Marlena and Raghav Chadha. It aims to address the role of misinformation and incitement to violence in the riots. The Committee also aims to stop any further incitement of communal tensions.\nThe Committee has publicised that the criminal punishment for spreading fake news or “hateful content” will be imprisonment of 3 years. What is troubling is that the exact provision or law under which such specific punishment is being articulated remains unknown. This is especially concerning since the punishment being discussed would be equally applicable to people who forward or amplify the information, as compared to the actual source of origin. This runs the risk of arbitrary enforcement and could see people being sent to jail for speech which is supposed to be constitutionally protected.\nIn addition the mechanism through which the Committee takes up incidents to investigate is questionable. Specifically, the Committee has asked the public to report any such messages and corresponding individuals to authorities via whatsApp or email. People who report incidents against which FIRs are filed will receive a reward of Rs. 10,000. Such incentive structures will see the public have a bias towards reporting individuals to authorities.\nWe are concerned that this may lead to people getting unfairly prosecuted against. Moreover, we are concerned about this leading to excessive censorship and may lead to a widespread chilling effect on people’s speech and expression. One positive safeguard the Committee contemplates is seeking the advice of legal, technological and fact checking experts before forwarding complaints to police and other relevant authorities. As on March 06, 2020 the Peace and Harmony Committee has already received more than 950 complaints of people spreading hateful content/fake news.\nIFF’s recommendations While the aim of the Committee is commendable, it also has to be ensured that any restrictions on speech fall within constitutional parameters of “reasonableness” and “proportionality.” Thus, in order to remedy the inherent risks associated with the Govt of NCT of Delhi’s Committee on Peace and Harmony IFF recommends that:\n FIRs are filed only when an offence is made out under Sections 153 A, 153 B, 295A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which are the relevant provisions under Indian criminal law addressing hate speech and incitement. The Committee carefully considers whether the complaints received by it satisfy constitutional standards relating to proximity and imminence of harm prior to recommending criminal action against individuals. Through safeguards it should ensure that constitutionally protected forms of speech such as advocacy and discussion (even if they are threatening, shocking or disturbing in nature but not amounting to incitement) are not trampled upon. People’s ability to engage in legitimate speech deserve protection even in these trying times. The Committee should follow thresholds of incitement articulated by international human rights forums. In this regard, the Rabat Plan of Action developed by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2013 suggests key factors that must be considered prior to imposing restrictions on speech:   Social and political context which existed at the time the speech was made. Speaker’s position and status in society. Content and form of the speech. Reach of the speech act including the size of its audience and mode of dissemination. Likelihood and imminence of harm.   The Committee must be careful that its investigations on the dissemination of false information is administered in a manner where the incidents are connected to actual incitement. The Committee must take cognizance of speeches made by political leaders in public gatherings immediately, prior to and during the riots which called for violence. This is important even from the perspective of thresholds like incitement since such actors have greater public influence and have very tangible capabilities in mobilising people towards specific action.  In order to help people’s constitutional guarantees like their right to freedom of speech and expression, IFF has informed the Committee that we are available to provide legal expertise, if required. Our expertise in online censorship can help the Committee distinguish between actual instances of incitement against other instances where a forward or retweet falls under constitutionally protected forms of speech.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s Letter to the Delhi Committee on Peace and Harmony.

The ISPs, namely ACT and BSNL, justified some of these instances as responses to directions issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Since this appears to be a breakdown of enforcement machinery to the detriment of the network neutrality, IFF has written to officials within the DoT and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to take up the matter and remedy the situation.\nWhat Happened? On March 04 and 05, 2020 IFF received or got wind of multiple complaints of websites being blocked by internet providers in both Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\nIn Bengaluru, BSNL was reportedly blocking the www.bbc.co.uk domain. According to a screenshot seen by IFF, access to the site was blocked based on direction from the DoT. Additionally, ACT was seen to be blocking user access to sites like thequint.com, eastmojo.com, and onlinebsm.com. We got another independent complaint that ACT was blocking access to blogs hosted on name.weebly.com.\nSimilarly, in Hyderabad we received a complaint which demonstrated that ACT was blocking access to an open source web developer site called Bootstrap with the domain name www.getbootstrap.com. The justification provided in this instance was that the site was blocked as per directions from the DoT.\nOur Analysis Any DoT website blocking order for any of these sites remains absent in the public domain. This we feel is not aligned with the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India’s judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India (dated January 10, 2020) which essentially tells Government that orders which block people’s access to the internet should be put out in the public domain. Moreover, some (if not all) of these sites are unlikely to have content which can be blocked as per established thresholds which are prescribed under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, 2000.\nAlternatively, we suspect that this is a common tactic of ISPs to invoke Government directions, which could be used as a front for arbitrary website blocking. If correct, the aforementioned instances are clear violations of net neutrality obligations under existing licensing requirements. The net neutrality principle has been incorporated into the scheme of internet and telecom licenses since July 2018. It mandates your internet provider to not indulge in discriminatory treatment of internet traffic. Discriminatory treatment has been clarified in the licenses to include practices like blocking, degrading, slowing down or granting preferential speeds/treatment to any content.\nWhat have we done? IFF has written letters to the DoT’s Telecom Enforcement Resource and Monitoring (TERM) Cells in Bengaluru and Hyderabad to take up the matter. We have also copied these letters to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) since they just completed a consultation which deliberates on issues relating to net neutrality enforcement.\nWhat’s next and how can you help? IFF will continue to keep monitoring the situation and take up the issues with authorities if required. For this, we need your help. We have relaunched the net neutrality violation reporting mechanism on the SaveTheInternet.in website.

On February 13 2020, IFF had already filed its main comments with TRAI on its ongoing consultation on net neutrality enforcement. However, we were troubled by the requests of large industry representatives and especially internet access providers. In essence their recommendations were geared towards acquiring discretion in terms of network management, imprecise monitoring, “light touch” enforcement and discriminatory institutional structures which would translate into limited accountability. IFF has filed counter comments to rebut these proposals and urge Indian authorities to develop strong mechanisms to realise its seminal net neutrality amendments.\nBackground We were premature in our celebrations folks.\nWhile Indian authorities incorporated net neutrality within legal and licensing systems, the actual implementation of the framework remains largely non-existent. To remedy this on January 02 2020, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India commenced a consultation on the scope of reasonable traffic management practices and a proposed multistakeholder body for net neutrality. The process is meant to define acceptable instances where your internet provider is allowed to block, slow down (throttle) or prioritise certain types of internet traffic. If not carefully crafted, it can lead to wide exceptions and inadvertently leave the net neutrality principle impotent. You can read an explainer drafted by IFF on the specifics of the consultation paper here.\nIFF responded to the consultation on February 13, 2020. You can read the complete version of our submission here. Alternatively, you can read this blog post where we have summarised the main issues addressed by our main comments. Put briefly, our recommendations advocate for:\n Limiting scope for discretion which prevents your internet provider from practicing class-based discimination between different types of traffic; Creating frameworks which are immediately implementable and avoiding a “wait and watch” approach which lets telecom providers off the hook; Creating holistic disclosure frameworks to hold internet providers accountable; TRAI to embrace technical and crowd-sourced monitoring tools to develop comprehensive assessment frameworks; and Ensuring that a multistakeholder body is transparent and inclusive by design to ensure it does not fall prey to industry capture\u0026ndash; especially telecom capture.  So what are we responding to? We noticed that large industry stakeholders, especially telecom representatives, like Airtel, Reliance Jio, Broadband India Forum and the Cellular Operators Association of India were largely following the same script.\nAmong other things they advocated for light touch frameworks; wide exceptions in terms of what is allowed as network management practices; authorities stay away from technical monitoring tools; and a complete rejection for any inclusive multistakeholder body. These stakeholders either advocated for no advisory body or at best one which is skewed in favour of telecom players. They also requested TRAI legitimise rights restricting content filtering tools and invasive techniques to snoop network traffic called deep packet inspections (DPIs). Their arguments ranged from efficient network management to higher quality of service for the end user.\nSome players like Airtel even made recommendations which went beyond the scope of this consultation. Specifically, they asked TRAI to consider applying neutrality requirements on players across the internet value chain like Netflix. One could assume that such recommendations are meant to serve as a means to distract the authority from the issue at hand. What was really disturbing is that the basis for most of their submissions were on two particularly unfortunate arguments:\n First, Airtel argued that the net neutrality principle ill-suited in the context of next-generation access technologies like 5G. In fact, they linked the government’s decision to implement the net neutrality principle with future investments in 5G. Second, Airtel argued that current legal systems work well enough since there have been no net neutrality violations in the ecosystem since the amendments. As we mention even in our counter-comments, this is disingenuous at best. IFF has previously written to telecom authorities with its findings on crowd-sourced complaints in which the public apprised us of alleged net neutrality violations. For further texture read these blog posts here and here. We have highlighted this in our counter-comments and discussed how the above representations by stakeholders like Airtel are inaccurate.  What have we said in our counter comments? Many stakeholders requested TRAI to align its eventual recommendations with the financial and/or economic health of the telecom sector. We have reminded TRAI that another key aspect of internet governance is ensuring the advance of people’s right to receive and impart information, the ability to exchange ideas, and overall diversity and plurality. Keeping this in mind we have, among other things, represented the following points:\n TRAI should narrow loopholes like the definition of reasonable traffic management practices and specialised services. This will prevent internet providers from abusing regulatory exceptions to discriminate against certain types of internet traffic to the detriment of internet users. Light touch regulations should be discarded. Strong enforcement is needed since telecom operators are acting in this sphere with impunity at this stage. TRAI should not fall for the 5G red herring and create wide exceptions in the favour of providers for a technology which is ways away from rollout. Monitoring and assessment should be done with the help of technical tools since it can help with objective benchmarking and investigations. TRAI must recommend an inclusive multistakeholder body which prevents industry capture, and helps raise institutional capacity within the state to catch and punish net neutrality violations.  IFF will continue to keep tabs on the situation and will follow up with relevant authorities to realise an equitable internet experience which was promised out of the original net neutrality movement.\nImportant Documents  Link to IFF’s counter comments to TRAI’s consultation on neutrality (click here) Link to IFF’s main submission to TRAI’s consultation on net neutrality (click here) Link to TRAI’s Consultation Paper on Traffic Management Practices and a Multi-Stakeholder Body dated 2nd January, 2020 (click here) Link to our 6 page summary of TRAI’s consultation paper (click here)  The Avengers had to team up to defeat Thanos.

These responses, when looked at in their entirety, raise several concerns. In this blogpost, we have summarized these responses and also listed the immediate concerns which should be addressed by the Chandigarh Police.\nBackground\nOn 20 January 2020, IFF filed an RTI with the Chandigarh Police seeking information about the use of CCTV cameras and Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) systems in the city of Chandigarh. The questions asked revolved around the legal basis for installation of CCTV cameras, details of tenders issued for procurement of CCTV cameras, security and storage of CCTV footage and sharing of CCTV footage with external agencies.\nWe received a total of 5 replies from the Chandigarh Police after our RTI was transferred across several departments. Three responses are of particular relevance which are enumerated below.\nResponse from Chandigarh Police (Traffic Department) | February 5, 2020\nIn the first substantial reply we received on 5 February 2020, the Chandigarh Police (Traffic Department) disclosed that they have installed a total of 100 CCTV cameras at 20 intersections/roundabouts across Chandigarh. These cameras are operated by the CCTV Control Room of the Chandigarh Traffic Police. They have also shared a list of the locations where these cameras had been installed.\nChandigarh Police (Technical Department) | February 18, 2020\nIn the second and third replies we received on 18 February, 2020 from the Chandigarh Police (Technical Department), the following information was disclosed:\n The maintenance of CCTV cameras is entrusted to the Technical Department of the Chandigarh Police itself. There are a total of 227 analog cameras which have been installed. This does not match the figure of 100 cameras provided by the Traffic Department. The cameras being used are of various brands including Bosch, Hikvision, Samsung and Adhua. When asked about the storage duration and capacity, the Chandigarh Police stated that how long CCTV footage is stored depends on the storage capacity of existing DVRs/Hard Disks provided with these systems. With regard to access to the data, the Chandigarh Police has disclosed that Senior Officers of the Chandigarh Police are authorized to obtain the CCTV footage of these systems “as and when required in various police investigations/enquiries/RTI matters etc.”  Lingering Concerns\nThe RTI responses received raise four major concerns. First, due to the discrepancy in numbers, we currently do not know how many cameras have been installed in the city of Chandigarh. It is unclear whether 100 cameras mentioned by the Traffic Department are in addition to or included within the 227 cameras mentioned by the Technical Department of Chandigarh Police. Second, there is blatant violation of the principle of storage minimization because the footage from CCTV cameras is retained for an indefinite period of time and it is not deleted after a stipulated period. This type of indefinite storage of outdated footage increases the risk of data breaches and misuse. Third, all Senior Officers of the Chandigarh Police are authorized to access the footage as and when required but there is no clear definition to determine which police officers qualify as “Senior Officials.” Finally, sharing footage with police officials for any police investigations/enquiries/RTI matters etc. is overbroad and it has left us wondering whether footage can be accessed by any individual who files a request for information under the RTI Act.\nThe operation of CCTV cameras must be governed by a proper legislative framework and stringent operating procedures to prevent disproportionate encroachment on citizens’ privacy. The Chandigarh Police must reconsider their approach to video surveillance and take necessary measures to ensure that CCTV cameras function in a fair, transparent and accountable manner.\n(This blogpost has been authored by Anushka Jain, a legal fellow at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffers, Devdutta and Sidharth)\nImportant Documents\n RTI filed by IFF dated 20 January, 2020.

The brief highlights how the National Population Register violates data protection principles of lawfulness, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization and accountability. Based on this case study, the brief identifies various loopholes in the Bill and recommends necessary changes.\nThe Database Republic   The National Population Register has been in the headlines during the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act but the project has a long and interesting history. Originally proposed in 2001 in the aftermath of the Kargil War to address concerns of cross-border infiltration, the project was accelerated after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Household surveys were conducted in 2010 for NPR, and demographic data, biometric data and other government identifiers were collected from the population. It is important to note biometrics and government identifiers are sensitive personal data and their misuse can cause significant harm to an individual.\nWhile there was an initial tussle between UIDAI and the Registrar General over whose database will have primacy, this was resolved by the Cabinet Committee on UID in 2010 with the Government deciding that the Registrar General will issue Aadhaar cards instead of Multi-Purpose National Identity Cards. In 2015, NPR was updated and seeded with Aadhaar numbers. The Election Commission also wanted Voter ID details to be mandatorily included in NPR so it could link Voter IDs with Aadhaar through this mechanism. Earlier in 2011, NPR data was used as the basis for the Socio-Economic Caste Census because the Census Act, 1948 prohibited census data from being used. Therefore, NPR became the channel to achieve what could not be done through databases which had higher levels of data protection.\nRecommendations We analysed the NPR project against data protection principles recognized by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgement of K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India and found that it fell short on several aspects.\n  Based on this case study, we recommend the following changes should be made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 to fix loopholes which could lead to a disproportionate encroachment on individual privacy.\n Clause 5 of the PDP Bill should state that only those purposes which are clearly mentioned in the primary legislation enacted by Parliament will qualify as a valid purpose for collection and processing of personal data if the government is building a database. Clause 35 of the PDP Bill should include principles of necessity and proportionality and mandate independent judicial oversight prior to any exemption being granted by the Central Government. This would also be consonant with the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1). In any case, exemption from application of the entire PDP Bill should not be permitted and certain minimal requirements like preservation of quality and integrity of data and adherence to security standards should be required even under Clause 35. Clause 38 of the PDP Bill should be restructured and sub-clauses (d) and (e) should be incorporated as provisos which will serve as a pre-condition for grant of exemption for statistical purposes.

In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.\nEssential First Principles As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (KS Puttaswamy v Union of India) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains\nIn addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the seven privacy principles of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.\nMajor Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:\n1. Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill\nThe Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people\u0026rsquo;s government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill.\n2. Need for a chapter on surveillance reform\nPresently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018.\n3. Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data\nA provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data.\n4. Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure\n The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation. We have noted that the Bill impairs the independence of the DPA by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them. To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having state and regional DPA benches. We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have proposed that it must publish all its decisions.  5. The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.\nThe exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “reasonable purposes” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces.\nIn addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.\nImportant Documents  Covering Letter of the #SaveOurPrivacy Submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee.

On 22nd February 2020, IFF wrote to the Home Department of Jammu and Kashmir (J\u0026amp;K) and key central government departments about the unlawful blocking of access to virtual private networks (VPNs) in J\u0026amp;K. We have demanded immediately revoking the same and restoring complete access to all internet content in the region.\nBackground\nThe internet shutdown in J\u0026amp;K is soon approaching 210 days. In the midst of this, however, internet was partially restored on 18th January 2020 after the Supreme Court’s directions in the Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India judgment. However, the restoration came with restrictions on the use of VPNs and permission to access only a narrow list of whitelisted websites (excluding social media websites). There have been reported instances of people using VPNs getting beaten up by law enforcement authorities. Subsequently, an FIR was lodged against people for using social media platforms via VPNs. The orders blocking VPN access were passed under the Telecom Suspension Rules. However, the FIR has been registered under laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, the Indian Penal Code and, notably section 66A of the Information Technology Act. Section 66A was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2015.\nAs a response we have sent a letter to the Home Department of J\u0026amp;K regarding their move to block access to VPNs. First, we think the blocking is unlawful. Second, the punishment itself is disproportionate. Third, prohibiting the use of VPNs is harmful from a security, privacy and economic perspective. VPNs allow individuals to exchange information at a peer to peer level; protect proprietary secrets; and enable remote business to business collaboration. In particular, even if network traffic is sniffed VPN security models ensure confidentiality of the traffic. They are an essential component of internet browsing as they provide a safe user experience and blocking them actually facilitates censorship.\nTherefore, we have demanded an immediate roll back of this measure and have written to not only the Home Department of J\u0026amp;K but also important Central Ministries, such as Law \u0026amp; Justice; Communications; Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology; Home Affairs; Electronics \u0026amp; Information Technology (MeitY); and Department of Telecommunications (DoT).\nOur Representation\nOur representation was centred on the fact that applications like VPNs and social media websites are over-the-top (OTT) services and therefore fall outside the remit of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and similar frameworks which were used by the J\u0026amp;K Home Department to prohibit public access.\nTo summarise, our representation challenged this measure on the following grounds:\n The parent statute providing legislative backing to the Telecom Suspension Rules and the Unified License Agreement (i.e. the Telegraph Act, 1885) clearly conveys that the framework is meant to regulate the activities of TSPs, ISPs and other backbone infrastructure providers. It does not apply to internet users or OTT content application providers. The IT Act provides for a clear code of offences and remedies for unlawful activity by internet users. Moreover, the IT Act has a specific provision under Section 69-A which allows the Central Government to block OTT applications and specific websites. Since the IT Act provides a modern specialised framework to regulate access to online content applications, the application of a more general law like the Telegraph Act is inappropriate. The current orders in Kashmir which provide a blanket ban on VPNs are arguably violative of the right to privacy and requirements for restrictions of lawfulness, necessity and proportionality.  The Government should stop any future action under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and frameworks thereunder to prohibit access to OTT applications i.e. specific websites and internet content. We also urged the Government of India to take immediate action and restore complete access to all internet content in the region.\nNext Steps\nFor this stage, we encourage you to read our representation and please feel free to shoot us an email on policy@internetfreedom.in if you feel we may have missed something or if you wish to provide any inputs.\nYou could pledge support for the KeepUsOnline campaign: You can strengthen our effort by endorsing this campaign!

These shutdown orders lack legal basis and they violate the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India as well as the the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017.\nCheating in exams =/= Public emergency\nAccording to a news article published in the Telegraph on 18 February, 2020, the West Bengal Government has ordered that the internet will be shut down from the 18-27 February, 2020 in 42 blocks across the 7 districts of Murshidabad, Malda, South Dinajpur, North Dinajpur, Birbhum, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar for the duration of the Class X Madhyamik exams.\n According to the report, suspensions were meant to start at 11.45 am (around the time exams start) till sometime before each day’s test ends. The reported measure aims to prevent leak of question papers through platforms like Whatsapp. At this stage, it is unclear whether the State Government has passed this order under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 (“Telecom Suspension Rules”). As far as we know, there is no publicly available shutdown order which details the legal basis, grounds and exact timings of these period of the internet suspensions. This makes the shutdown inconsistent with prevailing legal standards for two main reasons.  What the law states!\nFirst, the Telecom Suspension Rules can be evoked only to prevent a public emergency or in the interest of public safety. This is a very high threshold and preventing cheating in exams does not satisfy it. In the past, the legality of imposing internet shutdowns to prevent cheating in exams has been challenged before the Rajasthan High Court. However, the case was disposed after the Rajasthan Home Department submitted an affidavit that it would not impose internet shutdowns for this reason again. (Read IFF’s post on the Rajasthan Internet Shutdowns here)\nSecond, on January 10 2020, a three-judge bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India [WP (C) No. 1031 of 2019] recognised that freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and freedom of profession, occupation, trade and business under Article 19(1)(g) extends to the internet. Therefore, restrictions on access to the internet which affect the exercise of these fundamental rights must necessarily satisfy the proportionality standard. In its verdict, the Supreme Court also held that all internet suspension orders must be made available to the public and internet shutdowns cannot be resorted to if there are less restrictive alternatives available.. (Read IFF’s analysis of the judgment here).\nWhy is this a big deal?\nIn an increasingly digital society, an internet shutdown is a shutdown of essential facilities and conveniences such as online banking, ride hailing services, e-commerce platforms etc. It impacts working professionals, freelancers, small and medium business owners and even senior citizens who today rely on it to reach their loved ones and for information gathering to keep themselves safe.\nEven relatively short internet shutdowns can cause significant losses. For instance, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) estimates that telecom operators lose INR 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling. COAI’s Director General, Mr Rajan Mathews has even stated that other businesses which rely on the internet could lose up to 50% of the aforementioned amount. Therefore, a measure by a state government to suspend internet services to prevent cheating is not only disproportionate but completely shortsighted.\nTo prevent internet shutdowns for such reasons, we have called upon the West Bengal government to immediately publish the internet shutdown orders in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India. We have also urged the West Bengal Government to issue a statement that henceforth, internet suspension orders will not be issued in circumstances where there is no public emergency or threat to public safety as required under Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act and the Telecom Suspension Rules.\nImportant Documents\n IFF\u0026rsquo;s Representation to the West Bengal government (link) Telegraph Report titled “Net curb in 7 districts for Madhyamik” dated 18 February, 2020 (link) Rajasthan HC Order dated November 28, 2018 (link)  Want to ensure that your best teacher (Google) is able to help you study?

Although these reports have not been confirmed, sharing and aggregation of public datasets by departments like MoRTH lead to potential risks of safety and fundamental freedoms. With the help of Srinivas Kodali who provided some timely insights and inputs we have co-developed a response to various departments of the Central Government and the Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal. In it we asked them to take immediate remedial measures.\nSo what’s the situation? In context of recent violent clashes in Delhi, disturbing reports emerged this morning which suggested that a database for vehicle registration called Vahan was exploited by malicious actors in identifying vehicles owned by Muslim vehicles, which were allegedly being burnt down. Although, this has not been confirmed by any formal news sources we feel this brings to light a serious human security risk emerging from the ethos of governing personal data.\nWhat’s the risk? In the absence of personal data protection laws to protect people’s online privacy, the Government has been increasingly centralising and aggregating government databases, to extract economic value. An entire chapter in the 2018-19 Economic Survey of India discussed this in great detail. However, these efforts have little regard for individual privacy and do not seek the informed consent of individuals before their personally identifiable information is integrated or used in these datasets. Further, aside from inter-departmental use and sharing of datasets, the Government is also increasingly making these databases available to third parties and even the wider public.\nThe issue with such unfettered sharing of data, without appropriate consent mechanism or legal/institutional safeguards, the data can be misused in a myriad of ways. For instance, the Vahan database is accessible by Government and external parties under the MoRTH’s Bulk Data Sharing Policy. The purpose of this policy is to help the ministry monetise the data which it has in its coffers and allows private parties create solutions and services for its own commercial (or sometimes research) interests. However, in this instance, we have observed the risk of how such Government projects can be misused and can threaten the security and fundamental freedoms of minority and at-risk groups.\nOur Representation Deeply concerned that government administered databases could inadvertently mobilise threats of violence and public property damage, we have written to different departments of the Union Government and the Chief Minister of Delhi articulating our concerns with the Vahan database and immediate actionable steps that we expect leadership to take. Our requests from the government were as follows:\n Immediately stop public and private access to databases like Vahan and Sarathi. Seek a legal opinion from Union Ministry of Law and Justice on the legality of MoRTH monetisation of these databases in light of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in the matter KS Puttaswamy (Retd.) v Union of India. Immediately stop the aggregation of government databases which lead to seamless sharing of individuals’ personal and sensitive personal data without any meaningful consent. Since several third party developers and private firms have already downloaded this data from the Vahan website and related applications. We urge you to issue an urgent advisory for third party mobile applications to remove their applications from respective mobile stores. It is reminded that these private firms and developers have illegally obtained this information and must be held accountable for their actions. The ministry is requested to take legal actions against these private firms and individuals. Finally, moving forward we urge the Government to immediately issue a notification to ensure that public official usage of such datasets adhere to established principles of access control. Such measures are imperative to prevent misuse and/or abuse of personally identifiable datasets.  IFF will keep track on the situation and follow up if necessary. We would like to thank Srinivas Kodali for his inputs without which we would not have been able to send our representation.\nImportant Documents  Link to IFF’s Representation to Government requesting they stop the public access and use of Vahan and other similar databases (click here) To read more about the Vahan database please check out this useful issue brief written by Shashidhar K.J.

What’s even more difficult is finding people who do it in an accessible manner. A large part of my job is to ensure that the work we do reaches people and finding partners who can help us make everyone informed about their digital rights and the threats to it.\nCollaboration has been a central function of growing awareness and providing a basis of civic engagement for more Indians. One of the first attempts we made was when the generous and excellent team from the independent digital media platform, Suno India reached out to us with their, “Cyber Democracy” podcast.\nSuno India’s “Cyber Democracy” explores our digital fears and desires\nIn December last year, we decided to collaborate with Suno India on Cyber Democracy, a podcast that seeks to find out what democracy means in the digital age. This podcast is hosted by Srinivas Kodali, an independent, public interest technologist who has been relentlessly researching and documenting the development of public policy and regulations around tech in India.\nHe uses the audio medium effectively by holding succinct and in-depth conversations with experts and activists alike, making it accessible for the larger public. From using drones to surveil protestors to mass deployment of facial recognition technologies- just when you think we have seen it all, something newer and crazier comes up. The worst part? The everyday Indian knows very little of these developments. This is precisely why collaborations like these become even more important to help us scale our impact. As a community-centric organisation, we need to focus on working with people and communities. Platforms like Suno India and shows like Cyber Democracy help us bridge the gap between our work and people’s understanding of their fundamental rights.\nA podcast that talks about technology policy without being boring\nOne of the first episodes of Cyber Democracy throws light on the government’s reluctance to own up to data leaks and bugs as part of their systems. The episode is called Bugs in Cyberspace and you can listen to it here. It talks about one of the most persistent problems that plague us - the government’s vehement denial in the face of data leaks. A lot of the times, when these bugs have been brought to the attention of the authorities, the researchers simply don’t hear back from them. This is particularly scary in these times of rampant data breaches.\nAnother one of such eye-opening episodes is about the increased use of drones and how their use is regulated and if these regulations are implemented. The episode was called Mechanical Birds. It discovers the history of regulations and how their use has changed over the years. It also speaks about the illegal use of drones during protests (more on this, here) and how these regulations apply to authorities and if they even need permits in the first place. Listen to the whole episode here.\nAs someone who hasn’t studied law, I’m not familiar with a lot of the technical and legal terms that are often thrown around when we discuss these issues. It’s important that people understand what’s exactly at stake so they can fight back and help us fight back. One of the bugs that Karan from the Bugs In Cyberspace episode found in the Indian Gases web API impacted 600 million potential users whose records were stored in the database.\nTune in, today.\nAnd now, after a series of insightful episodes and discovering things that make you wonder if you heard that right - This season of Cyber Democracy is going to end soon. Podcasts like these help us find newer ways to engage with people and communities. In other words, they have our back when we need it the most.\nThe entire team at IFF is so thankful to have worked with Srinivas Kodali and Suno India on Cyber Democracy and we look can’t wait to see what’s in store for season two.\nCyber Democracy is available on all streaming platforms.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/what-does-democracy-mean-in-the-digital-age-cyber-democracy-seeks-to/","summary":"What does democracy mean in the digital age?

In this blogpost, we will trace the debate on FRT usage, and conclude by proposing the imposition of a moratorium on these projects.\nSpike in Facial Recognition Technology Usage FRT has become increasingly ubiquitous in the daily lives of people from China’s surveillance state to the iPhones (or the Redmi phones) with a face unlock feature in our pockets. The previous posts have detailed how India is steadily warming up to the use of this technology for a plethora of functions. However, it is essential to clearly articulate how the data collected through this exercise will be used and safeguarded. This post will look at the solutions that some jurisdictions have tried to introduce and make the case for a moratorium being the best suited for India.\nTracing the Debate Countries such as China and Russia have seen unsuccessful legal challenges to FRT wherein Courts have held that there has been no breach of privacy in both these instances. Hence, we must turn to countries which have taken a more proactive stance on dealing with this technology by envisaging diverse forms of regulation, such as:\n Complete bans, Regulations applicable on public authorities or private players, and Moratoriums.  Bans The US city of Somerville, MA has placed a ban on any city officials/departments or people contracted by the city from employing this technology. The reasons it has given are as follows:\n Women, young people and people of colour have a higher risk of ‘false positive’ identifications; Databases which FRT is applied to are plagued by racial biases which in turn generates copycat biases in face surveillance data; and The public use of face surveillance can chill the exercise of constitutionally protected free speech.  Other places such in the US have taken a similar stance and imposed complete bans on FRT by public officials (San Francisco, Cambridge, Oakland) or in body worn cameras by law enforcement officers (in Oregon). However, a well-executed ban would require thought and deliberation. For instance, in San Francisco, the initial ban had to be amended to allow employees to use FaceID on their government-issued iPhones, a feature that didn’t seem to have been adequately considered beforehand.\nClare Garvie of the Georgetown Law Center for Privacy and Technology has pressed the need to first define what is meant by ‘facial recognition’. Does it simply mean matching of facial images or anonymised sentiment analysis, and any other current uses? A robust regulation would also need to take into account the global nature of the technology industry. Face-recognition algorithms used in one country may be made by a company from another country. Does such a ban simply mean a ban on the purchase of that technology, meant to be applied within the borders of one country, or does it also extend to import of FRT from another country. She concludes by saying that there is no political will and global capacity to entirely prevent the use or development of FRT around the world.\nRegulations Concurrently, countries which have embraced the use of FRT and are devising methods to regulate it. Last year when the South Wale Police’s use of FRT was challenged in the High Court of Justice, the Court did not find it violative of their data protection standards or other relevant laws. Moreover, it held that the use of this technology balanced the interests of the community (safety) and individual (privacy), and fell within the ambit of their existing laws. On the basis of this case, the Information Commissioner of the UK has recommended cogently laying down how these laws govern the use of this technology.\nThe US state of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) lays down strict standards which are applicable to private entities. It requires written consent before collecting someone’s biometric information (one of which is face geometry). Biometric data is particularly sensitive information because it is unique to every individual. Passwords and social security numbers, for example, can be changed in the event of breach, but a face cannot. Under BIPA, individuals can sue anyone violating their privacy rights even absent a financial injury resulting from the violation. Facebook has been held liable under BIPA for illegally collecting and storing facial recognition data for its ‘Tag Suggestions’ feature.\nHowever, exceptions exist. A private entity has to disclose the collected biometric data if it is a requirement under state/federal/municipal law, a warrant or a subpoena. The State of Washington, US - home of Big Tech companies Amazon and Microsoft - has also proposed a bill which will regulate private entities using FRT and has similar exceptions, i.e., making disclosures to government authorities if it is permitted under existing laws. For those looking to implement laws similar to these, the principal question that arises is whether there are enough existing safeguards in place to successfully protect people’s data. A question, as we have previously noted, India cannot answer in the affirmative since the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP Bill) has still not been implemented.\nMoratoriums Civil liberty organisations advocate putting a halt on the use of FRT until further debate. Realistically speaking, it is prudent to recognise the widespread adoption of FRT and begin contemplating how we will address its worst tendencies. In its recently published white paper on the use of Artificial Intelligence, the European Union concluded with pressing upon the need to have a sustained conversation about how to adequately regulate the use of this technology. It invites comments from various stakeholders so that standards may be set down.\nSimilarly, the US Congress has been under pressure from activists and concerned citizens to take action on FRT regulation. Consequently, two Senators in the US have recently put forth a legislation which proposes a moratorium while a Commission - comprising law enforcement and immigration enforcement officials, privacy and technology experts and communities most impacted negatively by the use of FRT - submits a report with its recommendations to the Congress. The Congress must then pass a law to regulate FRT within a specified timeframe.\nSo what should India do? Based on the observations in our previous post, FRT systems in India need a lot of fine tuning before they can be rolled out properly. Further, based on India’s experience with Aadhaar, it would be advisable to hit pause and contemplate the serious challenges that come with an invasive technology. Retrospectively regulating an already introduced measure would be an extremely difficult task and would mean setting ourselves up for failure. Taking the lead in flagging this issue, we propose a moratorium of three years on the ongoing FRT projects in India which would mean pressing pause on these projects. We also hope to have more clarity in this regard once the Personal Data Protection Bill is passed.\nIn the meanwhile, a thoughtful dialogue is required where government, industry, civil society, human rights groups, academia and similar stakeholders have a proactive dialogue which can articulate a policy-making/legislative pathway on the issue. The conversation must be nuanced enough to differentiate between different uses of the technology which can span governance, monitoring, law enforcement, commercial, R\u0026amp;D, academia, healthcare, and many more unforeseeable domains. However, as we have previously observed in this series, the Indian Government and some members of industry are essentially running the risk of placing the proverbial cart before the horse. The need for a conversation is urgent and we will use these global learnings to inform our own position moving forward.\n(This post has been authored by Ashi Mehta, a legal intern at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffers, Sidharth and Devdutta.)\nImportant Documents  On Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust (link) Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Act (link) Introduction to Facial Recognition Projects in India (link) Problems with Facial Recognition Technology Operating in a Legal Vacuum (link)  “Oops!

While the obvious problem is that a faulty system with a high error rate may be implemented, the implementation of an accurate FRT system also raises serious privacy concerns.\nFacial Recognition Technology: Process and Function To understand the problems associated with FRT implementation, we first need to understand how FRT works. As Smriti Parsheera explains in her recent paper, the process can be summarised in the following steps:\n Detection of face in an image and/or video. For instance, phone cameras apply this feature when they auto-focus on a face while capturing a photo. Extraction of particular features from the detected image. Recognition which results in either identification or verification of an individual.  Identification happens when FRT is used to identify an individual from a pool of many people. This kind of 1: many FRT based identification is typically used for security and surveillance purposes. Verification, on the other hand, occurs when an image is compared to another image from an existing database in order to verify that the individual is who he/she claims to be, i.e., authentication of identity on a 1:1 basis.\nImplementation of a Faulty FRT System Claims relating to accuracy of FRT systems are routinely exaggerated and the real numbers leave much to be desired. For instance, in 2018, Delhi Police reported that its FRT system had an accuracy rate of 2% which fell to 1% in 2019 with the system even failing to accurately distinguish between girls and boys.\nThe implementation of such faulty FRT systems would lead to high rates of false positives and false negatives in this recognition process.\n A false positive occurs when FRT gives an incorrect positive result wherein the system misidentifies an individual as someone he/she is not. This may lead to discrimination and strengthening of existing biases. For instance, ACLU found that Amazon’s facial recognition software “Rekognition” incorrectly matched 28 members of the US Congress with people who had been arrested for committing a crime. Of those members who were incorrectly matched, 40% were people of color which is a disproportionate number since people of color make up only 20% of the US Congress. A false negative occurs when the FRT gives an incorrect negative result wherein the system is unable to recognize an individual or authenticate his/her identity. This may lead to arbitrary exclusion of an individual from government schemes and benefits. Failure of biometric based authentication under Aadhaar has led to many people being excluded from receiving essential government services and even led to starvation deaths. Such problems will be further aggravated by an inaccurate FRT system.  In India, FRT systems are being developed and deployed by government and private entities without any technical standards in place which may lead faulty systems being implemented (Read more about these FRT projects here). Once in place, it would be very difficult for them to be reconciled with future technical standards and damage like discrimination and exclusion would be impossible to undo.\nImplementation of an Accurate FRT System While there have been claims of a fully accurate FRT system, none of these claims have been corroborated by independent review and audit. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has extensively tested FRT systems for 1:1 verification and 1:many identification and how accuracy of these systems vary across demographic groups. These independent studies have concluded that currently, no FRT system has 100% accuracy.\nAn accurate FRT system would hypothetically have a 100% success rate in 1:1 verification and/or 1:many identification. However, it will come with its own ominous connotations, the most problematic of which may be state led mass surveillance and difficulty for outside actors to counter-challenge government decisions.\n _Lack of Informed Consent_Probe images for FRT systems are often collected by the police through CCTV cameras installed in public spaces. Individuals in a CCTV surveilled area may be aware that they are under surveillance but the assumption is that this surveillance is temporary. Use of CCTV in conjunction with FRT would mean their images will be stored for a longer period of time, if not permanently. This data will also be used to extract particular data points such as the facial features and other biometrics which the individual has not consented to sharing when entering a CCTV surveilled zone and these data points can be used to track future movements of the person. Therefore, integration of FRT with a network of CCTV cameras would make real time surveillance extremely easy.Even if individuals do consent to their images being processed by an FRT system, is this consent informed? For example, the Digi Yatra Program introduced in various airports is touted to be a voluntary initiative and has a policy which assures passengers that “personal data shall be obtained only for the specified lawful purpose, and shall not be further processed in any manner other than for that purpose or those purposes.” However, the same policy also contains an exception which allows sharing of passenger data with “any Security Agency, Bureau of Immigration(BOI) or other Govt. Agency” based on existing protocols. Individuals who have consented to having their information processed under Digi Yatra may often be unaware of this exception. _Lack of legislation containing mandatory safeguards_Deployment of FRT at national and state levels without adequate legal safeguards is deeply troubling. Specific laws with regard to FRT and personal data protection do not currently exist in India. While a flawed Personal Data Protection Bill has been introduced in the Parliament (read more here), there is uncertainty about when it will be enacted and implemented and how effective it will be in protecting the personal data of individuals. Under the current version of the Bill, wide exceptions have been provided to the Government for surveillance related activities. A strong data protection legislation is needed to hold these FRT systems accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties. Violation of Fundamental Rights The implementation of an accurate FRT system would also violate fundamental rights by facilitating mass surveillance. For instance, there will be a chilling effect on the right to freedom of speech and expression because people will be wary of being prosecuted in case they express anti-government sentiments. Further, the right to freedom of movement would be hampered as mass surveillance would allow the government to track the movements of individuals in real time across the country. Finally, the right to privacy will be violated as sensitive personal data which is collected by these FRT systems will be used by the Government without the informed consent of the individual. This would also hamper the individual from exercising the liberty to share their information in some contexts and remain anonymous in others according to their individual choice.  In conclusion, implementation of FRT systems in India has the potential of turning the country into a surveillance state. The problems that arise would not only affect the fundamental rights and civil liberties of individuals but also create mistrust towards any positive initiatives that the Government might undertake if no legal safeguards and best practices are put in place.\n(This blogpost has been authored by Anushka Jain, a legal intern at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffers, Devdutta and Sidharth.)\nImportant Documents  Introduction to Facial Recognition Projects in India (link)  “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” - Indian Govt, Circa 2020.

In the first part of this three part series on FRT, we have mapped major FRT projects in different states and broadly classified them into two categories according to intended purpose: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.\nThe Government needs to calm down! In 2015, Jacky Alcine was surprised to find an auto-generated album in his Google Photos folder which contained a photo of his African-American friends categorized as “Gorillas.” This categorization had been done by the facial recognition software that Google Photos used to automatically sort any photos uploaded by the user. After Jacky posted this image on Twitter, the resultant outrage was immediate and understandable and Google promptly removed the offending categorization.\nIn order to understand why this error occurred and why many civil liberties organizations are calling for a ban or a moratorium on FRT, we need to understand how machine learning occurs and how bias in the samples used will lead to bias in the recognition done by the software. However, even before understanding these important questions and trying to come up with workable solutions and standards, the Central Government and different State Governments have already started deploying FRT for two major purposes: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.\nFacial Recognition for Security/Surveillance One of the biggest causes of alarm currently is the Request For Proposals (RFP) issued by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) which would be used to create a national database of photographs which would help in swiftly identifying criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like Passport, CCTNS , ICJS and Prisons, WCD Ministry\u0026rsquo;s KhoyaPaya, NAFIS or any other image database available with police/other entity.\nWhile this national level project is still in nascent stages, police departments of various states are already in possession of FRT developed by public and/or private developers such as:\n TSCOP + CCTNS in Telangana Punjab Artificial Intelligence System (PAIS) in Punjab Trinetra in Uttar Pradesh Police Artificial Intelligence System in Uttarakhand AFRS in Delhi Automated Multimodal Biometric Identification System (AMBIS) in Maharashtra FaceTagr in Tamil Nadu  We have already sent a notice to the Delhi Police over their illegal use of FRT during the recent protests in Delhi (Read about it here). In Telangana as well, there have been multiple instances where police officers have been illegally asking individuals to submit their biometrics.\nSimultaneously, the Ministry of Railways has also announced its own facial recognition based security/surveillance system called Internet Protocol (IP) based Video Surveillance System (VSS) to be provided by RailTel under the Nirbhaya Fund. The South Western Railway started implementing the first phase of this project, and it has stated in a press release that it has been successful in developing a suitable facial recognition system which has 100% success rate in acquisition and matching of faces.\nFacial Recognition for Authentication of Identity In a press release, the Ministry of Civil Aviation announced the Digi Yatra Programme which primarily aims to increase the ease and efficiency with which passengers at airports are processed from the moment they step into the airport till they board their flight by making the whole process paperless and using the biometrics (face) of the passenger as their boarding pass. The Government has already started rolling out Digi Yatra on a trial basis in different airports like Hyderabad (July 2018), Delhi (September 2018) and Bengaluru (December 2018).\nRecently, the Telangana State Election Commission also came up with a similar idea to counter impersonation in polls. TSEC with the help of the Telangana State Technology Services tested FRT in 10 polling stations in Kompally Municipality of Medchal Malkajgiri district by using the technology to verify the identity of voters by comparing the photographs taken at the polling station with photographs of the voters in the TSEC database.\nFRTs are increasingly being used by educational institutions to verify the presence of teachers and students. The Gujarat Government has introduced a FRT system with a geo-tagging feature which ensures that primary school teachers themselves are present in schools and they are not being replaced by unauthorized and unqualified “proxy” teachers. Elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, the Government Higher Secondary School in Triplicane has installed a camera which is equipped with FRT in order to mark attendance of students. Similarly, IIT Delhi also has a FRT enabled attendance app in place which is called Timble.\nThe most recent use of FRT for authentication of identity that we came across is proposed use of the technology by the Maharashtra Government in order to record who avails its Shiv Bhojan Scheme. Shiv Bhojan is a scheme aimed for impoverished sections of society, wherein in select locations around Mumbai, the Government will serve thalis of food at a nominal rate of Rs.10.\nFighting Back against FRT FRT projects are becoming dangerously popular in India with various national level projects (AFRS, DigiYatra and IP VSS) underway. However, all these projects have been implemented without any legislative framework governing their operation. Be that as it may, the most worrisome part is not just the implementation of a faulty FRT system but also the implementation of an accurate system which could become a tool of mass surveillance. These problems will be discussed in the next part of this series.\nTo counter this grave threat to the privacy of all Indians, IFF has taken various steps. We have sent legal notices to NCRB and Delhi Police against use of FRT without any statutory basis or procedural safeguards. We have also filed Right to Information requests in conjunction to every such instance of FRT that we have come across. We will keep you updated as and when we receive responses to our RTI requests.\n(This post has been authored by Anushka Jain, a legal intern at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer, Devdutta.)\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s notice to NCRB, NCRB\u0026rsquo;s reply and IFF\u0026rsquo;s rejoinder.

IFF responded to TRAI’s ongoing public consultation on net neutrality enforcement. We have provided recommendations to ensure India has meaningful net neutrality which goes beyond mere reference within legal systems. Our response addresses the need to remove scope for discretion, increase transparency and accountability, boost the local measurement ecosystem, and build better more-inclusive institutions.\nBackground As we have previously written, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is in the midst of a public consultation on net neutrality enforcement. The issue is of course very close to our hearts, since it was the rallying cry which brought together more than a million Indian internet users under the SaveTheInternet.in campaign. It is their collective voices which helped steer telecom authorities in recognising the principles of an open, fair and equitable internet. The principle is meant to help ensure that your internet provider cannot dictate your experience online. You can read about the historicity of the issue here.\nThe net neutrality principle (which was formalised in July 2018), prohibits your internet provider from discriminating (economically or technically) between different types of internet traffic/applications. Economic disrimination is reasonably easy to detect and is explicitly regulated through the Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016. However, without an actual enforcement regime we noticed that technical discrimination was going ahead unimpeded. As a result we brought back the SaveTheInternet.in campaign and petitioned authorities like TRAI to work towards developing an enforcement framework to internet providers accountable.\nWell, yesterday i.e. 13th February, 2020 was the last day for initial comments to TRAI on issues relating to enforcement. The consultation relates to both technical standards on how to identify disproportionate or discriminatory traffic management; and the composition of a multistakeholder institution which will work with Government in framing standards and requirements to uphold the net neutrality principle.\nOur Top Concerns and Recommendations: We have emailed our recommendations to TRAI and IFF’s primary focus is ensuring that the actual implementation of the framework remains individual and user centric. Our aim is to ensure that the framework does not drift towards a scenario where your internet provider has undue influence on the actual enforcement. The primary risks which could arise due to an ineffective framework include:\n Regulations which offer internet providers a pass and they do not have to publish enough information (in terms of quality and quantity). Vague regulations which offer your provider with enough discretion to discriminate between different types of services on an arbitrary basis. Think of a scenario wherein your gaming streams, P2P file sharing applications or encrypted traffic is performing worse because your internet provider has made some decision behind closed doors. Prolonged “wait and watch approach” could be used as a veil which prevents any enforcement mechanism in the interim. A dearth appropriate traffic measurement systems Finally, if a multistakeholder body, which is meant to be representative of the entire public, and will advise authorities on enforcement is cornered by your internet provider and large internet businesses.  Our recommendations have addressed these issues head-on and provided substantive recommendations to mitigate each of these risks, among other issues. However, there is more to be done and we must remain vigilant.\nNext steps and how can you participate! The consultation remains open and the next stage is the Counter Comments phase. February 27, 2020 is the last day by when the public can submit counter comments to TRAI.\nFor this stage, we encourage you to read our submission and please feel free to shoot us an email on [policy@internetfreedom.in] if you feel we may have missed something or if you wish to provide any inputs. Due to the technical nature of the consultation we would be especially keen on inputs from technical experts, network engineers and other concerned citizens.\nYou could Sign the “Take Action” Petition: While such enforcement frameworks are being devised and will take time, there exist clear breaches of net neutrality in the form of illegal website blocking by ISPs. This is the clearest form of existing violations of binding license regulations.

This code industry wide code is signed by just 4 online video streaming providers and is intended to apply to the entire sector. It will require self-censorship practices which are there in the Television sector to be implemented for online video streaming services such as Arre, Amazon Prime, MX Player and Netflix. The code also creates a private body called the Digital Content Complaint Council (DCCC) to judge complaints and impose penalties. As per press reports it will be headed by Justice A.P. Shah who is a steadfast defenders of civil liberties and democratic values. With a view to place the several concerns of institutionalised self-censorship and chilling effects, we wrote him an open letter yesterday.\nIn detail In the past we have repeatedly warned of the dangers of a dangerous self-censorship system for online video services that is being championed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (\u0026ldquo;IAMAI\u0026rdquo;). This system is called the, \u0026ldquo;Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers\u0026rdquo; and we have in detail explained how this will cause tremendous damage to artistic creativity, user choice and innovation in the video streaming sector. This essentially institutionalises a dangerous TV style self-censorship system that will have a chilling effect on the diversity of content and programming.\nThis \u0026ldquo;Self Regulatory\u0026rdquo; code also creates a judicial body with what is called as a, \u0026ldquo;Tier 2\u0026rdquo; for adjudicating any complaints on the content of the shows which are aired on online video streaming services. This body is called the Digital Content Complaint Council (\u0026ldquo;DCCC\u0026rdquo;) and when the intial complaints to the signatories of this code (which are online streaming companies) are not settled, it hears them as a judicial case. It also will determine complaints sent by government departments and also can take suo-motu action. Such powers are generally modelled from the Broadcast Content Complaint Council (\u0026ldquo;BCCC\u0026rdquo;) that is a body for television broadcasters in India. The results of such practices in the TV sector are for everyone to see (or, due to censorship not see).\nAs per media reports the first Chairperson of the DCCC is the distinguished jurist and the retired Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Justice (Retd.) Mr. A.P. Shah. We hold Justice Shah in the highest regard for his intellect and courage in being a consistent voice for democratic rights - especially media freedoms. Due to the lack of response by the IAMAI we, yesterday sent an open letter to Justice Shah highliting our concerns and prior correspondence. This is in our continuing effort that self-censorship practices that have made TV broadcast an arid medium do not migrate to the internet.\nOur letter to Justice Shah is a good faith effort. We have the highest faith in his ability to adjudicate and hold this position while protecting free expression. However, the larger, industry wide model that is being institutionalised and is likely to be cemented that will last beyond his term is injurious.\nImportant Documents  An open letter to Justice A.P.

Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.\nYour boss shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be Big Boss Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise.\nRecommendations In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.\n The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.  Read the public brief and engage with the JPC For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.\nIf you are a trade union or employee association which needs more information about the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, please feel free to reach out to us at policy@internetfreedom.in. We encourage people to share this brief widely in their circles and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.

Based on these grounds we have asked the industry body to roll back the code and asked government authorities to refrain from endorsing the framework.\nBackground This post is to update everyone that there is a risk brewing in India’s online video streaming space. And said risk could see us sleep walk into a scenario where online content in India, mimics its formulaic television counterpart. On 5th February 2020, at its annual India Digital Summit, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) launched its Code for Self-Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. It follows up an earlier Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers the industry body had put out in January 2019.\nUnlike the previous code which had nine signatories, the latest iteration has just four signatories namely, Hotstar, Voot, Jio and SonyLiv. Prior signatories including Netflix, Zee5, AltBalaji, Arre and ErosNow were conspicuously absent at the new code’s launch. Other major players like Amazon (Prime) and Google (YouTube Premium) have stayed away from the process since its inception. Considering India has more than 35 online video streaming providers, the Code is not really representative of the entire industry’s position. So then why are we concerned if it is only being carried out by such a small number of players?\nOur Take: This is a precursor to self-censorship and for online streaming to go down the path of TV Simply put it is the first step towards broad basing self-censorship as industry practice in India’s online video streaming space. If that is indeed the outcome, it would adversely impact internet users in India, creators, artists, production companies and so on. It is also likely to harm competition, innovation, investment and would facilitate industry capture by a few firms over the ecosystem.\nThe framework essentially builds on the original code of best practices through some key changes. First and most importantly, it seeks to establish an independent enforcement authority called the Digital Content Complaint Council (DCCC) to oversee a signatory’s content related practices. This DCCC mechanism is eerily similar and largely derivative of the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC) (under the Indian Broadcasting Foundation) which essentially governs content on non-news and television channels in India.\nWe all know what that has meant to Indian television and how that has led to a largely homogenous content ecosystem, inundated by typical saas-bahu programming devoid of much creativity or pathos. Moreover, how often do we watch our favourite international content on TV and get bummed out that a large chunk of the programming has been edited out? In this context, the online video streaming space was a breadth of fresh air for Indian audiences who were fans of global and local storytelling. Further, it provided opportunities to local storytellers who had until then been rejected by traditional television, theatrical and radio media.\nThe legal basis and policy need for this effort is questionable at best In this context, it is disconcerting that even though there is no legal mechanism which empowers the DCCC, its ties with the Government are undeniable. The proposed DCCC is meant to be chaired by a retired High Court or Supreme Court judge. Also, the DCCC is designed to include three members from national level statutory commissions like the National Commission for Women (NCW), the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) or the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Its composition would also facilitate incumbent business capture as the DCCC is meant to include three industry representatives and two online curated content providers (likely to be signatories to the Code). Considering the opaque manner (with no public/stakeholder inputs) in which the Code has been developed, and the public facing impact such a privately designed framework can have\u0026ndash; the legal validity of this effort remains dubious at best.\nSecond, such codified structures essentially provide the Government a parallel avenue with little to no legal accountability to apply pressure on businesses to censor people’s views and beliefs. It erodes channels for dissent and satire\u0026ndash; and is arguably incompatible with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India.\nThird, like the previous code on best practices, the new code for self-regulation talks about “prohibited content”. What is particularly dangerous is that the newest draft has been modified in a manner which makes the grounds for censorship vaguer. This would afford the DCCC with more discretion to remove certain speech/content which would otherwise be legal under the Constitution of India and also applicable laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. This is compounded by the fact that the DCCC does not envision membership of stakeholders from research, academia or free speech backgrounds, to act as a safeguard for people’s right to receive and impart information. Therefore, it may be concluded that this Code is merely a liability reduction initiative which is being pushed through at the cost of plurality, diversity and creativity\u0026ndash; all cornerstone’s of the right to free speech and expression.\nOur letter to IAMAI In a letter dated 17th January, 2019 we had previously written to the IAMAI voicing our objection to the initial Code for Best Practices. We argued it was a slippery slope which would act as a precursor towards self-censorship in the Indian online content space. Our beliefs are reinforced by the latest Code for Self-Regulation and we have sent a representation to the IAMAI requesting them to roll back the effort. In addition, we have shared a copy with both the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), to brief them with the issues of endorsing the framework.\nImportant Documents  The latest Code for Self-Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers released by IAMAI on 5th February, 2020. Our letter sent to IAMAI, also copied to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers released by IAMAI and signed by 9 players in January 2019. Our letter dated 17th January, 2019 to the IAMAI outlining our concerns relating to the initial IAMAI Code of Best Practices.  Want India to produce its own South Park or BoJack Horseman?

Rai, Apar Gupta)\u0026rdquo;\n  Does our work need to pick up pace, quality, and impact? We believe it does. Many, if not most Indians today face challenges to their fundamental rights as our society transforms with the growing adoption of technology. This is a problem statement we studied closely over last year and decided to scale up and assemble a team of motivated, talented staffers that work on delivering on our public commitments. Today, through this post we introduce our 2020 team.\nWe would first like to thank and congratulate Joanne D’Cunha who served as IFF’s first policy and organisational counsel in 2019. Over the course of a year she helped execute key projects, build our culture of engagement and support sharp policy engagements which resulted in public victories. Joanne transitioned to a research role in keeping with her long term interest at Tandem Research and while all of us here at IFF miss her tremendously, we wish her the very best! She remains a part of the IFF community and we will hope to keep on drawing on her time and skills.\nWe need to move fast and fix things\nIt is a testament to the work the board of trustees, volunteers and donors that IFF today has 6 full time staff and one legal of-counsel. We have hired the best and our thought process in making these hires has been to search for young people who have a drive and passion towards becoming leaders in their respective fields. Our hires have been premised on the basis of actual needs and belief on the need to match the power of citizen movements and online collectives with credible institutional engagement.\nWith these broad principles in mind we have doubled down on our capacity to conduct and support strategic litigation. This is through Devdutta Mukhopadhyay and IFF’s Of Counsel, Vrinda Bhandari. Devdutta commenced her internship in March, 2019 and joined IFF in July, 2019 after graduating from the National Law University, Delhi. Vrinda, needs little introduction. She is a seasoned litigator, a Rhodes Scholar and a graduate of National Law School India University, Bangalore.\nWe have also now focussed resources towards sustainable government and parliamentary engagement. This comes with the hire of Sidharth Deb as IFF’s “Policy and Parliamentary Counsel” in February, 2020. Sidharth is a 2016 graduate from the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata. He previously worked at Koan Advisory Group and interned at research organisations like the Centre for Communication Governance (CCG) and the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS).\nFor impact and growth, we need to invest in the community\nIFF is not just an organisation for lawyers and policy wonks. We have to remain rooted and continue to make our work public centred. To do this we have two roles which will help us build a culture through actual practice rather than mere words. The first is headed by Shivani Singh who is the Organizational and Community Manager. She is a graduate of English Literature from Sophia College for Women and started interning with IFF in October, 2019 having joined us full time in January, 2020. Shivani has been the force behind IFF’s increasing collaborations (notice all the partnerships and events?) and comes with a rich experience from being an assistant artist manager at Kommune in sensing and matching public expectations with organisational responses. She helps IFF do its burgeoning work, its financial and reporting compliances implemented with discipline. It’s a core role given the increased regulatory scrutiny that exists on the civil society sector.\nOur most recent hire is Farkhanda Zahoor, who heads Fundraising and Communications and has joined IFF in February, 2020. She is a graduate from St. Stephens College and completed her Masters in Mass Communication and Media Studies from AJK Mass Communication Research Centre, Jamia Millia Islamia. By rolling in a fundraising and communications role we are making sure that the pace and impact of our work results in greater public and individual funding that brings greater financial sustainability to our model. With her skills that exist in digital storytelling we hope to be more conversational and public centred as much as we continue complex, nuanced policy work.\nOld faithfuls\nDharminder Kumar Rai has been with us since the beginning as our office manager. Without him we cannot do our work. He makes sure all our legal notices and RTIs go out, and our lunch gets in. He is a tremendous asset to our office who brings comfort and a sense of support to make our work possible. This leaves me. As the Executive Director of a young digital rights organisation, I look forward to supporting this growing team deploy their full talent and skills at IFF while leading on the many commitments made when IFF turned into a staffed organisation.\nFinally, is this team static? How much does IFF plan to grow in 2020? While we are not making a clear public commitment on this, we have some guiding principles. We intend to remain a small team. There are several reasons for this decision but it primarily has to cater with remaining agile while also reaching a level of greater financial stability. We may look at hires in two further roles, namely a public interest technologist and an online campaigner.\nWe will keep you updated on our progress. All of the work IFF’s staff does is funded by donors like you, and I encourage you to reach across to any of the team members.

Union of India. FMP was an intervenor in the case, and its representation criticises the whitelisting regime of internet censorship currently prevailing in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir for being unconstitutional and technically infeasible. In addition to this, FMP has also sought disclosure of all past orders and recommendations of the Review Committee.\nStatus of Restrictions After the Supreme Court delivered its judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India on 10 January, the Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir has partially restored internet access through multiple orders. Through the order issued on 24 January, only 2G internet access has been provided to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir to access 301 whitelisted websites while millions of other websites remain blocked. Notably, websites of political parties and social media platforms continue to remain blocked in Jammu and Kashmir.\nWhitelisting is Unconstitutional A whitelisting regime of internet censorship is unconstitutional because it inverses the constitutional design of fundamental rights being the norm and restrictions being the exception. For these reasons, Section 69A, IT Act 2000 empowers the government to block access to websites hosting illegal content after following proper procedure. However, until such websites are specifically identified and blocked after following the prescribed procedure, the default position is that all websites remain accessible. If the Government is concerned about misinformation and incitement of violence, it may selectively blacklist websites which contain illegal content but it cannot impose a generic ban on all websites and selectively whitelist certain websites.\nBy inverting the basic logic underpinning our Constitution, whitelisting makes arbitrary state action inevitable. Since government officials do not have to apply their mind before blocking access to a specific website, many websites are not whitelisted merely because government officials are not aware of them. There is also no explanation provided regarding why certain websites remain blocked while other websites belonging to the same category are whitelisted.\nWhitelisting is Technically Infeasible In the last week, there has been some excellent analysis by Rohini Lakshane, Prateek Waghre and others on why a whitelisting regime of censorship is not technically feasible owing to the interconnected nature of the internet. Drawing on this research, the representation highlights that 301 websites which have been whitelisted by the government will be fully functional only if the web application is permitted to make network calls to other websites to load JavaScript, style sheets, maps, videos, images, analytics etc. For instance, having access to an e-commerce platform like Amazon is meaningless unless the customer is also able to see images of the product that he/she wants to buy. Further, in many cases, while the website’s main domain has been whitelisted, its subdomains which contain the log in page or other important features remain blocked. Therefore, a large number of these 301 websites are not practically usable for the residents of Jammu and Kashmir.\nNo Disclosure of Past Orders In its judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, the Supreme Court has held that the government must proactively publish all orders issued under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. The Supreme Court has also clarified that the government cannot cite administrative inconvenience to refuse publication of orders. However, despite this explicit direction, the Government of Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir has not published past orders issued between 05 August 2019 to 14 January 2020 on its website or any publically accessible forum.\nNo Disclosure of Review Committee Recommendations The Supreme Court has mandatorily directed the Review Committee constituted under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017 to periodically review the need for suspension of telecommunication services every seven working days. However, there is no information available in the public domain about whether the Review Committee has complied with this direction and what recommendations were made by the Review Committee, if any.\nLawyers retained by IFF represented FMP before the Supreme Court and provided drafting assistance for this representation. We will continue supporting individuals and organizations seeking restoration of internet services in Jammu and Kashmir and all across India.\nImportant Documents  Representation sent to J\u0026amp;K Govt by FMP (link)  Judicial decisions should not become mere parchment barriers.

However, empirical evidence suggests that CCTV cameras are not effective at preventing violence against women, and without any guidelines governing their operation, these cameras will be used against women for voyeurism and moral policing. The fundamental right to privacy exists even in public spaces, and therefore, any use of video surveillance should be within a proper legislative framework with adequate safeguards, and it should be preceded by privacy impact assessments and followed by post ante audits to assess effectiveness.\nBackground The Women and Child Development Ministry (WCD Ministry) has recommended that Rs. 2919.55 crores from the Nirbhaya Fund should be used for the Safe City Project proposed __ by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Large scale video surveillance through CCTV cameras is a crucial component of the Safe City Project. While the objective of the Nirbhaya Fund and the Safe City Project is ensuring safety of women, mass installation of CCTV cameras will not serve this purpose.\nThe Problem is Bigger than Stranger Danger We must remember that the vast majority of sexual violence and domestic violence in India happens within the confines of the home, and not in public places. For instance, according to NCRB data from 2016, 94.6% of rapes in India are committed by perpetrators known to the victim such as family members, friends or acquaintances. Therefore, installation of CCTV cameras in public places by itself will have a minimal impact on prevention and investigation of violence against women.\nAre CCTV Cameras Effective? Even when violence against women is perpetrated by strangers in public spaces, there is little evidence that CCTV cameras will be effective at preventing such crimes. In 2008, a systematic review of 44 studies from 5 countries on the effectiveness of CCTV systems concluded CCTV cameras have a modest effect on personal property crime but they did not reduce violent crime. Other empirical studies also suggest that mass video surveillance may not a suitable method to prevent violence against women and other solutions such as increased street lighting maybe more effective.\nPan-Tilt-Zoom into Women’s Private Lives Unless there are strict guidelines and safeguards to prevent misuse of CCTV cameras, the video surveillance infrastructure established under the Safety City Project could become a tool for voyeurism, extortion, stalking and harassment of women. The risk of such misuse is especially higher if footage from CCTV cameras is shared with private individuals and organizations like Resident Welfare Associations.\nEmpirical studies have found that 10% of all targeted surveillance on women and 15% of operator-initiated surveillance on women is for voyeuristic reasons. In addition to this, there are several real life examples of CCTV cameras facilitating voyeurism, and targets have included even prominent political leaders such as the WCD Minister, Mrs. Smriti Irani and the German Chancellor, Ms. Angela Merkel.\nAnother Type of Creep We Should Worry About Since large scale installation of CCTV cameras under the Safe City Project lacks any governing legislative framework, it is highly vulnerable to function creep with advancement in facial recognition and gait analysis technologies. Footage from CCTV cameras could also be used as training data for facial recognition and gait analysis systems without the knowledge and consent of ordinary law abiding citizens featured in the footage.\nNeed for Evidence Based Rights Respecting Policy In light of the above mentioned concerns, we have urged the WCD Ministry to reconsider its decision to invest massive resources in large scale video surveillance projects and consider supporting alternatives such as street lighting, better civic amenities for women, counselling facilities, gender sensitisation in educational institutions etc.\nAfter balancing the likely harms, if installation of CCTV cameras is still deemed necessary in specific areas, it must be done within a proper statutory framework for data protection which includes guidelines for video surveillance. Further, it should be preceded by privacy impact assessments and followed up with post ante audits to review effectiveness.\nImportant Documents  Representation dated 24.01.2020 sent to WCD Ministry (link)  Don\u0026rsquo;t want our society to turn into an episode of Big Boss?

It\u0026rsquo;s been an annual tradition of sorts at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.\nIndia stands on the edge of a technological precipice In pure numbers something fascinating is happening where for the first time there are more internet connections than Indians. As per the the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India as of November, 2019 there are a total 661.27 million broadband subscribers (link) and as of September, 2019 for every 100 persons there exist 52 internet connections (link). These are large numbers but underscore the continued need to connect more people, especially in the rural parts of India to the internet. Without internet access for more Indians, a core facility for human existence, freedom and fulfilment will be denied to our fellow citizens.\nWhile we keep supporting the efforts to connect more people to the internet, IFF\u0026rsquo;s core mission is to maintain it\u0026rsquo;s quality and character. These beliefs and ideals were early on derived from the net neutrality campaign under the banner of SaveTheInternet.in that was initiated by several of IFF\u0026rsquo;s present and former co-founders. At that early moment in 2015, by encouraging civic participation through an online campaign, underscoring the public nature of the internet, safeguarding the choice and liberty of individual users – as well as express references to the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression, the campaign largely reflected constitutional values. This culture today carries on within our work as much as we introspect and commit to improve and be more effective.\nOptimism may be misplaced given the sharp divisions of political opinion and labels applied today more than ever before. One is almost reminded of the sharp wit of the M.R. Masani when the Objectives Resolution to our Constitution was being moved, he stated that, \u0026ldquo;We know that the French Revolution was made in the name of Fraternity but, towards the end of the Revolution a cynic remarked, ‘When I saw what men did in the name of fraternity, I faced my brother but resolved to call him cousin’”. But today is not a day to despair, it is for recommitting ourselves, in belief and practice to ensure that the core values of our constitution find place in our digital world.\nEach day is a call to action Over a year, IFF\u0026rsquo;s work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.\nTo cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression, privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each other more regularly than ever before.\nWe have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones, facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To accelerate timelines, one of IFF\u0026rsquo;s missions has to be to complement the power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.\nFinancial sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic legitimacy, discipline and transparency (transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020). We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.\nWe need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors. Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their products.\nToday, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to \u0026ldquo;secure\u0026rdquo; the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble. All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote and adopted, “I say that this Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty, from the people. That it has.”\nWe are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.\nIf you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to become a IFF Member today.\nApar Gupta, Executive Director\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/our-digital-republic/","summary":"A note from IFF to it\u0026rsquo;s broader community on the 71st Republic day.","title":"Notes from a Digital Republic"},{"content":"Tl;dr Yesterday, we explained the process of participation and sending views to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.

Read more about the case here. Senior Advocate, Ritin Rai and Advocate, Shreya Munoth appearing for IJU emphasized that news reports cannot be de-indexed without providing journalists an opportunity to defend their reportage. They further submitted there was a distinction between merely republishing defamatory allegations and reporting on them. They also highlighted the harm caused by de-indexing of news reports from Google search engine results by comparing it to removal of a book from the shelves of booksellers.\nPrivate lawsuits also affect press freedom At the beginning of the hearing, Endlaw J. noted that this was not a Public Interest Litigation and asked the counsels for IJU why they should be impleaded in a private defamation suit. In response, the counsels explained that private defamation suits can also violate the media\u0026rsquo;s freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and journalists’ right to carry on their profession under Article 19(1)(g). In support of this proposition, the counsels cited a recent decision of the German Constitutional Court where it was held that prior to directing de-indexing of any online content from search engine results, courts must consider the impact of such de-indexing on the freedom of speech and expression of the publisher even in disputes under private law.\nIs being de-indexed from Google really that big a deal? During the previous hearing, the Court had passed an interim injunction and directed Google to de-index URLs hosting defamatory content against the plaintiff from its search engine results. Since this was the scope of the interim relief granted, Endlaw J. asked the counsels whether de-indexing from Google search engine results is a problem if the articles are still available on the website of the news publication. In response to this, the counsels explained that Google was the most commonly used search engine and removal from its search results would make it very difficult for individuals to access the news reports. To highlight the importance of search engines, the counsels compared removing a news article from Google search results to removing a book from the shelves of booksellers.\nReportage =/= republication A large part of the hearing was devoted to discussing whether the press can have a better right than the person running the HerdandScene Instagram account to publish allegations against the plaintiff. Endlaw J. quizzed the counsels on whether republication of allegations which have been found to be prima facie defamatory by journalists is permissible. The counsels appearing for IJU clarified that there was a distinction between merely republishing allegations and reporting on them. They submitted that journalists have qualified privilege to report on the existence of allegations even if the allegation itself is unverified.\nOf “errors” and their inevitability The counsels for IJU drew the Court’s attention to various news articles whose removal has been sought by Subodh Gupta that either don’t refer to him at all or only reference his case briefly while making a broader point. To illustrate the problem, Mr. Rai cited this article by FirstPost about the Kochi Biennale dropping its inquiry into sexual harassment charges agains another artist, Riyaz Komu which was included in the list of defamatory articles submitted by Subodh Gupta. However, a bare perusal of the article reveals that the article doesn’t refer to Subodh Gupta at all. Subodh Gupta’s lawyers argued that this was an error but such overbroad and unnecessary censorship is inevitable because Subodh Gupta has not impleaded any of the media houses or journalists who could have defended the news reports and provided a counter viewpoint to the Court.\nNeed for anonymity in the art industry Senior Advocate, Jayna Kothari appeared on behalf of the Culture Workers Support Trust and argued in favour of the Trust’s impleadment since the defamation suit raised important questions of law about non-availability of formal greivance redressal mechanisms within the art world and the need to preserve anonymity in cases of sexual harassment where there is possibility of retaliation.\nThe plaintiff’s stance Senior Advocate, Sandeep Sethi appearing for Subodh Gupta stated that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 imposes bar on media reporting and argued that if journalists are not allowed to write about sexual harassment allegations even when a formal complaint is made, how can journalists be allowed to write about anonymous allegations made on social media. He insisted that his client’s right to due process, privacy and reputation had been seriously prejudiced by anonymous defamatory allegations. He stated that the content of the news reports was defamatory on the face of it, and even the journalists who had written these articles could not oppose their de-indexing because they had not complied with norms laid down by the Press Council of India.\nThe next date of hearing in the case is 4 February 2020 and the counsels for IJU and Culture Workers Support Trust will make their rejoinder arguments then.\nRoutine injunctions issued in SLAPP suits are threatening press freedom.

The Union Government envisions the digital economy as a trillion dollar opportunity by 2025 (link). These are big numbers. Such ambitious projections are often found on the basis of a robust growth in the number of internet connections in India. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) notes in it\u0026rsquo;s latest subscription report for November, 2019 for these to be close to 661 million (link).\nUsers of the internet are central to the story of how the digital economy in India is growing. Focussing on them, we have made 4 clear recommendations to the Ministry of Finance for the Union Budget 2020-21.\n These are first growing regulatory capacity in TRAI and the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY). While TRAI is considering Net Neutrality enforcement, MEITY should be adequately resourced for the institutional preparation of a Data Protection Authority. Second, we need an online and digital environment which is safe and secure for all of us. This can only be done by rationalizing the present budgetary allocations on cyber security which are principally earmarked to the Ministry of Home Affairs towards other bodies such as the Fin-Cert. Third, let us not waste money on illegal and unconstitutional surveillance programmes. While expenditures such as those on the Social Media Communication Hub or the NATGRID should not be made since they are illegal per se, for other programmes, funding should not be alloacated without a clear underlying law, a privacy compliant assessment and the necessary safeguards.

Quite often we make great laws, but their enforcement does not happen. The TRAI is finally trying to fix this on Net Neutrality. Despite having clear rules, we still do not have any enforcement mechanism. The first step in this is removing existing ambiguities, introducing a monitoring framework and then imposing penalties. The TRAI has taken a positive step towards fixing this by releasing a recent consultation paper. Read on for our summary and how you can participate!\nNet Neutrality demands action\n  Net neutrality has been a long enduring bond more than a million forged with the #SaveTheInternet.in campaign. Through it, they petitioned the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), a regulatory body which was instrumental in making rules and recommendations to protect the open internet. Quite simply, it protected user choices and ensured people like you were not left left to the mercy of large telecom companies who are Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\nThe Net Neutrality rules today prevent ISPs from choosing to charge you additionally or slow down your access to your favourite websites because their owners do not pay such ISPs extra money. In short, this is a massive win for internet users and the open internet. This has been a long time coming and we have documented this history in a separate explainer.\nHowever, despite clear rules that last came in September, 2018 to prohibit ISPs from both distorting traffic (slowing down your favourite online services) and in April, 2016 on pricing (charging you on the basis of websites you access), we still do not have any enforcement. This is why we had relaunched the SaveTheInternet.in in March, 2019 and petitioned TRAI and the nodal central government ministry, the Department of Telecom to begin monitoring for violations, create an enforcement framework and also to take interim action against website blocking.\nLet us help TRAI make a clear, citizen centric enforcement framework\n  TRAI on Jan 2, 2020 released a consultation paper titled as the, “Traffic Management Practices (TMPs) and Multi-Stakeholder Body for Net Neutrality.\u0026quot; The comments on it are due by Jan 30, 2020 and there is a further counter-comment period till Feb 13, 2020 (yes, just one day before Valentine’s day!). Comments should be sent to Sh. Asit Kadayan by email at advqos@trai.gov.in. So let us show our love for the internet by participating in this consultation.\nWe are especially enthused by TRAI\u0026rsquo;s clear statement which recognises the value of civil society and voices when it notes that, “Civil society organizations may also be the part of MSB as they engage in advocating the public’s rights and wishes of the people, including but not limited to health, environment and economic rights. They fulfil the important duties of checks and balances in democracies, they are able to influence the government and hold it accountable.”\nHow do you participate?

Today, we demonstrate how the absence of protection results in tangible damage. To do so, we have studied the case of Dissent Doe, a US based journalist who reports on data breaches. In August 2019, Dissent Doe had reported that counselling related data of 300,000 employees of 1to1Help’s corporate clients had been leaked due to a misconfigured Amazon Web Services bucket. Today, Dissent Doe is being sued by 1to1Help before the Bangalore City Civil Court. To usm this demonstrates a tangible need to not only change the National Cyber Security Policy but build legislative protections within the framework of the Personal Data Protection law.\nShooting the Messenger As the community of cyber security professionals increases in India, there are often questions on what processes they should follow for vulnerability and data breach disclosures. Even when done in good faith, such persons tread a dangerous path and face risk of legal prosecution. Today, we illustrate a routine case which demonstrates how an absence of clear positive protections in the law prevent security researchers from doing their work to keep users of technology safe in India.\nWe have taken the instance of Dissent Doe, who runs a journalistic and reporting portal at databreaches.net. On 1 August 2019, Dissent Doe had publicly disclosed that counselling related data of 300,000 employees of 1to1Help’s corporate clients had been leaked due to a misconfigured Amazon Web Services bucket. 1to1Help is an Indian company that provides counselling services to employees of prominent business corporations. As per Dissent Does\u0026rsquo;s statement, the exposed data was over five years old and it is unclear why 1to1Help continued retaining such old sensitive personal data in an unencrypted and insecure form (read more here).\nFurther, as per Dissent Doe, prior to making this public disclosure, they had reached out to 1to1Help multiple times and provided them an opportunity to secure the data and notify individuals whose personal data was compromised. Since 1to1Help did not respond to Dissent Doe’s initial emails, they reached out to some of 1to1Help’s corporate clients and informed them about the data breach without disclosing any personally identifiable details of employees whose data was included in the misconfigured bucket. According to Dissent Doe, on 6 August 2019, the Bangalore City Civil Court granted an ex parte interim injunction in favour of 1to1Help (Read more here).\nSuch litigation often emanates when security researchers, vulnerability testers and journalists make responsible disclosures. Today, there is a lack of proper legal protections, defined processes and a duty on entities that hold personal data to make pro-active disclosure. Citing concern, we are issuing a short statement and also calling for wider support through legal fixes which are urgently needed to safeguard the privacy and security of personal data of users and hold those who possess it accountable.\nBug Bounties, not Vexatious Lawsuits We are concerned with legal action against security researchers and journalists who make responsible disclosures of data breaches. To us, such prosecutions, which include several public instances including that of Dissent Doe, undermine the security of Indian internet users. Security researchers and journalists who report data breaches perform a vital function by exposing vulnerabilities that need fixing. Good faith vulnerability research and disclosure is necessary to limit the damage caused by a data breach and take corrective steps. Therefore, leading technology companies around the world provide recognition and rewards to security researchers who report vulnerabilities through bug bounty programmes.\nUnfortunately, as this article notes, despite rapidly digitizing its infrastructure, India still has a long way to go in recognizing the value of good faith vulnerability disclosure. Despite being a sizeable number, Indian security researchers are wary of reporting vulnerabilities because they fear being sued. Instead, security researchers based abroad tend to break these stories because they are safely outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts. This excessive reliance on foreign security researchers who have little accountability before the domestic legal system can have national security implications, and it is in our own interest to cultivate an indigenous security research community.\nIn India, security researchers are constantly at risk of legal action because Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 penalizes anyone who gains unauthorized access to a computer resource without permission of the owner, and it fails to draw a distinction between malicious hackers and ethical security researchers. Instances like Dissent Doe\u0026rsquo;s exemplify the urgent need for law reform in India. To promote good faith vulnerability disclosure, the Parliament must not only amend the Information Technology Act, 2000 but also look towards making suitable policy and regulatory frameworks within the field of data protection.\nThe present draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 falls short on this aspect because it only obligates data controllers to report data breaches to the Data Protection Authority and there is no requirement to notify the data subject whose personal data has been compromised. In contrast, the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 introduced by Dr. Ravi Kumar as a private member’s bill obligates the data controller to notify the data subject in addition to the relevant authorities.\nTill these legislative changes are made by the Parliament, we urge companies like 1to1Help to recognize the importance of vulnerability disclosure as a responsible business practice and work with security researchers instead of threatening them with legal action.\nImportant Documents:  Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 introduced by Dr. Ravi Kumar (link) Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 introduced by the Govt.

Many people have faced risks to their online and digital security. These same anxieties are present in securing our national cyber assets. Towards this, the government of India plans to release a Cybersecurity Strategy in 2020 and asked for inputs. We sent our comments on securing people like you. This recognises 5 important points that promote both security and human rights. Sounds, too good to be true? Read on!\nInstitutional security has to be individual centric We recently sent our comments to the National Security Council Secretariat which invited public comments for framing of the National Cyber Security Strategy 2020 (NCSS 2020). Our clear belief is that India requires to focus strongly on protecting its cyber assets and infrastructure. This has to be done in a manner in which we focus on creating an environment with the right incentives and grow a respect for individual privacy.\nMore tangibly as we outline in our submission to achieve this we make five distinct reccomendations.\n Recommendation 1: Independent vulnerability testers and cyber security specialists are strategic national assets – India’s innovative and expanding community of security researchers is a net asset, for cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors. There should be a clear policy and standard operating procedure devised for departments to be notified by security researchers without the threat of civil or criminal prosecution. Recommendation 2: Encryption protects India by protecting Indians – The use of encryption has far too often come under political attack by some parts of the security ecosystem. In fact, failure to encourage and expand the usage of encryption technologies puts individual users at risk. Here millions of Indians who today conduct their lives through digital tools are also entry point vulnerabilities unless their devices are secured through encryption. Recommendation 3: Encourage a strong data breach reporting mechanism in the Data Protection Act – Data breach reporting under a data protection legal framework is immensely useful for enhancing cybersecurity. Recommendation 4: Malware use makes all of insecure – We further recommend that the use of malware should be clearly prohibited. The collection of, “Zero-day” hacks or the proliferation in the use of technical exploits to hack into the devices and digital services of Indians makes the nation insecure. Recommendation 5: The open web is the secure web – Today, there are both economic forces and regulatory suggestions that threaten the decentralised framework of the internet. This undermines not only the stability of the public core but has a negative impact on cyber security in real and tangible ways.  We will keep advocating for the safety of India by advocating for the rights of users to use technologies that will secure thier devices. Our submission also benefits from the growing community of supporters and experts includes many from the domain cyber security and their work is incredibly advancing the national interest.\nIt is our earnest hope that the National Security Council Secretariat considers our submission for a cyber secure India that starts with securing Indians.\nImportant Documents  IFF\u0026rsquo;s Submission to India\u0026rsquo;s Cyber Security Policy (link)  We believe that security and human rights are natural allies.

Union of India is a step in the right direction but fails to provide immediate relief to Kashmiris who have already suffered immense hardship due to the 158 day communication shutdown. However, the judgement does provide strong legal footing to challenge the continued communication shutdown in Kashmir and arbitrary use of the Telecom Suspension Rules all over India. Most importantly, the judgement is only the first step and it will require continuous monitoring and follow up action to ensure the government complies with the progressive principles and procedural safeguards laid down by the Supreme Court.\nThe Good  Endorsement of the proportionality standard Drawing on past domestic and foreign jurisprudence, the Court has endorsed the proportionality standard to be the appropriate standard of review for communication shutdown orders. The judgement summarizes the proportionality test to require pursuit of a legitimate aim, exploration of suitable alternatives and adoption of the least restrictive measure. The nature of the restriction and its territorial and temporal scope will be relevant factors to determine whether it is proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved. Reading procedural safeguards into the Telecom Suspension RulesThe Court has read three procedural safeguards into the Telecom Suspension Rules to bring greater transparency and accountability in the telecom shutdown process. First, all telecom suspension orders must be made publicly available to make the Rules compliant with principles of natural justice. Second, orders must specify a time limit and they cannot suspend internet services indefinitely. Third, the Review Committee constituted under the Rules must review the orders every seven working days to determine their necessity. The Court has noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules have certain gaps but instead of striking them down as unconstitutional, the Court has read these procedural safeguards into the Rules to prevent arbitrary use of the Rules. Internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights but not a fundamental right itself The judgement states that expressing one’s views or conducting one’s business through the internet are protected under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution respectively. This means that online speech or online business activities can be restricted only on grounds recognized under Articles 19(2) and 19(6). This is relevant because the grounds under Article 19(6) are broader than Article 19(2) and includes reasonable restrictions imposed in “public interest.” Therefore, online speech will enjoy greater protection than online business activities. War on terror is not an excuse to ride roughshod over free speech The Court has recognized that even when the state is fighting the threat of terrorism, it can prohibit speech only if it is likely to lead to imminent violence. Government cannot refuse to supply orders citing logistical inconvenience The Court has held that the government must make all orders issued under S.144, Cr.P.C. and Telecom Suspension Rules available to petitioners. However, the government may refuse disclosure of orders if there is a “specific ground of privilege” or “countervailing public interest.” In these circumstances, the Court will have to determine whether the reasons cited by the government outweigh the petitioner’s right to receive copies of orders restricting fundamental rights. In the context of Kashmir, the Court has specifically held that the government’s claim that it was too difficult to produce multiple orders being issued and withdrawn on a day to day basis is not a valid reason to refuse disclosure of orders. Government cannot cite lack of technical ability as an excuseThe judgement categorically rejects the State’s claim that it needs to shut down the internet in its entirety because it does not have technical means to block access to specific websites and applications. Source of power to impose telecom suspensions has changed after 2017After making note of the Gujarat High Court decision in Gaurav Sureshbhai Vyas v. State of Gujarat which allowed internet shutdowns to be imposed under S.144, Cr.P.C., the Supreme Court has stated that the position of law has changed after notification of the Telecom Suspension Rules in 2017. This could be reasonably construed as an implicit finding that telecom suspension orders can no longer be issued under S.144, Cr.P.C.  The Bad  No direction for restoration of communication services in Kashmir The Court has not declared the 158 day communication shutdown as unconstitutional or directed the government to restore all telecom services in Kashmir. As on date, internet services and voice calls on prepaid numbers continue to remain suspended in Kashmir. The judgement states that it could not determine the constitutionality of the communication shutdown because the State had not produced all orders. The State\u0026rsquo;s refusal to produce orders citing logistical inference was clearly held to be untenable but despite this, the Court has allowed the State to get away with frustrating the fundamental right to judicial review by unjustifiably witholding orders. Only prospective review by the executive, no retrospective review by the judiciaryThe Court has laid down abstract guiding principles and left it to the executive to decide the necessity and proportionality of continuing the communication shutdown and movement restrictions in Kashmir. This means that there will be no determination of the constitutionality of the communication shutdown and movement restrictions from 5 August 2019 to 10 January 2020 by the judiciary. Even the executive is only required to prospectively review its imposition of restrictions on telecom services, and there is no obligation on the executive to review its actions between 5 August 2019 to 10 January 2020. The Court’s refusal to retrospectively review the 158 day long communication shutdown has left Kashmiris who have already suffered psychological distress and financial losses running into thousands of crores without any relief or remedy. Reasonable restriction can also mean complete prohibition The Court has held that reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) can extend to complete prohibition of speech in certain circumstances. This counterintuitive holding sets a problematic precedent and it could undermine future legal challenges to the Telecom Suspension Rules on the ground of internet shutdowns being inherently indiscriminate and overbroad in nature. Misapplication of the doctrine of chilling effectIn this case, there was direct interference with journalistic activities because journalists belonging to Kashmir Times could not contact their sources and editors and their movement was being arbitrarily blocked by paramilitary forces. All these specific facts were pleaded by the petitioner in her writ petition and additional affidavit. Despite these facts being on record, the Court has mischaracterized this type of direct impingement on press freedom as a complaint of indirect chilling effect on the press’s functioning. The direct and inevitable consequence of disabling telecom services and physically stopping journalists from entering certain areas is violation of press freedom and it cannot be characterized solely as a chilling effect.  IFF\u0026rsquo;s Statement The judgement in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India provides a sound legal basis to challenge future communication shutdowns but it does little to address the harm already caused to Kashmiris in the last 158 days. The Court has rejected several extreme arguments made by the government regarding secrecy of orders and national security, and the principles and safeguards laid down in this case are the first step in reforming the telecom suspension process in India. This judgement is a call to action in a lot of ways and it marks the beginning of a long uphill campaign. There needs to be disciplined and strategic follow up action to ensure it is implemented by the government in its true spirit in Kashmir and other states. To this end, IFF will be taking the following steps in the coming weeks:\n Write to the government urging it to review the functioning of the Telecom Suspension Rules and conduct a public consultation since the Supreme Court has also noted that the Rules have gaps and need amendment. File regular RTIs to check if telecom suspension orders are being proactively published and periodically reviewed in accordance with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions. Work with local petitioners if the government fails to review the orders for Kashmir within one week and support them in moving to courts to seek compliance with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions.

This committee was formed barely a month back, and given the short timelines, absence of a notice inviting comments and year end holidays, we requested it to invite further feedback. Given that the issue of porn and its impact on minors is incredibly contested, we also impressed on the need to support further study, clearly define the harms being examined and finally to consider a review of the victorian era laws on obscenity.\nListen, we need to talk. We think the time is ripe to have a conversation on this important yet knotty issue of the legality of pornography and its impact as it is deliberated by a parliamentary committee.\n About the committee: This committee was constituted in the Rajya Sabha on December 12, 2019 titled as, “Committee to study the alarming issue of pornography on social media and its effect on children and society as a whole.” It is working with an extremely short timeline to submit its report within a month (read more here). This means by January 12, 2019! To the best of our knowledge, it did not invite public comments. Even then, we have offered pro-active submissions to the committee members asking them to invite further inputs and stakeholders. Since our submissions are not pursuant to any notice, they may not constitute formal evidence, and hence, they are not bound by the rules of parliamentary privilege that apply to evidence tendered to standing committees under notices. In light of this, we are making a copy of the submissions publicly available. Bring more experts to the table: We highlighted the need for medium to long-term, interdisciplinary studies as studies conducted in several forigen jurisdictions are repeatedly indicating conflicting results and outcomes. The Committee should particularly invite comments and expert testimony from individuals and organizations specializing in feminist thought, LGBTQIA+ rights and freedom of speech who have closely studied the regulation of pornography and obscenity in India. In this respect, our primary request at present is to extend the deadline to undertake serious and considered study.  Our substantive submission: Reform obscenity laws. Punish image based sexual abuse. We have held a consistent and clear position on pornography that draws from our understanding of our fundamental right to freedom of expression. Adult desire that recognises autonomy and consent is the framework of stable, healthy societies that eschew repression. This has been a constant thread running through our RTI work around the porn blocks or how ISPs in India were illegally blocking porn.\nWhile porn is problematic for a multitude of reasons including lack of media diversity and lack of labour protections, the principal regulation in India for it originates from victorian sensibilities. This is toxic as it often undermines the rights of autonomy, consent and sexuality. It criminalises healthy adult behaviours and represses desire.

This is an act of mass surveillance and is completely illegal. We wrote to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Commissioner of Police, Delhi demanding a complete halt and recall of the AFRS. Our legal notice sets out its illegality in detail.\nIt starts with low success rate in locating missing children In 2017 a petition came to be filed in the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court of Delhi docketed as Sadhan Haldar v The State NCT of Delhi [WP(Crl) 1560/2017] for locating and then reuniting missing children with their families. This is an incredibly positive aim which we can all support. Here seems that the Delhi Police and other public authorities were not being able to achieve success. In such a situation they turned to the promises offered by facial recognition technology.\nThe software for the facial recognition system as per the Indian Express report was sourced from M/s Innefu Labs Private Limited which claims on its website offers various law enforcement solutions. These include capabilities for “a 360 degree monitoring, AI driven predictive intelligence solution” titled as, “Prophecy”. We shudder at the thought that this is a vendor to the Delhi Police.\n  \u0026ldquo;Screengrab from Innefu System\u0026rsquo;s Website\u0026rdquo;\n  However, this that did not lead to much success with at least three orders of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court recording it\u0026rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the facial recognition system as late as August 23, 2019. We already know such technologies are highly unreliable and scarce state resources should be used cautiously only after feasibility and rights based assessments. Stepping back, since even this High Court case contains no clear direction for the use of facial recognition software, even for instances of locating missing children a question arises, \u0026ldquo;What is the legal authority under which this facial recognition system is being implemented?\u0026rdquo;.\nDelhi Police must immediately halt mass surveillance The facial recognition system being used in Delhi as per the Indian Express report is disturbing. We have sourced further public materials, which though limited confirm the basis of the report. All of these clearly point to multiple illegalities and harms. From building an underlying database of people from public protests to running it on crowds of people attending rallies. This directly impairs the rights of ordinary Indians from assembly, speech and political participation.\nThe present facial recognition deployments cause harms that even go further. Due to the high inaccuracy rates coupled with the use of law enforcement it throws up risks of bias that have have a high probability in causing coercive action. These are all harms which stem from a scant regard to the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s nine-judge bench judgement in case of KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) that reaffirmed the fundamental right to privacy.\nConcerned by this we put the Delhi Police to notice. The notice is extremely detailed and sets out the factual nuances and the several illegalities of the deployment. We are committed to taking further actions and are thankful to researchers such as Vidushi Marda and Srinivas Kodali for helping us provide inputs. We cannot win the fight against surveillance alone. All of us need to work together. A google doc version has been made available at the bottom of the page specifically to help you to craft similar notices or consider advocacy actions.\nFurther actions to safeguard you from facial recognition We intend to focus our energies in 2020 on areas of surveillance as a priority. This includes pushing back against facial recognition not only in Delhi but across several cities in India. It builds off our past efforts including our legal notice to the NCRB\u0026rsquo;s procurement of a national facial recognition system (read more here). From the early days of January we will work actively to ensure that India\u0026rsquo;s data protection law contains surveillance reforms.\nThis will continue our model framework as proposed under #SaveOurPrivacy that has been used twice by Member\u0026rsquo;s of Parliament to file private members bills.

Quite often these are deployed across peaceful protests to record the movements of people and pose a risk to their privacy. They also may fly close to crowds threatening injury and causing anxiety. These concerns made us look more closely as to their legal framework and to our shock we discovered that these are completely illegal. We wrote to the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation urging for urgent action.\nLegality of Drones Last year India has come up with an ambitious regulatory system for remotely piloted aircraft systems (“drones”). This was done under provisions of the the Aircraft Act, 1934 and Aircraft Rules, 1937. Under this legal framework the the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has been vested with exclusive powers to regulate the use and operation of drones (read more here).\nBroadly under it, all such drones have to first be under specific makes and models which have been permitted by the DGCA. Secondly, they have to be registered as per the regulatory system. As per an answer provided by the Hon’ble Minister of State for Civil Aviation dated December 12, 2019 in the Lok Sabha there are only six micro and small drones legally approved by the DGCA. To our shock and surprise this is being flouted by police departments across India.\nViolations a plenty Yesterday during one of the protests in Delhi one such violation was brought to our notice making us write an urgent letter to the DGCA in the evening.\n Fundamental right to privacy: These violations are in the nature of the use of the drone which is firstly deployed with a camera by the Delhi Police. To our preliminary analysis this would ordinarily conflict with the constitutional right to privacy as laid down by the Supreme Court. It is important to consider that the privacy right under the judgement applies even in public spaces. Such acts of mass surveillance need to be done only on the basis of legality, necessity and proportionality. Violation of DGCA Rules: Second and more worryingly it seems that the use of such drones is beyond the permitted categories, makes and models as permitted by the DGCA. Notably, the Delhi police has been found to be using drones manufactured by DJI systems (specifically DJI Phantom) which are beyond these permitted categories as per the Reply to Question No. 356 as referred above.  Based on these violations we swung into action and have written to the DGCA. We demand for a cease to the use of drones by police departments, an independent legal opinion and their subsequent confiscation. We are thankful to Srinivas Kodali for helping us provide inputs and prompting us to take rapid action.\nEven more broadly, this again underscores why a comprehensive data protection law with surveillance reforms is an urgent need for India today. Unfortunately the existing draft data protection has wide exemptions and poorly protects you. We have a better model over at #SaveOurPrivacy which has been used twice by Member\u0026rsquo;s of Parliament to file private members bills.\nImportant Documents  Notice to the DGCA dated Decemeber 27, 2019 (link) Reply to Starred Question No. 356 in the Lok Sabha dated December 12, 2019 (link) Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) issued on August 27, 2018 governing remotely piloted aircraft systems (link)  Sky rockets in flight, afternoon frights?

We just submitted our counter comments on the paper and thankfully a lot of other groups agree with our stance that this sector does not need more regulation!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s raining, no it\u0026rsquo;s pouring, over-regulation If you were a little busy this beginning holiday season and missed our post how the TRAI intends to regulate cloud service provider, you can read all about it in our previous post here. Coming back to TRAI’s worrying decision; as part of our counter comments, as always we created a tabular chart of vital submissions made by each group that responded to the consultation paper and of-course provided further comments to each of them.\nThis 40-something document is definitely a task to go through but while we urge you to read up on the submissions (some of them are really interesting), we’ve got you covered on the most important snippets - yes, it is a breakdown of who is for the paper’s main suggestion (of regulating cloud service providers) and who is against.\nIn favour\n _Cloud Computing Innovation Council of India_The CCICI has broadly shown support toward the paper, however, it disagrees on a few nitty-gritties such as the type of category based on which a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) should be registered. _Consumer Care Society and Consumer Protection Association_Both these consumer based bodies have indicated that CSPs be regulated with specific suggestions in response to the paper’s questions on how do so as well. Not keeping in mind the consumers too much eh? _PayMate, Reliance Jio, Tata Teleservices_Unsurprisingly, Reliance and Tata (the telecom based groups) have advocated for the regulation of CSPs and although they disagree on the need for the creation of single or multiple bodies, they have both maintained that it important to avoid confusion and conflicting agendas. PayMate on the other hand has demonstrated partial support to the extent that it has emphasised on only the need for self-regulation by the industry.  Against\nOut of the 21 submission made, a majority has been against the idea of regulation of CSPs.

In its current form, the RPP Bill is plagued by definitional confusion and lack of a clearly stated purpose. The RPP Bill neither contains a clear definition of “news on digital media” nor does it indicate the objectives sought to be achieved by identifying and regulating digital news media. Digital news media is still in nascent stages of development in India and it must not be brought within the ambit of the RPP Bill to merely achieve regulatory parity with print media. We urge the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to start from a clean slate by publishing a whitepaper and conducting public consultation before drafting any regulatory legislation.\nDefinitional Confusion The government has invited suggestions on the Registration of Press and Periodicals Bill, 2019 (‘RPP Bill’) which seeks to replace the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 (‘PRB Act’). According to the notice on the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s website, one of the main features of the RPP Bill is that it creates “a simple system of registration of e-papers.” However, the Bill does not contain a clear definition of “e-papers.”\nSection 2(k) of the RPP Bill defines **** “news on digital media” as “news in digitized format that can be transmitted over the internet, computer or mobile networks and includes text, audio, video and graphics.” This definition is overbroad, and it includes posts made by individuals on social media platforms and blogs within its ambit. Including such posts within the ambit of the RPP Bill and imposing a registration requirement on social media users and bloggers is excessive, and it would constitute an arbitrary, unnecessary and disproportionate encroachment on freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\nFurther, in its current form, the RPP Bill fails to clarify whether “news on digital media” is limited to news organizations which publish news in an electronic format in addition to printed periodicals or if it extends to news organizations which solely publish news in an electronic format such as standalone news websites.\nThe reasons for including news published in an electronic format within the ambit of the RPP Bill must be clearly stated, and the same must not be done to merely achieve regulatory parity with print media. Standalone news websites particularly are at a nascent stage of development in India, and by reducing the amount of capital investment required to publish news, they have democratized the news industry and increased independence and diversity in journalism. Imposing cumbersome obligations on these standalone news websites would increase the cost of compliance and create entry barriers in the news industry.\nGotta Start from Scratch The stated objective of the PRB Act was preservation of copies of books and periodicals containing news printed in India. While this may have been necessary in 1867 when the PRB Act was originally enacted, the law has outlived its archival utility in the modern digital age with the internet maintaining a record of news and current affairs. Therefore, there is a need to fundamentally re-examine the purpose and scope of the RPP Bill which seeks to replace the PRB Act.\nThe Ministry should first publish a whitepaper that identifies existing problems in the news industry and suggests suitable solutions to them. The whitepaper should be made available to the public and comments should be sought from stakeholders about the proposed solutions. Adopting such a process would ensure that the resulting legislation strikes an appropriate balance between the objectives sought to be achieved through regulation of the news and the press’s freedom of speech and expression and the public’s right to receive information.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s Comments on the Registration of Press and Periodicals Bill, 2019 (link) Registration of Press and Periodicals Bill, 2019 (link)  Don’t want to register your blog with the government?

In the midst of worries of the creation of a separate Committee to avoid the supposed composition of the current Parliamentary Committee on Information Technology, we thought it would be best to write to the Joint Parliamentary Committee with a few suggestions on upholding the democratic spirit of this country.\nHigh Hopes In continuation with IFF\u0026rsquo;s practice to ensure transparency and accountability from the bodies we engage with, our representation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee asks for just that. The current atmosphere in India brings to the forefront more now than ever, that the voices of its people be heard; that its people be included; that it be run by its people.\nEvery ask revolves around this exact theme; here are the suggestions we put forth:\n Further civic participation: To ensure that the public be given the opportunity to provide their comments on the Bill, we ask that the Committee undertake a public consultation. But that\u0026rsquo;s not it, we also asked that these responses be pro-actively circulated with all members of the committee and made public if possible. Maintain inclusivity through indic language versions: __ Citing the good precedent set by changes to the language requirements established by the National Education Policy Draft, we stressed that the Committee ensure that the Bill be made available in various regional languages. Make materials public: In addition to the comments and counter comments being made public, we suggested two additional materials which may benefit from publication when the report of the committee is tabled in parliament. Therefore, we asked that the minutes of Committee\u0026rsquo;s meetings and any responses made by government ministries and papers which are circulated for the members, be made public. It\u0026rsquo;d just give us an all round understanding of the Bill, don\u0026rsquo;t you think? Public depositions: In continuing with the positive precedent set by various other committees, we thought this Committee should follow suit so made sure to request that academics, civil society representatives and technologists who can aid in strengthening the provisions of the Bill in favour of the Indian citizens, be invited to depose before it.

The arrival of such a Bill is definitely needed, however, those terrible parts we were concerned about still haven\u0026rsquo;t undergone much change and now a few more terrible parts have been added. Just to bring you up to speed, we\u0026rsquo;ve listed five areas that are pretty concerning. Want to go into some more detail? We will soon put out detailed explanations but till then we\u0026rsquo;ve added a bunch of links of various other places that have dissected the Bill.\n5 issues to watch out in the Data Protection Bill On December 4, 2019, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 was finally approved by the Cabinet. However, as has been the case throughout this year, the current form of the Bill was unknown until December 10, 2019. The Bill was circulated amongst Members of Parliament and of course everyone managed to grab themselves a copy. The Bill made its first public appearance in 2018 but was the subject of much deliberation by the Government ever since and had been rumoured to have undergone substantial additions over this period of time.\nAs we presently possess the Bill in all its supposed glory, the disappointment we feel is ofcourse much less glorious. A large portion of the concerns we had with the Bill still remain and continue to occupy a significant need that India’s data protection law should ideally fulfil. We list out five of our major worries, some of which will refresh your memories of the previous Bill but also provide titbits of how new provisions only adds to these concerns.\nIssue 1: Super broad exemptions\n Exemptions: The 2018 Bill provided the State with leeway to obtaining consent for certain aspects such as for the provision of services/benefits and for the issuing of licences, certificates or permits. This has received a further seal of approval with this 2019 Bill clearly stating that consent is not required by the State which can exempt any government department by an order. Now imagine the Data Protection Bill being made inapplicable to the UIDAI which holds all our Aadhaar data? Does that make sense? Therefore, the State continues to maintain the same massive control over an individual’s personal data and we continue to fear the extent to which it might be pushed.  Issue 2: Muddled priorities\n Preamble: While the Bill\u0026rsquo;s preamble resembles a rights respecting data protection law, a closer look shows its true intentions to benefit from the use of this data. This confused approach in which data protection of individuals is placed on the same level as promoting business and governance interests is not the proper role of a data protection legislation. Such a law is to protect individual people like, you, and me, not promote bussiness or ensure better governance for which other independent policies can be formed. This results in confusion and muddled thinking which reflects in several contradictory provisions in the bill. The Govt wants all the data: The new Bill introduces a provision that exempts processing of anonymised data or broadly \u0026lsquo;non-personal data\u0026rsquo;. This provision also allows the Government to direct Data Fiduciaries to provide such data. Why? Oh, because it wants to promote for framing of digital policies. Every time we ask what is, \u0026ldquo;non-personal\u0026rdquo; data we are given the example of traffic data from Uber or Ola which can be shared for road design and real time traffic management. But surely we cannot approach and build such a broad exemption based of one use case. Can we? Sandbox provisions: The new bill creates what has been widely considered as a \u0026lsquo;sandbox\u0026rsquo; provision; while it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been defined, the provision aims to encourage innovation in AI, Machine-Learning or other developing technology so it provides Data Fiduciaries with the option to fall within the Sandbox provision in order for it to retain data collected by it for 3 years. This ability to, \u0026ldquo;play around with personal data to build businesses\u0026rdquo; is done without consent. To us this is really concerning!  Issue 3: Legitimising unregulated surveillance\n New additions: While the bill does nothing to address surveillance reforms, it makes a bad situation even worse. Now this is something we’ve been harping about for ages; neither did the previous Bill or the redraft make an attempt to address the very real threat of surveillance India is currently facing. Instead what does the 2019 Bill do? It weakened already existing safeguards that were even slightly applicable to surveillance through additional exemptions. A deeper well: Earlier in order for law enforcement agencies to collect and process data, it needed to be necessary and proportionate to its interest in the data. However, with Section 35 and 36(a) of the new Bill, it now excludes these law enforcement agencies from the application of the Bill. This is for data which is gathered with consent by users whose data now can be easily requisitioned by Government offices in real time. Why? Because the Data Protection Bill will not apply to them.  Issue 4: The Sarkaari Data Protection Authority (DPA)\n No changes: **** We bring this up because the previous Bill was pretty worrying but without a doubt the new Bill found a way to make it worse. The new Bill maintains the composition of the DPA (considered the regulator) which essentially appears to be under the absolute control of the Central Government as it lacks diverse representation. No good additions: This control is now accentuated as a Selection Committee that selects the Chairperson (known as the Selection Committee) and the members of the DPA have been replaced by individuals of the Executive as opposed to the earlier Bill, where they were members of the judiciary were part of the Selection Committee.  Issue 5: \u0026ldquo;Voluntary\u0026rdquo; Social Media Verification\n Everyone gets a blue tick: This entirely fresh provision creates a whole new class of data fiduciaries called social media intermediaries. This requires these intermediaries to provide users with the option of getting verified voluntarily. While this is being done in an attempt to battle disinformation and fake news, which is frequently spread by pseudonymous or fake accounts, there is no clarity as to how this verification intends to crub misinformation. What\u0026rsquo;s dangerous about it? We all know how social media companies thrive on retaining our attention and then make money by profiling and selling our personal data. With legal backing to demand our Aadhaar or any other government ID to be linked to social media they will be able to gather greater information about us. In many ways this will lead to greater and more accurate survelliance and profiling. This directly conflicts with the rule of data minimisation. It goes against Data Protection.  Read what others have to say While we bring to the surface these major issues, a plethora of new problems have propped up since the Bill was made public. A few other places like slfc.in and mozilla have listed some of the changes that have been made (Click on the links to read what they\u0026rsquo;ve said). But that’s not all of our worries, not only was the Bill introduced in Parliament on December 11, 2019 but it has now been referred, NOT to the existing Standing Committee on Information Technology but to a newly formed Joint Select Committee.\nTo understand why we\u0026rsquo;re this worried, you might want to take a look at these private member\u0026rsquo;s Bills based on SaveOurPrivacy\u0026rsquo;s 7 Privacy Principles that provide a semblance of what a Data Protection law should be. Here is the Bill by Dr. Shashi Tharoor (link) and a recent one by Dr. Ravikumar (link).\nOur continued actions We intend to do a detailed analysis of these five issues and other linked concerns over the next week; we\u0026rsquo;ve decided to combine our explainers with an added element in an attempt to keep in real/interesting.

Internet disruptions are an issue of immense concern and threatens individual rights as well the social goals articulated by the government policy of Digital India.\nThis becomes more important at the time of such protests for two reasons. First, it enables messages of calm and peace to be broadcast through social media. This is being done regularly and constantly by protest organisers, civil society organisations, intellectuals and political leaders. Even Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi has used digital means to issue statements on the need for peace and unity are possible as internet remains accessible. Second, press reports indicate large scale police excesses toward peaceful protests and the ability to access internet services is vital during these moments of unrest; it enables the transparent documentation of events and also creates a level of accountability and restraint in policing responses. We urge your office to consider that due to the large number, frequency and regions undergoing internet shutdowns India today leads the world in internet shutdowns.

In September 2018, the satirical website was blocked by our outrage driven government machinery after a prominent politician demanded its blocking on Twitter. The blocking was in complete contravention of statutorily prescribed procedure and there was no notice or hearing granted to the website’s creator, Tanul Thakur. When Tanul tried to get a copy of the blocking order by filing an RTI application, MeitY refused to even provide that by citing the confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the Blocking Rules.

The government has been granted four weeks to file its reply and the next date of hearing in the case is 2 March 2020.\nThe writ petition challenges the blocking of Dowry Calculator on both procedural and substantive grounds. First, the petition highlights that Tanul was not provided any notice or hearing prior to blocking of the website despite it being a mandatory requirement under the Blocking Rules. Second, the petition emphasizes that satirical speech is protected by the Constitution and the government’s claim that Dowry Calculator could lead to incitement of a cognizable offence relating to public order is preposterous.\nIn addition to seeking unblocking of Dowry Calculator, the petition also seeks a judicial declaration that Rule 16 of the Blocking Rules which imposes a confidentiality requirement is unconstitutional in so far as it applies to owners, creators, developers and curators of the blocked content. Rule 16 was earlier cited by MeitY to decline Tanul’s RTI request for a copy of the blocking order. If Rule 16 is partially struck down by the Delhi High Court, it would bring greater transparency in the website blocking process and make it easier for website creators to challenge blocking orders in court.\nStraight from the horse’s mouth Here is what Tanul Thakur, the creator of Dowry Calculator, has to say about what motivated him to seek legal redress.\n “Last year, sometime in September, I found out that my website, DowryCalculator, was banned by the Department of Telecommunication. That information came through an unlikely source: a tweet. I got no notification of the ban — or the reason(s) for it — from the government. It felt both confusing and baffling, not to say quite unfair as well. I also wondered about the written contract between the state and the citizen — enshrined in the Constitution through Article 19(1)(a), guaranteeing the freedom of speech and expression to an Indian national — which, I felt, had been violated.\n  DowryCalculator does not promote dowry. The website had been around for more than 7 years, covered in Indian and international media, and a large majority of its users were quick to notice that it was a satire: an attempt to punch up. The website was an attempt at subversion, to show what avaricious Indian grooms really are: a commodity. Over the course of next year, I followed the due process — filed multiple RTIs to get the government’s response — to get some clarity on the abrupt, knee-jerk reaction, but got, at best, only evasive answers. The next best option, unfortunately, was to approach the court, to reclaim my fundamental right as the citizen of a democratic nation.”\n IFF has been helping Tanul since May 2019 with drafting and filing RTI applications and we also assisted with the writ petition. The petition was drafted by Abhinav Sekhri and Vrinda Bhandari, and Siddharth Aggarwal generously agreed to appear on behalf of the petitioner for the oral hearing.

We noted with concern how while it may be most severely impacted, the scope of this problem is much larger and felt nationally. Subsequently, we coordinated legal teams and organised challenges by two press bodies, the Foundation for Media Professionals and the Indian Journalists Union (click here) in the Supreme Court against the communication blockade.\nIn an increasingly digital society, an internet shutdown is a shutdown of essential facilities and conveniences such as online banking, ride hailing services, e-commerce platforms etc. It impacts young students, working professionals, freelancers, small and medium business owners and even senior citizens who today rely on it to reach their loved ones and for information gathering to keep themselves safe.\nToday, we note with concern that internet shutdowns are in place in the States of Assam and Tripura. At the same time, the communication shutdown continues in Kashmir with pre-paid phone connections and internet remaining suspended. We have discovered through RTI responses from the State Government of Rajasthan (click here) and Bihar (click here) that the internet has been frequently suspended in those states too. While we had filed similar RTIs with all other State Governments, most of them refused to provide information to us. Such lack of transparency is worrying and these concerns have been echoed even in courts and Parliament. The available orders suggest that internet access is often suspended by unauthorized government officials in a casual manner without adequate application of mind.\nAs to consistent objections which are made on the grounds of such internet shutdowns being precautionary measures to save lives, the evidence so far is inconclusive. As noted in a recent India specific empirical study by Jan Rydzak from Stanford’s Global Digital Policy Incubator, “findings imply that information blackouts compel participants in collective action in India to substitute non-violent tactics for violent ones that are less reliant on effective communication and coordination. While they may sometimes disrupt structured and non-violent protest, this effect is highly inconsistent” (click here). Hence, while the benefits are uncertain, the harm to free speech and the ability of people to conduct their lives digitally is certain.\nWe urge the Central Government to consider issuing an advisory on the frequent use of these internet disruptions which are today not only imperilling the ambitious goals of the Digital India programme but are causing incredible hardship to millions across India. We commit to our community and supporters that we will continue to take strategic action to contest internet shutdowns.

Besides Bihar, Rajasthan is the second state to provide us access to internet shutdown orders. Our analysis of the orders reveals that these orders have been issued by Divisional Commissioners who lack authority to suspend telecom services and many orders were issued in circumstances which do not seem to satisfy the public emergency/public safety requirement under the law.\nPublic Emergency or Public Safety: The Two Prerequisites Suspension of telecom services, that includes within its ambit shutting down of mobile internet and broadband internet services, is carried out under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, on the “occurrence of public emergency or in the interest of public safety”. The power to suspend telecom services on these grounds can be traced back to section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. The question then arises is what constitutes “public emergency” or “public safety” in the context of the Telegraph Act?\nThe meaning of these terms was first explained by the Supreme Court in Hukam Chand v Union of India (1975) and reiterated in PUCL v. Union of India (1997). In Hukam Chand, the Supreme court observed that the occurrence of a \u0026ldquo;public emergency\u0026rdquo; is sine qua non for the exercise of powers under Section 5(2), and the competent authority must record its satisfaction as to the existence of such an emergency. Further, an emergency must be a “public emergency” and not any other kind of emergency. In Hukum Chand, certain telephones in a hotel in Delhi were being used to facilitate illegal forward trading. The Administrator of Delhi authorised the police to take temporary possession of the telephones on the ground that “public emergency” exists. However, the Supreme Court did not accept that this constitutes a “public emergency”. Affirming the view adopted in Hukam Chand, the Supreme Court further elaborated the meaning of “public emergency\u0026quot; in PUCL as the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the people at large calling for immediate action. The expression \u0026ldquo;public safety\u0026rdquo; was defined as the state or condition of freedom from danger or risk for the people at large.\nTherefore, the Supreme Court decisions in Hukum Chand and PUCL make it clear that the conditions or the state of affairs which can be considered a public emergency or in the interest of public safety must affect the community at large, and every disturbance of law and order does not satisfy the public emergency/public safety threshold under Section 5(2).\nAnalysis of Internet Shutdown Orders from Rajasthan (i) Impermissible sub-delegation of powers\nState action which infringes fundamental rights must conform to the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India (2017 \u0026amp; 2019). The first prong of the proportionality standard requires that the restriction on fundamental rights must be prescribed by law. **** The most glaring error in the internet shutdown orders from Rajasthan is the sheer disregard for statutory rules that require telecom suspension orders to be issued by the Secretary, Home Department in the case of the State Government, or in unavoidable circumstances, by an officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary.\nNone of the internet shutdown orders supplied to us have been issued by the competent authority under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. All orders have been issued by Divisional Commissioners. On 2 Sep 2017, the Rajasthan Government had delegated the powers conferred upon the State Home Secretary under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to Divisional Commissioners. On 28 September 2018, the Department of Telecommunications of the Central Government had warned the Rajasthan Government against delegating these powers to Divisional Commissioners and stated that the Rajasthan Government should reconsider its decision to delegate these powers to Divisional Commissioners and ensure that the Rules are followed strictly. Despite this, there are several orders issued by Divisional Commissioners in 2019 suspending telecom services including in the wake of the recent Ayodhya judgement.\n(ii) Shutting down criticism of the government by shutting down the internet\nIn a constitutional democracy, arbitrary and disproportionate restrictions cannot be placed on the fundamental right to peaceful protest. The internet has transformed the way people organise and agitate against unjust government action. The Arab Spring is a real life example of how the internet and social media have revolutionised the tactics and methodology of collective protest. In Rajasthan, there have been several instances of Divisional Commissioners imposing internet shutdowns based on mere apprehension of protest or agitation against the government.\nFor example, on 2 July 2019, the Jaipur Divisional Commissioner issued an order to suspend mobile internet services and social media platforms citing law and order concerns because protestors were demanding the arrest of an alleged sex offendor and compensation for the minor victim. Similarly, in Sikar District when a bandh was called to criticize the conduct of the police in an abduction case, internet services were suspended for 38 hours vaguely citing apprehensions about circulation of rumours.\nSuspension of internet services in these cases was a clear attempt to prevent any agitation or protest against the conduct of the police. In light of the proportionality standard, state action must pursue a legitimate aim. Shutting down the internet to prevent criticism of government officials does not constitute a legitimate aim and such misuse of telecom suspension powers goes against the very idea of a State which respects the citizen’s right to peaceful protest.\nFurther, empirical studies have shown that telecom shutdowns may actually be counterproductive. In a study titled ‘Of Blackouts and Bandhs: The Strategy and Structure of Disconnected Protest in India’, researchers at Stanford University conducted a statistical analysis of network shutdowns in India in 2016 and found that network shutdowns incentivize those forms of violent collective action which tend to be more chaotic and require less communication, coordination and preparation than peaceful demonstrations.\n(iii) Telecom shutdowns should be the absolute last resort\nIn accordance with the proportionality standard, internet shutdowns are permissible only if the intended objective cannot be achieved through less restrictive alternatives. In July and August 2018, Divisional Commissioners in Rajasthan had suspended mobile internet to prevent the use of unfair means in public service examinations for the recruitment of police constables. Prevention of unfair means in examinations does not amount to a “public emergency” that would impact the community at large by any stretch of the imagination. Similarly, in Sikar district, the Divisional Commissioner suspended access to mobile internet and social media platforms to foil the plans of a few criminals who were hiding and were in contact through WhatsApp. Issuing telecom suspension orders in these circumstances demonstrates complete lack of application of mind since the objectives could have been achieved through less restrictive measurea like the use of signal jammers in the exam halls or targetted blocking of phone numbers of criminals.\nInternet facilitates speech and much more The government, while exercising its power under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, should balance the impact of internet shutdowns on fundamental rights of citizens with the need to prevent a public emergency or protect public safety. In PUCL v Union of India (2013), the Supreme Court has held that fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution also include ancillary guarantees which make exercise of those rights meaningful and possible. Widespread and indiscriminate suspension of telecom services can have devastating human, social and economic consequences. In Digital India, access to the internet is an indispensable requirement for access to various other rights such as healthcare, education, livelihood etc. This fantastic report by Asmita Bakshi from the Mint spells out the human cost of internet shutdowns in Rajasthan which deprive Uber drivers of their daily earnings, prevent diagnostic centres from functioning effectively and deny students the opportunity to register for exams. As the use of the internet becomes increasingly impossible to extricate from our day to day activities, there is an urgent need to reconsider and reform a legal regime that allows arbitrary and disproportionate use of technological kill switches.\n(This post has been authored by Yaqoob Alam, a legal intern at IFF, and edited by IFF staffer, Devdutta.)\nImportant Documents  Internet shutdown orders received from Rajasthan Government (link) DoT Letter to Rajasthan Government (link)  Technological kill switches and trigger happy government officials are a deadly threat to our fundamental rights.

IFF sent our submission which primarily questioned the mandate of the TRAI in creating such a framework; it then points out the concern of cloud cartelisation that would result out of regulation suggested and finally, the broader issue of self-regulation that appears to coat the essence of the paper.\nThe TRAI has no Jurisdication, Cloud service providers (\u0026lsquo;CSPs\u0026rsquo;) provide information technology services which are largely supervised by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology under the Information Technology Act, 2000. As these services use the telecom infrastructure which is regulated by the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951, the TRAI appears to use this to draw within its ambit the regulation of cloud services as well. However, our submissions emphasize on the distinction between the two and clearly state that any regulation should fall with the authority of MEITY to which the TRAI should not be able to frame binding directions.\nShould not be allowed to create Cloud Cartels, Having set out the authority, we looked closely at the suggestions put forth by the consultation paper; it indicates that cloud service providers should be regulated through not-for-profit industry bodies. This is a cause of concern as it involves registration requirements and even numerous conditions of which one specifies that only cloud service providers above a certain threshold are permitted to become a member. There is even a suggestion that the creation of industry bodies be based on the categories of cloud service providers.\nWhy is this a bad thing? The entire process of the creation of industry bodies for cloud service providers effectively brings to the fore the real possibility of cartelisation and its resulting anti-competitive effects. Our submission points out that the inclusion of entry and recurring fees which may be based on financial turnover will not only make it far more easier for large service providers to obtain better control over the market but will automatically exclude smaller providers from the same industry circles (especially those that financially constrained).\nIf you observe further, the paper also tends to only cater to industry bodies and the CSPs it includes, without considering its impact on the Indian consumer.\nOr self-regulate The established industry bodies have been recommended to curate a Code of Conduct that will aid in laying down mandatory standards and guidelines that CSPs will be required to adhere to. The essence of this code of conduct looks a lot like a self-regulatory mechanism. Irrespective of industry sector, our thoughts on self-regulation remain consistent; there is lack of legal form that binds any requirements put forth and the additional lack of formal oversight continues to be one of the major drawbacks.\nWhile these major initial submissions were made, we informed that aspects such as data, cyber-security and consumer safeguards continue to remain concerns that require regulation by legal frameworks and cannot be goverened through self-regulation.\nImportant Documents  Comments on the TRAI\u0026rsquo;s Consultation Paper on Cloud Services (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/we-must-prevent-cloud-cartel/","summary":"The TRAI invited comments on a consultation paper that suggested a framework for the registration of industry bodies for cloud services.

The petitioners argued that the restrictions were disproportionate because if the government wanted to prevent the use of fake propaganda to incite violence, it could have adopted less restrictive alternatives such as selectively blocking social media platforms. In response, the government stated that it was impossible to block selective platforms because terrorists would migrate to other platforms or use the dark web for their illegal activities.\nWait, what is this constitutional legal mumbo jumbo again? The Indian Constitution grants certain basic rights the status of fundamental rights and empowers any citizen to approach the Supreme Court or High Courts to seek remedy for their violation. These fundamental rights are enumerated in Part III of the Constitution and they include Articles 19 and 21. Article 19 guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression, peaceful assembly, association and free movement subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state and public order. It is also important to note that unless there is a declaration of emergency under Article 352, the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 19 can only be reasonably restricted and they cannot be suspended. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, and through judicial precedent, this right has been expansively interpreted to include the right to shelter, healthcare and education. The Indian judiciary has time and again emphasized that the right to life under Article 21 is more than mere animal existence and it includes various rights which are necessary to lead a dignified life.\nNational Security. Full Stop? Before we dive into whether the restrictions in Kashmir are reasonable and proportionate, we must first decide what is the appropriate standard of judicial review in cases where national security concerns are pleaded by the government. On this aspect, the petitioners submitted the Court should not accept the government’s assertion that the restrictions were temporary, need based and periodically reviewed at face value. Instead, the Court must determine if there was sufficient objective material to justify such severe restrictions. The petitioners drew parallels between the government’s arguments in this case and the infamous majority decision in ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla to emphasize that fundamental rights cannot be left at the mercy of executive benevolence.\nIn its response, the government clarified that it was not seeking exclusion of judicial review per se but it submitted that in cases involving national security concerns, the Court cannot function as an appellate authority. Issues involving national security are primarily within the domain of the executive and the Court should exercise restraint in such cases because the executive is best suited to make such decisions by virtue of knowing ground realities and receiving intelligence inputs. Therefore, once the Court is satisfied that a particular case has national security implications, the scope of judicial review is very limited.\nAre the restrictions reasonable and proportionate? The petitioners argued that restrictions cannot be so severe that they extinguish the right itself. Remember what we said earlier about the government being permitted to suspend fundamental rights under Article 19 only if there is a declaration of emergency under Article 352? That’s extremely important because the Constitution does not envisage a scenario where fundamental rights can be suspended in a “normal” situation. A declaration of emergency under Article 352 would also be subject to scrutiny by the parliament and this is a crucial safeguard. Therefore, by effectively suspending the right to free speech, peaceful assembly and movement in Kashmir without an official declaration of emergency, the government has managed to suspend rights while avoiding parliamentary scrutiny.\nThe petitioners argued that the restrictions had brought life in Kashmir to a standstill for millions of citizens. Since they could not make phone calls, access the internet or freely move out of their homes, people were unable to visit hospitals, attend school or carry on their business. If the government was concerned about fake propaganda which could incite the masses, it could have restricted access to social media platforms but there was no need to block voice calls and the internet in their entirety. The petitioners produced copies of previous shutdown orders from Bihar and Kashmir as examples of administrative authorities resorting to limited blocking of social media platforms to prevent public disorder. Since there was a less restrictive alternative available in the form of selective blocking of social media platforms, the government’s all encompassing ban on landlines, mobiles and the internet was disproportionate and unreasonable.\nThe Solicitor General cited statistics about how the restrictions in Kashmir had been gradually eased over the last three months and suggested that this demonstrates that the restrictions were need based and the administrative authorities had applied their mind before imposing them. The government argued that it was impossible to segregate criminals from law abiding citizens, and therefore, it was justified in imposing restrictions on all citizens in the region. The government further submitted that it was not possible to selectively block social media platforms and the only feasible solution was shutting down the internet entirely.\nIs access to the internet a fundamental right under Article 21? The petitioners explained that in the modern digital India, use of the internet was necessary to access government schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, banking facilities etc. The petitioners cited a recent Kerala High Court decision and the National Telecom Policy 2012 to support their stance that access to the internet is a fundamental right.\nThe Solicitor General did not directly address whether the government considered access to the internet to be a fundamental right but he characterized the internet as a dangerous tool capable of misuse. He argued that various cases relied on by the petitioners were not applicable because the standards for newspaper regulation and internet regulation should be different as the internet allows two way communication unlike newspapers. He further stated that social media allowed terrorists to reach a large number of people with minimal effort through the use of hashtags etc. He also raised alarm about the dark web which was encrypted, untraceable and used for illicit activities.\nThe Constitution of India was drafted decades before the invention of the internet but it is a visionary document which is intended to circumscribe the power of the State over the lives of citizens for centuries to come. Regardless of which side prevails, this case will certainly be a watershed moment in constitutional history about the status of the right to access the internet and what kind of restrictions can be placed on this right.\nImportant Documents  Part I of the Recap (link) Consolidated written submissions on behalf of petitioners and intervenors (link) Written submissions on behalf of the Solicitor General (link)  The rights of an entire population cannot be violated to prevent misdeeds by a few.

The orders under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 were assailed by the petitioners for lacking application of mind, being issued by an unauthorized official and for not being reviewed by the Review Committee constituted under the Rules. The government defended the orders by emphasizing that they were confirmed by the competent authority under the Rules and it was necessary to shut down communication channels because terrorists use voice and data services to spread fake propaganda and incite masses. The orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. were challenged by the petitioners for being unacceptably vague as they all use the same boilerplate language without mentioning any specific reasons necessitating their issuance.The government responded by urging the Court to not scrutinize the language of the orders too strictly because district magistrates are not legally trained persons. It also referred to various allegedly secessionist speeches made by political leaders in Kashmir which had the potential of inciting public disorder, and it argued that such provocative speeches along with undisclosed intelligence inputs demonstrated the necessity of imposing restrictions under Section 144, Cr.P.C.\nFirst let’s get the facts straight On 5 August 2019, a complete communication shutdown was imposed in the Kashmir valley region of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir. All landlines, voice calls, SMS services, broadband internet and mobile internet were shutdown in Kashmir. According to the government’s own figures, this complete blackout continued till 17 August when 8365 landline connections were restored out of a total of 43,114 connections. Landlines were completely restored in Kashmir only on 4 September, almost an entire month after the imposition of the communication shutdown. As on date, in Kashmir, landlines are functioning and voice call facilities on postpaid mobile connections have been restored. However, prepaid mobile connections and SMS services (which are essential for receiving One Time Passwords) remain suspended.\nIn addition to the communication shutdown, movement restrictions were also imposed in Kashmir on 5 August through orders passed under Section 144, Cr.P.C. While the government claims that the orders passed under Section 144, Cr.P.C. only prohibit public gatherings and not movement of individuals in general, the text of the orders filed by the government suggest otherwise. Don’t believe us? Well, see a sample for yourself.\n  According to the government’s affidavit, day time movement restrictions were eased in 35 out of 105 police stations in Kashmir on 17 August and they were completely removed in all 105 police stations only by 27 September, which is almost two months after their initial imposition on 5 August. However, even as on date, there continue to be night time movement restrictions in certain areas.\nIntroducing the Cast During these hearings, the Supreme Court heard two different petitions. The first petition was filed by Anuradha Bhasin, who is the Executive Director of Kashmir Times and it focused on how the restrictions on communication and movement violated the freedom of the press in Kashmir. The Foundation for Media Professionals, Indian Journalists Union, Tehseen Poonawalla and Soyaib Quereshi also intervened in Anuradha Bhasin’s petition to support press freedom. The second petition was filed by Ghulam Nabi Azad and raised concerns about the impact of the restrictions on the right to healthcare, education and livelihood.\nAnuradha Bhasin was represented by Vrinda Grover and Ghulam Nabi Azad was represented by Kapil Sibal. The intervening journalistic bodies, Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union were represented by Dushyant Dave and Huzefa Ahmadi respectively. The other intervention application filed by Tehseen Poonwalla and Soyaib Quereshi was argued by Meenakshi Arora.\nFrom the government’s side, the Union of India was represented by Attorney General, KK Venugopal, and the Former State of Jammu and Kashmir was represented by Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta. The Press Council of India also intervened in the matter and while its counsel refused to state which side it was supporting despite being questioned by the judges multiple times, it argued in favour of adopting a weaker version of the proportionality standard which would subject the restrictions in Kashmir to less rigorous review.\nAre the orders legal? Before we start, remember that there are two sets of orders issued by the government imposing restrictions in Kashmir. First, there are orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 which are responsible for suspension of landline, voice calls, SMS services, broadband internet and mobile internet in Kashmir. Second, there are orders issued under Section 144, Cr.P.C. imposing restrictions on movement of the public in Kashmir. It should be noted that none of these orders were made publicly available by the government and they were produced during the court proceedings after repeated requests by the petitioners.(i) Orders under Telecom Suspension Rules 2017\n  The petitioners argued that these orders demonstrate lack of application of mind before suspension of telecom services. For instance, one of the orders states that landlines should be shut down because there is “apprehension of misuse of data services by anti-national elements.” Shutting down landlines on this ground is absurd because landlines can only be used for one on one voice calls and they have no relation to data services and the internet. The petitioners further submitted that these orders were invalid because they were issued by the Inspector General of Police who is not authorized under the Rules. It should be noted that while the orders were confirmed by the Home Secretary who is the competent authority under the Rules, the government has not placed on record any document which authorized the Inspector General of Police to issue these orders in the first place. Moreover, despite being repeatedly sought by the petitioners, the government did not place on record any information about whether the orders were reviewed by the Review Committee constituted under the Rules, and if so, what were the findings of the Review Committee.\nThe Solicitor General did not specifically address any of these procedural violations in his oral arguments and merely submitted that the orders were confirmed by the Home Secretary who is empowered to suspend telecom services under the Rules. He argued that based on past experiences, it was known that voice and data services were used by terrorists and separatists to incite the masses, and therefore, it was necessary to shut down communication channels.\n(ii) Orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C.\nThe petitioners argued that by restricting the movement of the general public, the orders issued under Section 144, Cr.P.C. made it impossible for residents of Kashmir to access hospitals, schools, markets etc. Further, the orders are unacceptably vague and they all use the same boilerplate language without mentioning any specific reasons necessitating their issuance. On the legal aspects, the petitioners submitted that orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. can be issued only if there is objective material corroborating the government’s subjective threat perception, and the threat to public order or the security of the state must be imminent and genuine.The Solicitor General made extensive submissions to justify the orders issued under Section 144, Cr.P.C. He urged the Court to not scrutinize the language of the orders too closely like a statute because they were not issued by legally trained persons. The government submitted that the district magistrate does not have an obligation to state any material facts in the order and it is sufficient if he merely records that there is a law and order situation in the area.\nThe Solicitor General referred to allegedly provocative and secessionist comments made by political leaders such as Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah which could incite violence and submitted that such comments alongwith other undisclosed intelligence inputs formed the objective basis for issuance of orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. He argued that Section 144, Cr.P.C. permits the government to take preventive action in anticipation of danger, and therefore, the present restrictions which were intended to prevent incitement of violence and mass mobilization were valid in the facts and circumstances of the case.\nStay tuned for Part II of the Recap which will summarize the arguments made by all parties about whether these restrictions on communication and movement pass constitutional muster under Article 19 and 21.

Much of this will build off past work which will now provide a solid foundation to contrast the Government\u0026rsquo;s bill with civil society efforts to ensure a synthesis of the best ideas and language in this law.\n Engaging with Parliament: IFF has been consistently involved in ensuring that data protection finds its rightful place in India and this means it requires an all en-compassing legislative framework. An important chunk of this includes surveillance safeguards; the Bill in its current form makes no mention of this and as need for surveillance reform in India is close to our hearts, we encapsulate this in our work. Almost two years ago, with the help of our generous volunteers, we assisted the office of Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Lok Sabha, MP from Kerala in filing a user centric privacy bill in Parliament. This year, through Dr. Ravikumar Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu), a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code created by the SaveOurPrivacy campaign was introduced in Parliament as \u0026lsquo;Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019\u0026rsquo;(Read all about it here). Both these Bills relied heavily on the 7 Privacy Principles the Indian Privacy Code was based on. Advocacy with Ministries and Committees: Throughout the year, IFF has sent a number of representations to various Ministries and the Standing Committee of Information Technology highlighting the need for a data protection law to uphold the individual\u0026rsquo;s right to privacy and especially for transparency in content of the Bill that is to be introduced as law (Read more about it). Leading on public awareness: Be it through our explainers, social media and even events (remember #PrivacySupreme, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it fantastic?), we understand the importance in growing awareness of the need for the protection of one\u0026rsquo;s data. Litigation: We hold the clear belief that any Data Protection effort in India will be incomplete without surveillance reform. The reality of protecting the informational privacy of Individuals in India requires both to walk together in lock step together. India cannot protect people from profiling and 360 degree profiles if a data protection law only seeks to regulate the consensual gathering of personal data but does not address and regulate survelliance activities of the State and even private parties. As surveillance reform is clearly important to us, IFF has even approached the Supreme Court on this need as we challenge interception powers of the Government (Read here for more).  Continuing efforts Now that the Government proposes to introduce a Data Protection law in this Session of Parliament, we are concerned that we have become more concerned with the process (that has brought a degree of impatience) than the actual substance of the proposals. This is with good reason. It\u0026rsquo;s been a long and ardous wait. However, there is little reason to proceed with haste given the importance of this legislative effort.\nWe are today more concerned with the substance of this proposed law, which has yet to be made public since the Srikrishna Committee first proposed it. There exists little transparency on its proposals and the changes which have been made over the course of the year (or, even if not made) are of tremendous concern and mystery.\nWith the public left completely in the dark with regard to its content, we intend to take a few measures to ensure concerns with the law are addressed:\n Ensure referral: IFF will examine several options in our advocacy arsenal, to make sure the text of this bill is referred to the Standing Committee considering the lack of transparency and it is publicly unknown. We commit to working in partnership and collaborate with all civil society efforts, academics, experts and collectives. Persisting engagement: We will continue to work objectively to advance public interest. Through continued engagement with the Government in any way we can in upholding the right to privacy and the safeguards awarded through the data protection law. Focus on Individual rights: We will contiue to fight for you. There is a flood of technologies being used in a manner that violate individual rights. We will work tirelessly to ensure that each government programme, or private use impacting privacy is rights oriented by making sure dangerous proposals do not see the light of day.  We would like to do more, and have further impact! To do this, we need your support in any way possible.

He started by arguing that what happened on 05 August 2019 was a conferment of rights on the people of Jammu and Kashmir rather than a restriction of rights. According to him, due to the abrogation of Article 370, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir can now take advantage of 106 people friendly laws. He criticized the petitioner and intervenors for painting a grim picture of the situation prevailing in Kashmir and cited certain facts and figures to demonstrate normalcy in the region. He finally submitted that the powers under Section 144, CrPC could be invoked pre-emptively in anticipation of public disorder and urged the Court to not scrutinize the orders too stringently.\nNot in our names The Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta started arguments for the Former State of Jammu and Kashmir on an unexpected note today. He insisted that the actions of the government on 05 August 2019 must be applauded because they have conferred basic human rights that the people of Jammu and Kashmir were previously denied due to Article 370. Some of the examples cited by him include strengething of panchayati raj institutions, safai karamcharis and women being able to own property, SC/ST individuals being able to avail reservation benefits, central legislations on prohibition of child marriage, juvenile justice, domestic violence and right to education being made applicable to the region, and justice for West Pakistan refugees. The factual veracity of these claims is questionable, and this attempt at appropriation of progressive causes to justify the clampdown in Kashmir will be addressed by the petitioner and intervenors during their rejoinder.\nAll is well now in November Mr. Mehta accused the petitioner and intervenors of resorting to hyperbole and misrepresenting the situation on the ground in Kashmir. He criticized the petitioner and intervenors for failing to highlight the easing of restrictions by the government during their oral submissions and stated that the region has not been under complete clampdown for over 100 days. He added that since the restrictions have been significantly eased now, scrutinizing the state of affairs in August is an \u0026ldquo;academic exercise\u0026rdquo; and the case has outlived itself. He quoted government statistics relating to restoration of telecommunication services, easing of movement restrictions, board exam attendance rates, functioning of hospitals, provision for public transport, internet access terminals, tourism, media facilitation centre etc to counter the petitioner and intervenors' arguments about a humanitarian crisis existing in Kashmir.\nThese facts and figures were not made available to the petitioner, intervenors or the court in advance and they were tendered across the table during the hearing. The veracity of these factual assertions will also be challenged by the petitioner and intervenors during the rejoinder. For instance, the inadequate and insecure nature of the media facilitation centre had already been mentioned in the pleadings filed by the petitioner and the intervenors but the government did not address any of these concerns. Read more about the problems with the media facilitation centre in Srinagar here and here.\nCracking nuts with sledgehammers Throughout today’s hearing, the government maintained that the vast majority of people in Kashmir are law abiding and peace loving. However, there is a “miniscule minority” which indulges in separatism and cross border terrorism, and the government had to impose restrictions on everyone because they cannot separate the chaff from the grain.\nThe Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta and Attorney General, KK Venugopal cited historical figures relating to terrorist violence since 1990 and the Supreme Court’s observations in another case about Pakistan supporting terrorist groups like the Hurriyat to establish why these restrictions were required. The government lawyers claimed that terrorists were not just physically penetrating India’s borders but they were also mobilizing people through digital platforms. However, the government did not explain why one to one modes of communication such as landlines and voice calls which cannot be used for mass messaging were shutdown and why the restrictions were not limited to social media platforms.\nMr. Mehta further urged the court to not evaluate the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. imposing movement restrictions too strictly because they were issued by district magistrates who are not legally trained. He also argued that the fact that several restrictions were either not imposed or relaxed sooner in Jammu and Ladakh compared to Kashmir demonstrates that there was application of mind by the government officials.\nThe Solicitor General will continue his arguments on Monday, 25 November 2019 and the petitioner and intervenors will respond to the government’s assertions after that.

Our primary ask has been that the Committee invite those affected by the hacking to provide testimonials!\nSome background If you haven\u0026rsquo;t caught up with the ongoings of India\u0026rsquo;s recent cyber-security incident, here\u0026rsquo;s a statement we put out on the issue in case you need a bit of catching up to do (Read here for more). In brief, relying on spyware supplied by an Israeli cyber-intelligence firm, which was installed through a missed call on Whatsapp after which an attacker would gain complete access to a smartphone, individuals in India were found to have been targetted.\nSpecific asks of the Committee Our representation covered the lack of legality, the violation of privacy and the unavailability to remedy, as we did with the Committee on Home Affairs. However, the most significant of the asks we made of the Committee lies in the request that the victims of the hacking be given the stage to provide testimonials before the Committees. A number of these individuals have even put out a statement asking the Government to reveal information on the issue (Read here for more) and have even expressed willingness to depose before the Committee (Read here for more). It is important that these first hand human experiences be provided to fully demonstrate the patently criminal surveillance they have been subjected to.\nIn light of all of this, here\u0026rsquo;s an interesting titbit, Isreali law requires that an export permit is granted for the sale of this software (there\u0026rsquo;s a whole licensing process), therefore, the software supplied by the NSO Group is regulated under this. So, we thought it was important for the Committee to consider inviting the Israeli government to appear before the them to shed some light. Further, in Facebook\u0026rsquo;s civil complaint in the California Court, an annexure of a contract between the NSO Group and Ghana indicates that the \u0026lsquo;System Provider\u0026rsquo; which is the NSO Group shall receive a certificate which would also contain the identity of the \u0026lsquo;end user\u0026rsquo;. This would be particularly interesting information to happen upon in order to establish identity in the attacks in India.\nLooking at the bigger picture, we did touch upon broader concerns of India cyber-security with these suggestions for consideration.\n Need for updation: India’s National Cybersecurity Policy has not seen any amendments since 2013 and while the new National Cybersecurity Coordinator has indicated that his office is seeking to ensure India has a new Cybersecurity Strategy in 2020, Parliament must act to ensure that this is openly consulted on, drawing on inputs from security researchers and other Indians who can provide their expertise to ensure a stronger National Cybersecurity Strategy that has widespread public support and awareness. Lack of guidance: The time for a permanent advisory body is now more than ever. There is need for continuous counsel on matters of advancing technology and we have encouraged the Committee to ask the Government on how it can form a standing Digital Security Advisory body with stakeholders beyond civil servants, particularly as existing statutory bodies such as the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee - mandated by the Information Technology Act - appear to be dormant.  While the heat of these events begins to fade, we hope that the Committee considers our suggestions to ensure it is made fully aware of the incident and its hit to India\u0026rsquo;s cybersecurity.\nImportant Documents:  Representation to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology dated 20.11.2019 [link] Statement on the Pegasus Spyware hack [link]  We\u0026rsquo;re fighting for surveillance reform in India!

Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing on behalf of IJU compared the government’s stance in the present case to the infamous majority decision in ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla during the Emergency. He further urged the Court to consider the proportionality of the restrictions and whether they were narrowly tailored and the least restrictive alternative available to the government. Mr. Dushyant Dave appearing for the Foundation for Media Professionals extensively cited the Constituent Assembly Debates to emphasize the Supreme Court’s role as the guardian of fundamental rights against executive action which always favours social control over individual liberty. He also relied upon a recent Kerala High Court decision and the National Telcom Policy 2012 to argue that in a digitized world where internet connectivity is necessary to access essential services, access to the internet is a fundamental right.\nADM Jabalpur: The sequel no one wants to watch Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, the Senior Advocate appearing for IJU, began his arguments yesterday by referring to the infamous majority decision in ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla which is widely considered to be the darkest hour in the Supreme Court’s history. He drew parallels between the government’s affidavit and the majority reasoning in ADM Jabalpur which left fundamental rights at the mercy of executive benevolence. Interestingly, the arguments were happening in Court No. 2 where a portrait of the sole dissenting judge in ADM Jabalpur, Justice HR Khanna hangs on the walls.\n  \u0026ldquo;Justice HR Khanna: Guys, please don\u0026rsquo;t make me say I told you so.\u0026rdquo;\n  Mr. Ahmadi then proceeded to explain that orders under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure can be passed only if there is genuine apprehension of public disorder based on material facts relating to a specific area. For instance, the government could issue orders under Section 144 for certain districts which are especially volatile but it cannot impose blanket restrictions throughout the state. He explained that security concerns would vary depending on various factors such as whether a district is close to the border etc. and the government should assess the situation in each district individually and provide specific reasons.While discussing proportionality, Mr. Ahmadi cited the 5 judge bench decision in KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India which struck down mandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts because such a requirement presumed that everyone was a money launderer. In KS Puttaswamy, the Supreme Court had held that “a mere ritualistic incantation of money laundering and black money” would not satisfy the proportionality test and justify mandatory Aadhar linkage if there were other KYC methods available. Similarly, in this case, the government could not merely cite vague national security concerns to justify such prolonged and severe restrictions on an entire population.\nWho will save us from becoming a police state if not the judiciary? Mr. Dushyant Dave, the Senior Advocate appearing for FMP, started by noting that the government had treated this case in a cavalier manner and caused significant delay despite the fundamental rights of millions of citizens being at stake. The Court then cautioned the government that the Solicitor General would have to argue as soon as the intervenors finish and no further adjournment would be granted.\nMr. Dave began by quoting from an Israeli Supreme Court decision where the judges held that enhanced interrogation techniques were not permissible in a democracy even if this means that the government must fight terrorism with one hand tied behind its back. In a democractic set-up, the government cannot resort to the same kind of tactics that terrorists do, and if such an attempt is made, it is the duty of the judiciary to strike it down. Mr. Dave then extensively quoted from the Constituent Assembly Debates to explain how the framers intended the Supreme Court to act as a bulwark against the excesses of the executive branch which is always more concerned about social control than individual liberty.\nMr. Dave further argued that the government has imposed the communication shutdown and movement restrictions to prevent people from voicing their protest against the abrogation of Article 370. He then cited the recent Hong Kong High Court decision which struck down an anti-face mask measure as disproportionate despite violent demonstrations having taken place. He cautioned the Court against accepting the government’s vague arguments about national security which lack any material basis because it would set a dangerous precedent. He argued that similar restrictions could next be imposed in states with high Naxalite presence and the Court must intervene to prevent India from becoming a police state.\nMr. Dave cited several cases to establish that the fundamental right to life under Article 21 must be interpreted broadly to include the right to access the internet. He relied upon a recent Kerala High Court decision and the National Telcom Policy 2012 to argue that in a digitized world, internet connectivity is a basic need like health or education. He concluded his arguments by asking the Court to evaluate the restrictions based on the situation prevailing in Kashmir in August, and not in November when some of the restrictions have been eased. He also criticised the government’s practice of submitting material evidence in sealed covers because petitioners can never meet a case they do not know.\nRolling Credits IJU was represented by Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, Advocate on Record, Mr. Shadan Farasat, and Advocates, Jahnavi Sindhu and Shruti Narayan. FMP was represented by Senior Advocate, Mr. Dushyant Dave, Advocate on Record, Astha Sharma, and Advocates, Apar Gupta, Vrinda Bhandari, Kajal Dalal, Abhishek Manchanda and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay.\nVarious news outlets such as Live Law, Bar and Bench and the Quint have published excellent detailed reports about the hearings in the case, and you should definitely check them out as well.\nThe next date of hearing in the case is Thursday, 21 November 2019 where Senior Advocate, Ms. Meenakshi Arora will continue arguments on behalf of a Kashmir based lawyer who has also intervened in the case. After Ms. Arora concludes, the Solicitor General will begin arguments for the government.\nImportant Documents  Written Submissions filed by FMP (link)  Today it is Kashmir, tomorrow it could be any state in India.

The DNA Bill aims to regulate the use and outputs of DNA technology in certain cases and has been the subject of many a debate. It was introduced once again in July 2019 in the Lok Sabha after having lapsed in 2018. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change on October 18. The Committee invited comments on the Bill till November 18 and oh, did we have a lot of comments.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s it all about? India has been attempting to introduce legislation that regulates DNA technology since the early 2000\u0026rsquo;s but thankfully has been largely unsuccessful until recently, making our fears quite real. The current DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 has seen a number of redrafts bringing it to its present form and yet continues to be problematic.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re grateful to be able to voice these concerns as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change has invited comments on the Bill after it was referred to them. Unfortunately, as submissions made cannot be fully public prior to the Committee publishing their report, so we highlight our major concerns to give you an understanding of why we think the DNA Bill not only needs to undergo further work but also needs to be introduced only after a solid data protection law is in place.\nA few of our very many concerns  No data protection legislative framework: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, the lack of obligation within the Bill to ensure protection especially by the DNA Laboratory as a either mere collectors or even processors of the DNA collected, have no alternative safeguards in place to remedy data breaches or ensure informed consent. Similarly, there is nothing to govern the sharing of such sensitive data, ensuring purpose limitation is maintained. Profiling and surveillance: DNA profiles can reveal extremely sensitive information about an individual such as their skin colour, illness, susceptibility to diseases and any access to such intrusive information can be misused to specifically target individuals with their own genetic data and is particularly worrying as it could be used to incorrectly link a particular caste/community to criminal activities. Further, in the event that such a databases are then linked to others worrying databases in existence, it is bound to give rise to Government conducted mass surveillance. Overbroad provisions: Our submission tackles the lack of legitimate use by the Bill; it indicates that DNA technology intends to be used for extremely wide criminal and civil purposes (alarm bells are ringing). We argue that the Bill as such extensive databasing of DNA data requires to meet the conditions set by the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s judgement in Puttaswamy of which one is a greater public purpose, the databasing of DNA used in civil cases does not fulfill this criteria. Further, even within criminal cases, there is need to limit the collection of DNA to the investigation and prosecution of cognizable crimes to ensure the data in the DNA database is minimal and controlled.  The submission details a plethora of other concerns ranging from lack of privacy safeguards such as no informed consent, storage and sharing of information and the power of the DNA profiling board.\nWe are grateful that the Committee has invited non-official witnesses/experts to provide their views on November 27 and hope that both written and oral submissions that come their way will be taken into strong consideration, resulting in the suggestion of a much required revising of the Bill.\nImportant Documents:  Cover letter attached to the call for comments on the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation, 2019 by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change dated 18.11.2019 [link]  Want the Government to know you inside-out?

He had also sought “token damages” of Rs. 5 crores for the harm caused to his reputation by anonymous allegations which were originally posted on Instagram and subsequently reported on by various news publications. In today’s hearing, the Court permitted the owner of the Instagram handle, Scene and Herd to file a vakalatnama in sealed cover and submit a redacted written statement responding to the defamation suit. The Court also issued notice in the impleadment application filed by the Indian Journalists Union and directed the Plaintiff to respond to the contentions raised in the application regarding overbroad censorship of news reports which adhere to professional journalistic standards of reporting.\nBackground During the MeToo movement last year, an anonymous Instagram handle called Scene and Herd began posting accounts of sexual harassment suffered by young women in the art world. In December 2018 and January 2019, the account published two posts containing allegations of sexual harassment against Subodh Gupta. Since Subodh Gupta is a well known public figure, many newspapers, magazines and online news portals reported about the existence of these allegations. A vast majority of the news reports reached out to Subodh Gupta for his side of the story and published his response while informing the public about the anonymous allegations which had surfaced.\nNearly 9 months after the anonymous allegations first surfaced on Instagram, Subodh Gupta filed a defamation suit before the Delhi High Court against Scene and Herd and intermediaries such as Instagram, Facebook and Google. In his defamation suit, he sought removal of the Instagram posts and news reports containing anonymous allegations of sexual harassment against him. Curiously, despite explicitly seeking removal of news reports and terming them as defamatory, Subodh Gupta did not implead any of the journalists, editors or news outlets as defendants in the defamation suit.\nThrough an order dated 30 September 2019, the Delhi High Court directed Google to de-index all URLs which would be supplied by Subodh Gupta within 72 hours. The list supplied by Subodh Gupta’s lawyers to Google contained 79 URLs, and many of these URLs hosted news reports which only tangentially referred to the allegations against Subodh Gupta in passing. Even among the news reports which were primarily concerned with the allegations against Subodh Gupta, the vast majority adhered to professional journalistic standards of reporting. The news reports clarified that these were anonymous allegations which had surfaced on Instagram and did not present them as proven facts. More importantly, the journalists provided Subodh Gupta an opportunity to respond and included his denial in the article.\nWhat happened in today’s hearing? In today’s hearing, Senior Advocate, Ritin Rai, appearing for the Indian Journalists Union, urged the Court to consider how its previous order could be misused to gag the press. Since the order dated 30 September 2019 allows Subodh Gupta to seek de-indexing of any URL from the Google search engine without prior judicial scrutiny, it could be used to censor all unfavourable reportage. He used the example of a recent news article in the Indian Express about Facebook’s decision to oppose disclosure of Scene and Herd’s identity and explained that if Subodh Gupta wanted, he could even seek de-indexing of this news article because it mentions that allegations of sexual harassment have been levelled against him. Therefore, judicial scrutiny is necessary to determine if the news articles sought to be removed are actually defamatory or constitute fair reporting.\nThe crux of the Indian Journalists Union’s application is that journalists cannot be prevented from reporting on allegations against public figures merely because the source of the information is anonymous. This is especially true in the context of sexual harassment because women are often reluctant to disclose their identity because they fear retailiation and further victimization by powerful perpetrators. The MeToo movement was a moment of reckoning after years of silence and stigma, and it highlighted how formal greivance redressal mechanisms had failed survivors of sexual harassment. The press has a right and a duty to report on allegations against persons holding positions of power and such reportage is in the public interest. The public should be allowed to learn about the existence of these anonymous allegations against Subodh Gupta, read his version of events, and then make an informed decision about how much credence they want to give to these allegations.\nThe owner of the Scene and Heard Instagram handle was represented in court today through their lawyers. The Court allowed the owner of the account to file a vakalatnama in sealed cover and also permitted them to submit a written statement responding to the defamation suit with identifying details redacted. At this stage, the Court has permitted Scene and Herd to contest anonymously to establish why their identity should not be revealed and it is unclear whether anonymity will be preserved throughout the trial. The Court also issued notice in another impleadment application filed by the Culture Workers Support Trust represented by Senior Advocate, Jayna Kothari.IFF provided drafting and research support for the Indian Journalists Union’s impleadment application with most of the heavy lifting being done by Shreya Munoth, Amritananda Chakravorty, Amala Dasarathi, Sanjana Srikumar and Kritika Bharadwaj. We are also extremely grateful to Senior Advocate, Ritin Rai who argued on behalf of the Indian Journalists Union.

Press reports indicate interest has been showed by the Standing Committee on Home Affairs in examining the matter. We wrote to them with a few suggestions on the issue to take into consideration at their meeting today.\nSome background Our representation made sure to provide the Committee with brief background information on the incident. We covered our bases by explaining the role of CitizenLab, the NSO Group and the discovery of the attacks in India. We previously put out a statement on the issue in case you need a bit of catching up to do (Read here for more).\nOur worries We provide sufficient emphasis on the lack of legality to this entire fiasco. Here are a few snippets of our explanation:\n No legality: There is no provision under Indian law under any circumstance that provides legal basis for the installation of such spyware; the powers under the pre-existing surveillance provisions of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking of mobile devices or computer resources, which is in fact criminalised under the Information Technology Act, 2000. Unimaginable hit to privacy: The constitutional standard established in K. S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India ((2017) 10 SCC 1) applicable to the violation of the right to privacy, finds this instance of snooping to go way beyond the requirements of proportionality and necessity, conditions heavily mandated. _No remedy: A_s secrecy is an inherent trait of surveillance, the individual under surveillance has no manner of proving it thereby being unable to establish a breach which curtails remedy to an individual under Article 32 and 226 of the Constitution.  In light of these concerns, we offered a few suggestions for the Committee to consider in their discussions on the issue.\n Testimonials and expert opinions: We ask that individuals affected by this large breach of privacy be invited to provide testimonials in order for the Committees to gather necessary information it requires for it to take any necessary measures. Need for disclosure: There is need for engagement with the Government in order to obtain clarity on this deep violation of human rights. We ask that significant Government officials be invited to depose before the Committees in order to obtain transparency through official disclosure of these concerning series of events. Call for a moratorium: In line with the key recommendation made by the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, we request the Committee to publicly state the need for an immediate moratorium on the use or purchase of human rights violating surveillance technology by the Government until rigorous safeguards are put in place.  We hope the Committee has taken our inputs into consideration and addressed the looming concerns this incident has raised with regard to surveillance practices in India.\nImportant Documents:  Representation to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs dated 14.11.2019 [link]  Agree that India needs surveillance reform?

We recently even received a response from the NCRB to a legal notice sent to them. But in light of the continuing growing concerns of CCTVs and facial recognition technology in the recent weeks, we throw a few more kicks to fight against this trajectory of mass surveillance.\nOur worries still remain Facial recognition softwares have created a cause for concern not only in India but across the world. Blatant issues of misindentification, discriminatory profiling and just incredibly high levels of inaccuracy have been demonstrated even by researchers in Georgetown and MIT.\nRecently, in the Delhi High Court in Sadhan Haldar v. The State NCT of Delhi \u0026amp; Ors (W.P. (CRL) 1560/2017) before the High Court of Delhi, the Ministry of Woman and Child Development has submitted that the facial recognition software used by the Delhi Police to identify missing children is so inaccurate that not only was its match rate only 1%, it also misidentified pictures of boys with that of girls.\nStep by step attack  Axe Kick: Correspond with Government bodiesWe sent a legal notice to the NCRB with a copy to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on the illegality of the tender for Automated Facial Recognition Systems explaining the current lack of legislative safeguards to oversee such a technology and the features that create widespread cause for concern (Read here for more). Our previous post updated you on the back and forth we\u0026rsquo;ve had with the NCRB recently. Vertical Front Kick: Few QuestionsAs always, we\u0026rsquo;re armed with all the RTI\u0026rsquo;s we could possible file. So in response to one sent to the NCRB, we were given minutes of the meeting held with the bidders for the AFRS but other information requested was denied on account of the tender process still going on. According to the response, most vendors asked for an extension; specifically for a consortium to bid for the tender, certain standards required by the systems and especially whether systems should be able to identify cases of plastice surgery (Have a closer look at the response). We have filed another RTI with the Airport Authority of India on the deployment of facial recognition in airports in Varanasi, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Vijaywadi for copies of tenders, bids and minutes of any meetings. Final leg sweep: Floods of QuestionsThe deployment of such facial recognition systems is largely reliant on the installation of CCTVs and is being conducted extensively in various states. Hence, we filed RTIs with the states of New Delhi, Bangalore, Jammu and Kashmir, and Maharastra. Delhi: Informed that most of the information abouf the Request for Proposal and bids submitted was available in the public domain and that no entities were empanelled for the project (Read here for more). Maharashtra: It provided information of the number of cameras, the period of storage and the agencies that have access to the CCTV footage (Read here for more). Concerned with how this has extended to installation of CCTV\u0026rsquo;s in schools as well, on the request of a student that reached out to us, we filed an RTI with Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law in Punjab on the CCTVs on campus. The response was overwhelming with a total of 74 CCTVs and even specified a list of locations where the CCTVs are located (Read here for more).  We are well aware of the limited public funds in place and systems that are neither accurate nor in accordance with the protection of individual fundamental protections are an incredible cost to public exchequer and the rights of an individual. While these technologies may be a comforting scarecrow, we need to be careful of its eyes in disguise.\nImportant Documents:  Response to the RTI filed with the National Crime Records Bureau dated 09.09.2019 [link] Response to the RTI filed with the State of Maharashtra on CCTVs [link] Response to the RTI filed with the State of New Delhi on CCTVs [link] Response to the RTI filed with the Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law on CCTVs [link] Recent post on Facial Recognition Systems [link]  Everybody is kungfu fighting\u0026hellip; against mass surveillance!

With no response, we sent a follow up on October 31, 2019, to which we received a very detailed reply by the NCRB on November 5, 2019. Excitedly, we readied ourselves to send across a rejoinder to their response but much to our dismay, we largely had to restate our original asks.\nPosition unchanged The follow up to our legal notice was graced by peculiar circumstances. The NCRB responded on November 5, 2019 with a detailed parawise reply to our notice dated August 18, 2019. However, not long after, we received emails from NCRB officials stating that they wished to recall the email response sent to us. Naturally, we wrote back enquiring if an updated or finalised version of the document needed to be sent, to which there has been no clarification.\nGiven the tender closes today, we promptly sent across our rejoinder two days back, in the same format of their response. It involved us indulging in a lot of rebutting and here\u0026rsquo;s what we had to say briefly.\n Main submission dealt with legalityOur legal notice informed the NCRB that there was no legislative framework that gave AFRS any legality and we reiterated that once again. Why? Because the NCRB informed us that AFRS will be hosted on the CCTNS database which finds its supposed legality in the CCTNS Cabinet Note of 2009. We made sure to explain that a cabinet note is not a statutory enactment but a record of proceedings, and hence, AFRS continues to lack legality. We very clearly observed that the use of such systems on dead bodies appears slightly redundant on account of bodies beginning to decompose within 24 hours after death, which does not justify public expenditure on this. Flawed understanding of consent The response was firm in stating that the principle of consent would not be violated but did not have much to substantiate this point. It also says that Aadhaar would not be integrated with AFRS. We sure had a lot to say to this; our rejoinder pointed out the inadvertent access that the integration of various databases will provide. Further, the Aadhaar database, through the already existing access State police have, quite clearly violates consent considering that an individual may have only given consent to one database and its use. Systems are apparently too cutting edge Our concerns of misidentification and discriminatory profiling were met with blanket responses that AFRS would simply not face these problems as it would meet NIST standards (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and also have sufficient safeguards in its Standard Operating Procedure. Our response makes sure to highlight how without any legal framework, there would be nothing to provide for strict safeguards and also cases from San Francisco and Massachusetts that have found that their cutting edge technology too faces concerns of misidentification and discriminatory profiling. No need for proportionality/safeguards but oversight and accountability will still existThe response by the NCRB claims that there would be no need for proportionality or any safeguards and they substantiate this with requirements provided for device security and unauthorised access. We point out their misunderstanding of proportionality and safeguards by explaining our worries of mass surveillance that could ensue because of such unregulated technology.  Stop! In the name of law It is important to note that a lot of what the NCRB has stated, marks a large departure from what the Request for Proposal (the tender document) states. Although we appreciate the NCRB\u0026rsquo;s efforts in responding to our legal notice, at the end of this, we had to restate most of our initial submissions. While we do not want to take any credit for this outcome, the date for the tender has once again been extended to January 3, 2020.\nAs a result, our rejoinder continues to ask for a withdrawl of this tender and a moratorium on all privacy invading projects until a data protection law and authority is in existence. We intend to examine all legal options to challenge it after conferring with counsel if it proceeds further.\nImportant Documents:  IFF rejoinder dated November 6, 2019 to NCRB response dated November 5, 2019 [link] NCRB Response dated November 5, 2019 to IFF legal notice dated August 18, 2019 [link] Follow up Representation by IFF to NCRB dated October 31, 2019 [link] Previous post on Facial Recognition Systems [link] Legal notice to the National Crime Records Bureau dated August 18, 2019 [link]  Do you see eye-to-eye with us on how problematic facial recognition systems can be?

She argued that restrictions cannot be so severe that they extinguish the right itself. She used the government’s own statistics to show that there is no proximate relationship between introduction of internet and rise in terrorism. She also analysed the orders produced by the government to demonstrate that there was no application of mind by the state officials.\nNo proximate link between internet and terrorism related violence The hearing commenced with arguments by Ms. Vrinda Grover, who is appearing for the lead Petitioner. Ms. Grover informed the bench that prepaid mobile services, mobile internet, broadband internet and SMS services were still not available in Kashmir Valley. She then explained the work structure of Kashmir Times where reporters gather news, editorial inputs are received from the Jammu office and the newspaper is then sent for printing.\nMs. Grover emphasized that restrictions on fundamental rights must be necessary, reasonable and proportionate, and the restriction cannot extinguish the right itself. She used the statistics mentioned in the government’s affidavit to demonstrate that terrorism related violence has decreased significantly in Jammu \u0026amp; Kashmir despite introduction of the internet in the region in 2000s. Therefore, the State’s own data shows that there is no proximate relationship between use of internet and terrorism related violence.\n1885 Act?! When Ms. Grover began explaining the provisions of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 issued under Section 7 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the bench was surprised! The judges found it difficult to believe that modern technologies such as the internet were being licensed and regulated under a colonial era 19th century law.\nMs. Grover quoted the proviso to Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, 1885 which states that “the press messages intended to be published in India of correspondents accredited to the Central Government or a State Government shall not be intercepted or detained, unless their transmission has been prohibited under this sub-section.” She then relied upon this proviso to argue that communication channels of the press cannot be blocked through a general order issued under the 2017 Rules, and instead, a specific order would be required.\nThis was followed by an analysis of the orders issued under the 2017 Rules to demonstrate complete non-application of mind by the government officials. For instance, one of the orders stated that landlines should be shutdown because there is “apprehension of misuse of data services by anti-national elements.” Ms. Grover argued that shutting down landlines on this ground was absurd because landlines can be only be used for one on one voice calls and have no relation to data services and the internet.\nThe hearing ended at 1:00 PM with the Court breaking for lunch and Ms. Grover will continue her arguments tomorrow.\nDid you know that India has the highest number of internet shutdowns in the world?

Union of India commences"},{"content":"  Tl;dr IFF filed RTIs with various state governments seeking copies of internet shutdown orders issued under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017. While most states gave obfuscatory responses, Bihar was the only state which has provided actual copies of orders. An analysis of the orders provides two interesting insights. First, the orders only direct blocking of specific mass messaging platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp etc. and do not require suspension of internet services in their entirety. Second, while the Rules state that orders must contain reasons explaining why there is a threat of public emergency or threat to public safety, the orders issued by the Bihar Government are extremely vague.\nBackground In mid June 2019, IFF filed RTIs with almost all state governments seeking information about internet shutdowns since 2010 under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 (‘Telecom Suspension Rules 2017’). The responses received from most state governments were highly disappointing with different departments transferring the RTI application to each other endlessly, claiming that no information was available with them or stating that they were an exempt entity under Section 24 of the RTI Act. The Bihar Government was a notable exception and it agreed to provide us access to copies of actual orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017.\nFirst, let’s start with the good stuff We must give the Bihar Government credit when it is due and we appreciate that, unlike many other states, it complied with its obligation to ensure transparency in governance by answering our RTI queries. We were provided copies of 29 orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 in 2017 and 2018.\nMuch to our surprise, an analysis of these orders revealed that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 were being used by the state government to block access to specific mass messaging platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp instead of suspending access to internet services in their entirety. In some aspects, the orders were relatively narrow. **** For instance, ISPs were only directed to block uploads on YouTube. ISPs cannot usually block specific features on a platform as anything over HTTPS only allows yes/no blocking of the entire website or application. However, for large payloads like video, this may be possible by dropping the connection based on send/receive ratio. In certain other aspects, the orders were open-ended and quite broad. For instance, in addition to specific websites and mobile applications listed by the government, ISPs were also expected to suspend access to “other social networking sites meant for mass messaging.”\nBlocking of websites and mobile applications should typically happen under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Rules made thereunder. However, the powers under Section 69A are only available with the Central Government, and not State Governments. This may have motivated the Bihar Government to resort to the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to issue these orders.\nAlas, there is much scope for improvement Under Rule 2(2) of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017, the competent authority has an obligation to specify reasons for the issuance of an order. Unfortunately, none of the orders we have analysed meaningfully comply with this requirement. All the orders copy paste the same boilerplate language about how the local administration apprehends that anti social elements will spread objectionable content which could cause disaffection and disharmony or incite violence. However, none of the orders mention any specific incidents which have given rise to this apprehension.\nAs we have previously noted in the context of telecom suspension orders relating to Kashmir, this type of vagueness is deeply problematic because it prevents us from being able to evaluate the “reasonableness” and “proportionality” of these restrictions. This demonstrates how opacity in the use of powers under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 is a pan-India problem.\nParliamentary questions have revealed that the Central Government does not maintain any record of internet shutdowns ordered by State Governments and it has not conducted any review of the working of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. Unless there is official recordkeeping and periodic review of the social, economic and political impact of internet shutdowns, we fear that arbitrary use of these extraordinary powers will continue. IFF and other civil society organizations such as SFLC have tried to bring about greater transparency and accountability in the telecom suspension process through RTIs but the primary responsibility for proactive disclosure of shutdown orders must remain with the government.\nImportant Documents  Copy of orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 by the Bihar Government (link)  Internet shutdowns affect so many but we know so little about them due to lack of transparency.

The spyware, “Pegasus” would be installed through a missed call on Whatsapp after which an attacker would gain complete access to a smartphone. As per the NSO Group, “Pegasus” was only sold to government clients. Subsequent reports by Huffington Post and News Laundry have revealed that the targets include lawyers in the Bhima Koregaon case, Bela Bhatia and Anand Teltumbde. This raises some extremely disturbing questions about likely illegal hacking by unknown government agencies- or other actors operating in India- and suggests flagrant disregard for the rule of law and contempt for our fundamental right to privacy.\nThere is an urgent need for official disclosure on whether and how this spyware was used in India to hack our citizens. The Government of India must issue an official public statement providing complete information. The Government must also clarify which law empowers it to install such spyware. To the best of our understanding and knowledge, no such power exists under Indian law, and the pre-existing surveillance powers available under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking mobile devices. Hacking of computer resources, including mobile phones and apps, is in fact a criminal offence under the Information Technology Act, 2000.\nThis expose signals a need for urgent surveillance reform to protect citizens against the use of malware, spyware and creation of vulnerabilities in technologies which offer privacy protection by design. We call on the Government to stand by democratic commitments and reject the use of spyware in their pursuit of social objectives of policing and security. Legislative measures must be introduced in Parliament to uphold the 9 judge bench decision of the Supreme Court of India recognizing privacy as a fundamental right. The use of legal or technical means to access data and intercept communications in India must be authorised only in emergency situations, under judicial control and oversight, and with other protections to safeguard our citizens.\nOver the next few weeks, we at IFF will attempt to reach out to any victims of illegal surveillance in India and we will make every attempt to ensure that they can access the legal system to seek redress. We will also examine avenues for further engagement with all branches of government - legislative, executive and judicial- to advance our ongoing work on surveillance reform.\nIn addition to seeking transparency through full disclosure, we hope to work towards solutions to ensure that something like this never happens again. We will continue our public advocacy through the SaveOurPrivacy Campaign which seeks to put forth a model draft law that provides for judicial oversight and parliamentary controls in the surveillance process. In July, a revised version of this model draft law was introduced in Parliament as a private member’s bill by Dr. Ravikumar as the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 which if enacted may help prevent such a recurrence.\nIf you have been affected by this breach, we are here to help and please feel free to reach out to us at [policy@internetfreedom.in].\nImportant Documents:\n Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 introduced in Parliament (link) IFF’s Surveillance Reform PIL (W.P.

Two journalistic bodies- Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union- had intervened in the case to support press freedom in Kashmir. Yesterday, the State Government filed an additional affidavit stating that the communication shutdown was necessary because of cross-border terrorism and it has declined to provide any further explanation or materials to the Petitioner or Intervenors.\nState Government files Additional Affidavit On the factual aspects, the Government has argued that Jammu and Kashmir has a history of cross-border terrorism and the communication shutdown is necessary because terrorists \u0026ldquo;not only physically penetrate the Indian borders\u0026rdquo; but also \u0026ldquo;digitally penetrate to take advantage of certain local situation.\u0026quot; The Government has also cited the three month long internet shutdown imposed in the State in 2016 after the death of Burhan Wani to cast aspersions and demanded that the Court seek an explanation from the Petitioner about why she did not approach the judiciary then.\nWith respect to production of orders, the Government has annexed specimen orders which do not provide any clear reasons for their issuance. The specimen orders are extremely vague and merely state that data services should be suspended or slowed down to 2G speed \u0026ldquo;in view of apprehension of misuse of data services by anti-national elements.\u0026quot; The Government has characterized the demand for production of orders as a \u0026ldquo;roving and fishing enquiry\u0026rdquo; which must not be permitted. The Government has also strenuously objected to the Petitioner and Intervenors being provided access to the material based on which these orders have been issued but has agreed to let the Court view it.\nRegarding the applicable legal standards, the Government has urged the Court to defer to the opinion of the administrative authorities in Kashmir because they are aware of ground realities and such decisions always involve an element of subjectivity. Further, the Government has cited a case in which the Supreme Court upheld a complete ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks (State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat) to argue that a total prohibition on exercise of fundamental rights is justified if there is no lesser adequate alternative. Finally, the Government has reiterated its stance that the communication shutdown was a temporary and need based restriction which was aimed at \u0026ldquo;pre-empting inflammation of passions, rumour mongering etc.\u0026quot;\nSupreme Court adjourns matter for oral arguments Although the case was originally supposed to be heard on Friday, 25 October 2019, it was unexpectedly listed a day earlier. To the best of our knowledge, the change happened because the judges were busy with another matter tomorrow. The Court indicated that since all parties have filed their pleadings, the lawyers could commence their oral arguments on the next date and listed the case for hearing on 5 November 2019.\nDuring the brief hearing, the Court indicated that the Solicitor General should provide a clear time frame for easing of restrictions, and even if the restrictions were justified in public interest, they should be periodically reviewed. The Counsel for the Petitioner, Ms. Vrinda Grover stated that the orders of the Review Committee should be produced if the Government is claiming that it is constantly monitoring the situation on the ground. In response, the Solicitor General raised the specter of cross-border terrorism again and criticized the Petitioner and Intervenors for acting like ostriches with their heads in the sand. He also launched ad hominem attacks against the Petitioner and Intervenors and sought an explanation about why they did not approach the Court when internet was suspended in Kashmir for 3 months in 2016 after the death of Burhan Wani.\nAs internet services continue to remain suspended in the Kashmir Valley, we hope that a substantive hearing on merits will take place on 5 November 2019. The Government\u0026rsquo;s approach so far has been vaguely citing \u0026ldquo;national security\u0026rdquo; and delaying effective adjudication of the dispute by refusing to disclose any relevant or specific information. Without access to specific information about actual incidents threatening sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State or public order, it would be difficult for the Petitioner and Intervenors to demonstrate the unreasonable and disproportionate nature of the restrictions. Therefore, the Court must direct the Government to at the very least provide aggregate facts and figures about the ground reality in different districts of Kashmir and the burden should be placed upon the Government to prove how each piece of relevant information which is being withheld can threaten national security.\nImportant Documents  Additional Affidavit dated 23.10.2019 filed by State of Jammu and Kashmir (link)  Roti, kapda, makaan and internet?

The Quint on October 14, 2019 in a press report by Shushovan Sircar informed that residents of Kashmir holding postpaid connections were given access to their connections after a communication shutdown that lasted over two months. However, although these voice calling facilities were made available, the only way users were able to make use of their subscriptions were if they cleared payments worth two months of shutdown. Further, an update to the report informed that as a ‘special gesture’ Airtel waived postpaid charges for specifically Airtel Thanks customers only.\n  \u0026ldquo;Airtel to Waive Aug-Sept Dues in Kashmir as ‘Special Gesture’\u0026rdquo;\n  In light of this targetted application of the waiver, we write to the DOT on the need to provide regulatory directions to ISPs on the waiving of fees charged during the communication shutdown in order for it to be carried out uniformly across service providers.\nIn our submission we urge the DOT to direct this waiver on the basis for two reasons:\n Force Majeure: The communication shutdown is a Force Majeure event where users should not faced with charges levied for services they were unable to use during exigent circumstances. There has been sufficient coverage of the significant amount of economic, physical and mental suffering the residents of Kashmir have experienced and the inability to make user of their subscriptions until they clear payments only furthers this as it continues to disconnect them from their friends and families. Past practices: In September 2014, Jammu and Kashmir endured severe floods where as per a press report in the Economic Times, affected the delivery of communication services. In response to this, BSNL waived charges period it was unable to provide services much like the current situation. While this sets a good standard, with no direction provided by the DOT to this effect once again creates varying practices amongst ISPs.  The waiving of such charges should not even be an ask but a given.

However, during the proceedings, the Madras High Court had actually dropped the original prayer for Aadhaar linkage and shifted its focus to identifying the originator of information on end to end encrypted platforms like WhatsApp. Tamil Nadu’s Surprise Move: After initially arguing against the transfer, the Attorney General who was appearing for Tamil Nadu said that the State Government was withdrawing its objections to the transfer petition. In light of this, the Supreme Court allowed the transfer petition and directed it to be listed after mid January 2020.  If there is a Lock, must there be a Key? The Attorney General who was appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu began the arguments by saying that Section 69 of the IT Act, 2000 and Rule 13 of the IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption) Rules, 2009 impose an obligation on intermediaries to decrypt. The Division Bench of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. agreed that decryption was possible and the Government was empowered to seek it because “if there is a lock, there must be a key.” However, there was some confusion regarding whether the intermediary had an obligation to decrypt or if it had an obligation to provide assistance to law enforcement for decryption.\nNeed for Judicial Restraint Amidst this, Mr. Shyam Divan, who was the Senior Advocate appearing for IFF, pointed out that the constitutionality of Section 69 and the Rules had been challenged by IFF in another writ petition seeking surveillance reform and the matter was pending adjudication (Read more here). He further cautioned the Court against making any observations regarding encryption or the proposed amendments to the IT (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 because these issues have a major impact on the privacy and free speech of millions of Indians. He urged the Court to exercise restraint because any incidental observations made by the Court may be misconstrued as a justification to impose disproportionate restrictions on fundamental rights. He also highlighted that the scope of a transfer petition is very limited and the merits of such complex issues cannot be discussed at this stage.\nMan in the Middle Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, who was the Senior Advocate appearing for Facebook, stated that WhatsApp could not decrypt private messages shared on its platform because the key required to decrypt the message was only available with the user, and not with WhatsApp. He stated that the obligation under the IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption) Rules, 2009 was to provide assistance with decryption to the extent possible and it was not an absolute mandate. He further argued that while some of the parties such as IFF were pro-privacy and others like the Government were anti-privacy, social media companies were caught in the middle because some users want their communication to be private and secure while others want the police to have more powers to investigate cyber crimes.\nPlot Twist After initially arguing against the transfer, the Attorney General informed the Court that he had received new instructions and the State of Tamil Nadu was withdrawing its objections to the transfer. Due to this new-found consensus, the Court allowed the transfer petition and directed it to be listed after mid January 2020. In its affidavit filed yesterday, MeitY has stated that the proposed amendments to the IT (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 will be notified by 15 January 2020, and the Court decided to wait till then to let the executive branch address this complex policy issue first.\nImportant Documents  Written Submissions dated 22.10.2019 for IFF (link) Affidavit dated 21.10.2019 by MeitY (link)  We defend your privacy against both Big Brother and Big Tech.

Within no time, we received a response that an investigation was being conducted on the issue. New update: With almost two months since the incident, we thought it was necessary to check-in with the NPCI to enquire about the action and outcomes taken after the security breach.  Background On 30.07.2019, media reports and various user complaints brought to light an issue that caused the automatic registration of unified payments interface (UPI) based IDs of Truecaller users without their knowledge and consent. We wrote to NPCI indicating concern and suggesting immediate and intermediate action (read more) and they informed us of two steps they took in response, firstly, that they had stopped onboarding new Truecaller users on the UPI Platform and secondly, that they started an investigation on the incident.\nKeeping us in the loop Not to talk their ears off (and yours), we basically asked them to provide information on insights and the outcomes of their investigation. Its important that the public be made aware of the reason for this security breach especially as it pertains to their own data. This also brings a level of accountability to platforms like TrueCaller to ensure that put the rights and protection of individuals first.\nAdditionally, we reiterated two of our previous interim steps that indicated the need for a complaint redressal mechanism and the importance of architecture documentation in the public space to enable concerned individuals identify vulnerabilities.\nLinks to important documents\n Follow-up representation to the NPCI dated 14.10.2019 (link) Response by NPCI dated August 6, 2019 (link).

It has put out a call for feedback on a report created on this issue and a consultation it intend to have at the end of October. IFF gets on board: To contribute to the report and the consultation, IFF submits a few of its concerns and recommendations on privacy and gender and personality based on the work it does.  Background The report the Taskforce created analyses submissions and research on the varying impact of privacy on individuals with different orientations, genders, sexuality etc. This report was circulated to receive feedback from various stakeholders across the public and private sectors of Member States, human rights institutions, NGOs, individuals, civil society and researchers in order to conduct an international public consultation.\nThe consultation looks to check if gender based issues that arise in the digital era have a distinct impact on the existing right to privacy as we as individuals understand it. India is growing in its exposure and awareness to gender/personality matters and we hope that there has been sufficient representation of these issues such as the newly introduced Transgender bill etc., in this consultation by various organisations deeply involved and with greater expertise. IFF is privileged to have had the opportunity to share our comments and recommendations on the reportin addressing increasingly significant concerns based on our learnings in our line of work.\nOur Concerns We cover aspects of the report that complement IFF’s core areas of work in this field of digital rights and would prove useful in understanding the Indian landscape with regard to privacy. Here are brief pointers of a few concerns we highlighted.\n Imbalance in accountability: The need for smaller platforms to be more \u0026lsquo;woke\u0026rsquo; in their approach toward addressing content that is abusive/discriminatory based on gender, caste, orientations considering the sectional diversity of India. In the guise of women\u0026rsquo;s safety: Although done with the claim to increase the security of women, we highlight how large scale deployment of CCTVs combined with Automated Facial Recognition Systems is dangerous with no data protection law in place; especially pointing out the amplification of existing bias that such surveillance systems bring about. Unknown and unchecked software: In light of the Chinmayanand scandal (Read about it here), the use of an application to secretly film an individual has seen the light of day. We express concern about the use of such unknown applications used to target unsuspecting individuals that do not conform to India conservative societal norms. Community data: As the current atmosphere begs the need to demonstrate worries with this concept, we inform that the understanding of community data includes data that is anonymised or e-commerce data. This indicates that this type of data is irrelevant data, which is an incredibly incorrect assumption. If anonymised data can be re-identified and put to use, our submission emphasizes that publicly available data can most definitely be damaging; and with sufficient access and manipulation can once again attack minorities of both class and otherwise with the current raging biases in India.  Our two-cents Although we provide recommendations for each of our concerns, our broader suggestions largely focused on engaging with local groups to gain perspective on the impact of privacy on individuals from different walks of life. This conversation is extremely necessary to inform work being done by the UN Special Rapporteur as most groups lack capacity to contribute to such formal processes.\nWe are appreciative of this initiative by the Office of UN Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy taskforce and we hope that our submission has contributed a better understanding of these issues.\nLinks to important documents\n Submission to the UN Special Rapporeur on the right to privacy (link).

Two journalistic bodies- Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union- had intervened in the case to support press freedom in Kashmir. Secret Orders: At today\u0026rsquo;s hearing, the Government cited national security concerns in response to the Petitioner\u0026rsquo;s and the Intervenors' demand for disclosure of orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules. However, the Court has directed the Government to either produce the orders or file an affidavit stating why these orders must be kept secret.  Government files vague and conjecture filled response At the previous hearing on 1 October 2019, the State Government had filed its response in court, and the Central Government filed a brief response endorsing the stance taken by the State Government on the same day.\nOn the legal basis of the communication shutdown, the State Government\u0026rsquo;s response merely stated that \u0026ldquo;in view of the apprehension of misuse of data services, which is likely to cause deterioration in law and order situation requests were made, to service providers, from time to time, keeping in mind different zones/areas as per the threat perception prevailing at that particular time, by Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Zone, Srinagar, which were confirmed by Principal Secretary to Government of Jammu and Kashmir, Home Department in terms of Rule 2(1), first proviso, of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017.\u0026quot;\nAs evident, the response filed was extremely vague and relied on conjectures instead of providing concrete facts and figures which would enable the court to evaluate the \u0026ldquo;reasonableness\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;proportionality\u0026rdquo; of the communication shutdown under the Constitution.\nPetitioner and Intervenors seek production of actual orders To prevent further delay in effective adjudication of the case, the Petitioner and the Intervenors sought production of actual orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules. These orders are crucial because Rule 2 of the Telecom Suspension Rules requires that any order issued by the competent authority must contain reasons. In addition to the orders, the Intervenors also sought information about whether these orders have been reviewed and approved by a State Level Review Committee in accordance with the Rules.\nDuring today\u0026rsquo;s hearing, the Solicitor General strongly objected to the orders being disclosed to the Petitioner and the Intervenors citing \u0026ldquo;national security\u0026rdquo; concerns. In response, Mr. Dushyant Dave, who is the Senior Advocate appearing for the Foundation for Media Professionals, said that unless the government produces the orders, the Petitioner and the Intervenors are being forced to argue this case with their hands tied behind their back. Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, who is the Senior Advocate appearing for the Indian Journalists Union, emphasized that the Government cannot make an omnibus statement and it must demonstrate how disclosure of each order can threaten national security.\nAfter hearing both sides, the bench granted the Government time till the next hearing to file a sur-rejoinder. The government will have to either produce the orders at the next date of hearing or file an affidavit explaining why these orders cannot be disclosed. The next date of hearing in the case is 24 October 2019.\nSecret orders undermine Rule of Law Transparency in governance is the bedrock of Rule of Law. The Indian Supreme Court recognized this as early as 1951 when Vivian Bose J. noted \u0026ldquo;The thought that a decision reached in the secret recesses of a chamber to which the public have no access and to which even their accredited representatives have no access and of which they can normally know nothing, can nevertheless affect their lives, liberty and property by the mere passing of a Resolution without anything more is abhorrent to civilised man.\u0026quot;\nAt the next hearing, we sincerely hope the present Supreme Court will continue this tradition of requiring the government to adopt a culture of justification rather than a culture of authority where citizens are not allowed to demand concrete reasons for violation of their rights. As always, we will keep you updated about how the case progresses.\nImportant Documents  Application to bring on record additional documents filed by FMP (link) Application for production of orders filed by FMP (link) Affidavit filed by the State of Jammu and Kashmir (link)  Don\u0026rsquo;t want India\u0026rsquo;s vibrant democracy to turn into a Kafka novel?

Recently, we wrote to BSNL once again based on insights provided by IFF\u0026rsquo;s pro-active supporters. New update: BSNL provides another response to an RTI we filed in August on which shed some light to some of the processes they apply while they admittedly engage in code injections.  Background The code injections by BSNL dialogue has been going on for a while now, so here\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a timeline to make things slightly clearer.\n In May, we came across a report through our online reporting tool at savetheinternet.in and futher research on other social networking platforms and discussion forums of browser injections by BSNL permitting advertisements, on non-HTTPS sites. We wrote to BSNL informing them but also providing sufficient evidence of various instances (Read here for more). In July, with no acknowledgement from BSNL, we conducted our three pronged approach where we wrote to the DOT, filed an RTI on BSNL and also filed an incident report with CERT-In. This is where it got interesting, we received a response to our BSNL RTI claiming that the code injections contain no malware, but acknowledging the existence of such code injections nonetheless (Read here for more). In September, with the support of IFF community, we were informed that these injections continue to exist so we wrote to the DOT filling them in on the BSNL\u0026rsquo;s intentional code injection activities (Read here for more).  Update numero Uno The RTI we filed when we informed you of our three pronged approach, was forwarded to a few other CPIOs, which is why we have recently received another response to our queries.\n The first reply was on August 8, 2019 where BSNL claimed that no malware is being injected, however, admitting to the insertion of injections as we explained in our previous post. The second reply we received is a line by line response on September 12, 2019. 1. First, we asked for information on BSNL enagagement in the insertion of browser injections or code injections to which they claimed \u0026lsquo;commercial confidence\u0026rsquo; and providing such information would harm BSNL\u0026rsquo;s competitive position. 2. Second, we asked for reasons for the use of browser or code injections. They say that they rely on such activities to communicate with customers on available offers and useful information like Parental Control Guidelines. 3. Third, we requested for copies on file of action taken by BSNL in addressing complaints. BSNL claims that if they receive complaints via mails, they enable the their \u0026lsquo;DND\u0026rsquo; mechanism after confirming and collecting User Ids. 4. Lastly, we asked for physical copies on the file of action taken but as the queries are being received by email they do not maintain any physical files.  Update numero Dos Going back to our previous three pronged approached, we had filed an incident report with CERT-In to which we received no response. However, we have seemingly made enough of a push with our recently filed RTI to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology which enquired on the action taken by CERT-In in response to our incident report as the ministry has responded to RTI informing us that CERT-In has written to BSNL on the issue and is awaiting a response, which is a definite win!\nOur next steps: Is your privacy being sold? As BSNL has been more than clear about their commercial benefit from their code injection activities, the advertisements can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be injected without BSNL deriving some value, we have filed a new RTI enquiring on the streams of revenues being made through these code injections.\nWe are also considering further advocacy actions and examining what may be the best way to approach the Department of Telecom. As always, we will make sure to keep you updated with any further information.\nNote: This may seem like a small problem to those who live in cities where there are multiple options of ISPs, but BSNL in certain parts of India is often the most viable method of internet access. Specially for large parts of our government offices. We are especially worried for their cyber security, privacy and productivity that is often compromised by these ads.\nLinks to important documents  Second response to our RTI filed with BSNL (link)  Code injections ruining smooth browsing?

IFF filed RTIs with various State High Courts and the Central Government to check compliance with these directions. Zombie killer or nah?: We analyse the RTI responses to find that while most of Courts have complied with the order and even circulated it among respective district courts, there continues to exist some lag in compliance by the executive. Data reveals that while advisories were sent during the case, no advisories have been sent after.  Background Last year, armed with research that confirmed continuing prosecutions under the unconstitutional Section 66A, we informed you about our collaboration with PUCL who took this data to court (Read here for more). The outcome of this litigation led to the Supreme Court directing that all High Courts and District Courts, Chief Secretaries and Director Generals of Police around the country should be provided copies of the Shreya Singhal judgement.\nResponses received from High Courts To check if the High Courts had complied with the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions, IFF filed RTIs with various High Courts with these queries:\n Directions of the Supreme Court: Whether any direction was received from the Hon’ble Supreme Court or the Central Government to disseminate copies of the Shreya Singhal judgement to all District Courts and to provide details and content of any such correspondence. Dissemination of the High Court: Whether copies of the Shreya Singhal judgement were sent to all District Courts under the Court\u0026rsquo;s jurisdiction and for details and content of the correspondence.  Our findings were pretty positive. Most of the Courts both received the directions of the Supreme Court and also complied with the order to disseminate the judgement further to District Courts within their jurisdiction. Here are our findings in brief:\n High Courts that have received the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s directions and circulated the copy of the order: Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Patna, Uttarakhand. High Courts that we\u0026rsquo;re waiting to hear from: Andhra Pradesh, Chennai, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Orissa, Punjab and Haryana, Telegana, Madhya Pradesh.  Responses received from the Central Government The Central Government’s response to our RTI application reveals that Chief Secretaries have not been informed about the Supreme Court’s order dated 15.02.2019. In its RTI response, MeitY has provided details of correspondence sent to Chief Secretaries in December 2018 and January 2019 but no advisories have been issued after the Supreme Court’s order on 15.02.2019.\n_The impact of this lapse is grave and obvious. T_his plays into one of the main points an IFF supported research paper identified, the issue of signal failure. This direction merely requires functionaries to ensure compliance but does not specify any means of doing so, nor does it provide for any penalties in case of non-compliance, essentially placing no accountability of compliance on anyone.\nWhile we are appreciative of the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s order, in the granular view of things in order to ensure a complete purge of Section 66A prosecutions, there needs to be a more proactive way to monitor compliance. Even though the signal gaps seems to be smaller, unless we have data from each District Court and police station, the scourge of 66A will not be removed even today.\nA prototype \u0026lsquo;zombie tracker\u0026rsquo; we have been working on with Civic Data Labs, show that there are fresh case registrations in Maharashtra and we fear that many more cases still pending across the country.\n  \u0026ldquo;A mock up of an early alpha version of the, \u0026ldquo;Zombie Tracker\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo;\n  IFF is committed to erasing Section 66A from FIRs (first information reports) and court dockets to the best of our ability.

We have written to the DOT and MEITY multiple times informing of the persistent blockings but there continue to be no reasoning provided nor action being taken for such blockings. Where is the legal basis: We write to the ISPs highlighting the illegality without Court or Central Government orders and violation of Unified License conditions.  This is the legal framework. This week we sent a legal demand to ISPs to review and unblock websites. Yes, that includes your favourite service providers like Airtel, BSNL, Jio and Vodafone. In our legal notice, we make clear the current legal framework that permits website blocking as we explained in our previous post (here and here). To recap, there are three ways:\n Through court orders; Through directions of the Central Government subject to certain conditions under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000; Through directions by the Department of Telecommunications to Internet Service Providers under Clause 7.12 of the Unified Access License in the nature of public interest or under Clause 38.1, to prevent transmission of obscene content.  We continue to emphasize on the opaqueness of this process. Very rarely are there any reasons for blocking of a website made available to the originator of the information or the general public who may want to access the website. Apart from a standard notice which is sometimes not even uniformly displayed across ISPs, there is little clarity both in terms of notice being provided or even the legal basis for the same, so we call them out on this in our legal demand.\nYes, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about porn In our previous post we set out at length that there exist only three legal orders for blocking porn in India (read more here). We noted in it that, \u0026ldquo;The third court order which is publicly accessible was passed by the Uttarakhand High Court in a suo moto writ petition (WP PIL No. 158/2018). In this case, the Uttarakhand High Court had directed blocking of pornographic websites mentioned in a notification by DoT dated 31.07.2015. However, DoT has clarified that out of the 857 websites mentioned in the notification, ISPs were only required to block those websites which hosted child pornography. Further, the final order dated 07.12.2018 in this writ petition disposed the matter after referring to an existing case in the Supreme Court, Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India (WP Civil No. 177/2013).\u0026rdquo; Since, this case was disposed there is little to no legal basis to sustain any interim directons which may have been passed by the Uttrakhand High Court to block porn websites in India (read more here).\nLack of legal basis We highlight the number of website blockings reports, of especially popular websites such as IndiaKanoon, Reddit, SoundCloud, Telegram and various pornographic websites such as PornHub that IFF receives through an online reporting tool at www.savetheinternet.in.\nWe explain in two points how there is no justification for such arbitrary website blocking that cannot be done pro-actively by ISPs.\n Court ordered blocking: The persisting wide-spread ban on pornographic websites seemingly finds legality in a direction by DOT dated 31.07.2015 which used the list of 857 pornographic websites produced by the Petitioner in Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India (W.P. Civil No. 177 of 2013). We have pointed out that the DOT subsequently issued a clarification to ISPs stating that only those websites that hosted child abuse content were required to be blocked. The Uttarakhand High Court initially ordered blocking of websites mentioned in the DOT notification dated 31.07.2015 but during the hearing, the DOT clarified that it had issued another notification requiring ISPs to only block websites featuring child porn. The Uttarakhand High Court made note of this clarification and disposed the case. Violation of license conditions: The amended Unified License terms made on the recommendations of the TRAI on net neutrality prohibit any discriminatory treatment of content and blocking has been very clearly included in sub-clause iv(b) with the exception of court or government orders, which once again is not in effect.  The sole exception IFF has a clear position against child porn and any abuse related imagery where we hold a clear view that pro-active blocking by ISPs is a permissible action but needs to be done with post-decisional transparency and regular checks to ensure that this exception does not become the rule. We inform that even as per the 2011 Report of the UN Special Rapporteur in para 18, notes that child abuse content is a clear exception to the justification of blocking measures subject to the effective safeguards in place to prevent abuse of such restriction.Therefore, with no Central Government/Court ordered blocks, there is no reason for these blocks.\nUnder who\u0026rsquo;s authority? As you can clearly see, there is no legal justification for such arbitrary and unwarranted blocking and no clarity in case there are Central Government orders. We write to the ISPs with three requests:\n Conduct an internal legal review: We believe many websites have been blocked in India by ISPs historically without any clear legal basis as on date. There may have been historical reasons which are invalid today. For instance any interim directions in a case before the Uttrakhand High Court which was disposed off. Hence, the interim orders for blocking do not hold good any longer. __ Provide legal reasoning: To provide the legal basis under which the continued blocking of pornographic websites such as PornHub and the recent instances of IndianKanoon, Reddit, SoundCloud, the Telegram domain, and Playboy. Provide clarity: If there are Central Government orders restricting access to certain websites, we ask that they made available to the public in order to provide users with clear reasons for such blocking to ensure it does not portray that arbitrary blocking by ISPs are conducted.  We have continuously emphasised on how website blocking is one of the clearest forms of net neutrality violations if done by ISPs pro-actively and without a clear direction of Court or by Government Authorities as per law. We will keep working tirelessly on the need for the enforcement of net neutrality through adequate mechanism to pro-actively monitors, reports and provide users with a well established redressal process to address violations. Until then, we will continue to engage with the Government and ISPs institutions to ensure there is clarity and legality in website blockings.\nLinks to important documents and posts\n Notice to ISPs on website blocking (link) Why is porn being blocked in India (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/whattheblock/","summary":"We put ISPs on notice for illegal website blockings.","title":"The dirty secret about website blocking in India... #WhatTheBlock"},{"content":"  Highlights\n Background: Two journalistic bodies, Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union had filed intervention applications in Anuradha Bhasin\u0026rsquo;s petition challenging the communication shutdown in Kashmir. Both interventions were allowed by the Supreme Court in today\u0026rsquo;s hearing. Legality of Shutdown: After almost two months, the State of Jammu and Kashmir has filed an affidavit stating that the communication shutdown was ordered under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017. However, actual copies of the orders have still not been produced.  Court allows Intervention by Journalist Bodies In today\u0026rsquo;s hearing, a 3 judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices N.V. Ramana, Subhash Reddy and B.R.

The intervention applications emphasized on the watchdog function performed by the free press and highlighted the debilitating impact of the communication shutdown on journalists. The intervention applications also raised concerns about the legal basis of the communication shutdown being unknown because as on the date of filing, there were no orders authorizing the shutdown available in the public domain.\nAfter almost two months of the communication shutdown, the short affidavit filed by the State of Jammu and Kashmir in court today has finally shed some light on the legal basis of the shutdown. The affidavit states that telecom services were suspended pursuant to orders passed under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 by the Inspector General of Police which were subsequently confirmed by the Principal Secretary, Home Department. According to the affidavit, the communication shutdown was intended to prevent \u0026ldquo;dissemination of iniquitous and specious rumours, fake propaganda, misusing social media sites and for preventing activities that could disturb public order and tranquility.\u0026quot; However, the actual orders and specifics regarding when and where they were imposed are still not available.\nFor detailed live tweets of today\u0026rsquo;s hearing, check out these threads by Vakasha Sachdev (The Quint), Bar and Bench and Live Law. The next date of hearing in the case is 16 October 2019 subject to confirmation by the court\u0026rsquo;s order which will be available later in the day. The Petitioner and Intervenors have also been granted liberty to respond to the State of Jammu and Kashmir\u0026rsquo;s affidavit.

Previously, the MHA had disclosed the Standard Operating Procedure followed by the Central Government in IFF\u0026rsquo;s constitutional challenge against Section 69 of the IT Act and Rules made there under. Lack of transparency: With the notable exception of Bihar, none of the other states have disclosed copies of their Standard Operating Procedure. Similarly, only Andaman \u0026amp; Nicobar and Puducherry have provided information about total number of interception requests.  A few months ago we informed you about a Standard (we called it Secret) Operating Procedure disclosed in the Counter-Affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in IFF\u0026rsquo;s constitutional challenge against Section 69 of the IT Act and Rules made there under (Read more). This SOP saw the light of day for the first time when it was made available by the MHA before the Supreme Court. The lack of accountability, penalties or any kind of safeguard in place as indicated by the Central Government\u0026rsquo;s SOP made us wonder if other state governments were following suit or were up to something on their own.\nResponses received from state governments For this, IFF has been hard at work physically (unfortunately, the internet goes only so far) filing RTIs with almost every state in the country to understand the procedural safeguards under which state level surveillance may occur. Our queries were:\n If a Standard Operating Procedure or similar document has been issued or adopted by the State Government for handling interception requests under the Indian Telegraph Act or the Information Technology Act or its Rules. If there was a Standard Operating Procedure, a copy of it was requested. The number of orders/requests made under Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009 from 2009 till date.  We received responses from various states and union territories that we filed RTIs with. While we were very excited about what we might find, nothing too controversial has surfaced yet. Here are our findings in brief:\n States that follow the MHA SOP: Andhra Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar, Daman and Diu, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry States that have not issued an SOP: Assam, Delhi, Kerala, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura States that have claimed confidentiality: Chandigarh, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana States that have provided copy of their own SOP: Bihar States that have provided number of orders/requests: Andaman and Nicobar: Since 2013, 10 interception requests were made. Assam, Daman and Diu: No information with the IT Department. Bihar: Records are destroyed under Rule 419A. Delhi, Nagaland and Uttar Pradesh: Claimed confidentiality. Himachal Pradesh: Records are periodically destroyed and not made public for security reasoms. Kerala and Meghalaya: No interception orders have been passed. Puducherry: 5 requests have been made for interception of telephone calls.  Analysis of Bihar\u0026rsquo;s Standard Operating Procedure As you can see, the responses are pretty standard apart from the state of Bihar, which we were most curious about. The SOP appeared to be an exact copy of the MHA SOP. However, a closer look at their SOP showed only minute yet interesting differences, most of which were largely related to designating a more suitable authorised security and law enforcement agency within the State.\nUnlike the MHA SOP, the Bihar SOP provides for an Internal Evaluation Committee to be constituted which has to prepare a bi-monthly report on requisitions made for interceptions and monitoring. What stood out in Bihar\u0026rsquo;s SOP is the requirement for \u0026lsquo;total target numbers proposed\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;outcome of the interception\u0026rsquo; both of which are not part of the MHA SOP. It is impressive to see that Bihar has created and disclosed its own SOP. Unfortunately, certain aspects of our queries were not answered due to the destruction of records under Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules.\nWhile this is extent of information we have as of now, as always, with further responses from the remaining states, we\u0026rsquo;ll be sure to provide updates.\nImportant Documents  RTI responses from various states (link) Copy of Bihar\u0026rsquo;s Standard Operating Procedure (link)  Just as curious as us about state \u0026lsquo;secrets\u0026rsquo;?

Union of India from the Madras High Court to the Supreme Court because there were multiple cases pending before different High Courts which involved the common question of whether social media accounts should be linked with Aadhar. However, the Madras High Court has clarified that it is no longer considering Aadhar linkage and its focus is on facilitating cooperation between the police and social media platforms to find the originator of unlawful content. Policy making is the job of the executive: The Supreme Court emphasized that the Government was best suited to formulate policies about technical and complex issues such as encryption. The next date of hearing is 22 October and the Secretary of MeitY has been directed to file an affidavit about the status of the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules.  Importance of Access to Justice In today\u0026rsquo;s hearing before the Supreme Court in Facebook\u0026rsquo;s transfer petition seeking transfer of Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India from the Madras High Court to the Supreme Court, extensive arguments were made by the parties on whether technical and complex issues involving encryption should be addressed by the judiciary.\nOn 23.09.2019, IFF filed its response to Facebook\u0026rsquo;s transfer petition and reiterated that while it believes such problems should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government, the Supreme Court should not curtail the jurisdiction of High Courts to entertain writ petitions by ordinary Indian internet users against large multinational tech companies. Ordinary Indian internet users residing in different parts of the country should be allowed to approach their State High Courts if their fundamental rights are violated by Big Tech because most Indians do not have the resources to initiate litigation in the Supreme Court. While we believe that the prayers in Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India are misguided and strongly oppose any attempts to weaken encryption, it is also important to preserve access to justice for aggrieved citizens.\nSupreme Court Proceedings During today\u0026rsquo;s hearing, the bench once again inquired about the status of the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules which have been in the pipeline since December 2018. The Counsel for the Central Government clarified that the policy formulation process was underway and \u0026ldquo;special suggestions\u0026rdquo; were being sought to revise the Rules. However, he stated that a specific timeline for notification of the Rules could not be provided. The Bench comprising of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. noted that while misuse of technology is a serious concern, such technical and complex issues are best addressed by the executive branch.\nThe Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu insisted that WhatsApp was trying to avoid complying with Indian law by stating that it does not have the technology to identify the originator of information on its platform but this was not true since Dr. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras had provided a technical solution to enable tracing of originator. In response, Senior Advocate Mr. Kapil Sibal appearing for WhatsApp stated that another IIT Professor had disagreed with Dr. Kamakoti\u0026rsquo;s proposed solution. This was a reference to the expert report by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran from IIT Bombay that IFF had previously filed before the Madras High Court. Read more about it here.\nAfter hearing these submissions, the Court noted that such complex issues need to be decided in consultation with technical experts and the judiciary cannot be expected to implement such changes. The Court emphasized that while policy formulation was within the domain of the executive, any policy formulated by the government is subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it does not undermine the right to privacy. Since the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules are being actively considered by the Government, the Court adjourned the matter till 22.10.2019. It further directed the Solicitor General to file an affidavit by the Secretary of MeitY within 3 weeks about the status of the Rules and provide a definite timeline about when the process will be completed.\nIFF\u0026rsquo;s Stance Explained IFF\u0026rsquo;s Executive Director, Mr. Apar Gupta said the following about IFF\u0026rsquo;s stance in today\u0026rsquo;s hearing:\n \u0026ldquo;IFF represents Indian internet users and their fundamental rights, and not Big Tech. This requires us to take principled positions on what’s the best outcome possible in tough and complex situations. Ordinary internet users should have the ability to approach local judicial forums against Big Tech and will lack the financial capacity and resources to travel from remote places in India to judicial forums such as the Supreme Court of India at New Delhi. This is separate from our substantive position which we have explained and our stance has been taken after considerable deliberation and inputs from our external team of lawyers. Just like we have filed a technical submission opposing traceability in the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Madras High Court, we also opposed the transfer petition after receiving legal advice. According to us, it is best to contest the demand for traceability or social media regulations before the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court. The High Court judgement will of course be subject to appeal if parties are aggrieved and the transfer petition is dismissed. Ultimately foregrounding all of this is our defense of the standards of the Shreya Singhal judgement. This is why we recommend that such complex questions that rest on technical aspects of computer science should be settled by executive and legislative processes rather than through courts. Any such legislative changes or regulations are also similarly open to judicial challenge if they undermine fundamental rights.\u0026rdquo;\n The next hearing in the transfer petition is on 22 October 2019 and we will keep you updated about how this important case progresses. IFF was represented in today\u0026rsquo;s hearing by Udayaditya Banerjee, Ria Singh Sawhney and S. Prasanna, and we are extremely grateful for their continued support.\nImportant Documents:  Copy of IFF\u0026rsquo;s response to Facebook\u0026rsquo;s Transfer Petition (link)2.

IFF wrote to the members of the new Standing Committee about the need for greater transparency and public participation in its processes and highlighted substantive digital rights issues which require urgent attention. Valuable Forum for Engagement: Parliamentary Standing Committees can provide a valuable forum for citizens, experts and other stakeholders to make their voice heard in the legislative process. Since their recommendations are tabled before the Parliament, they also perform an advisory function and guide law making.  On September 14, 2019, the newly constituted Standing Committee on Information Technology was announced by the Government. The Committee will be headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor as its chairperson. The Committee comprises of 31 Members of Parliament with 21 from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha.\nWhy are Parliamentary Committees important? Parliamentary committees are vital aids to parliamentary and legislative processes through deliberations, interactions and debates amongst stakeholders to an issue. Raman Jit Singh Chima, co-chair of IFF provides a succinct explanation on the especially on Committee on Information Technology, \u0026ldquo;It plays a crucial role in holding government and other entities to account, opening up the policymaking process on technology issues to citizens and expert inputs, and using its power to call for hearings to also serve as a clear signalling function as to the approach the people of India wish on an issue.\u0026rdquo; (Read here for more).\nAt the conclusion of the year, the Committees even provide reports with findings and recommendations which are shared with the Government and tabled in Parliament providing advisory value. Apart from what it seems as entirely too procedural, the Committee is of incredible consequence as it helps hold the Government to account while also providing a platform through submissions or even hearings, for both industry and the public to engage on significant issues.\nA few suggestions. As this new Committee forms, we have taken the opportunity to write to them on three very particular issues:\n Transparency and accessibility: We highlight the need for further public participation through comments and also suggest that public depositions will enable better civic engagement and what better way to increase transparency than to begin telecasting proceedings. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be great to have public viewing of these Committees brainstorming? Unfinished homework: We point out the need to conclude matters deliberated on by the previous Committee such as the consultation on net neutrality and the need to safeguard citizen\u0026rsquo;s data online, to name a few, which are incredibly important issues that need clear outputs. What\u0026rsquo;s in store: With technology finding new ways to leave us befuddled, we suggest a few prevailing issues such as a legal framework for surveillance reform, the current state of free speech amongst many others, that need proper attention by the Committee.  We\u0026rsquo;re supremely excited to engage with the Committee in every way we possibly can and we hope there will be fruitful deliberation that will result in better governance of technology while putting the fundamental rights of the Indian citizen first.\nLinks to important documents  Letter to the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Information Technology (link)  Want to help us make the parliament a forum that expands rather than restricts digital rights?

Union of India (WP Civil No. 1031 of 2019) filed by the Executive Editor of Kashmir Times against the communication shutdown in Kashmir. The application for impleadment was filed by Mr. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, who is the President of FMP. In the impleadment application, FMP has argued that the communication shutdown and severe movement restrictions make it impossible for journalists to perform their duties as the fourth pillar of democracy.\nToday’s hearing happened before a three judge bench of the Supreme Court consisting of Gogoi CJ, Bobde J and Nazeer J. The hearing commenced with Bobde J wondering if the situation prevailing in Kashmir is a communication shutdown or breakdown and why telecom service providers have not approached courts despite their business being affected. The Court then stated that it was difficult for judges sitting in New Delhi to know the actual fact situation prevailing in Kashmir and that the J\u0026amp;K High Court might be better suited to perform this role. In response, Advocate for the Petitioner, Ms. Vrinda Grover clarified that due to movement restrictions, lack of public transport and shutdown of communication channels, approaching the J\u0026amp;K High Court has become very difficult.\nThe Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal stated that several newspapers in Kashmir have been able to publish their daily editions. Additionally, the Government has issued movement passes to journalists and set up a Media Facilitation Centre and internet kiosks. Senior Advocate, Mr. Shekhar Naphade who was appearing on behalf of the Indian Journalists Union clarified that the Media Facilitation Centre established by the Government was severely inadequate because it just had 4 computers, 1 mobile phone and extremely slow internet. More importantly, journalists were too afraid to use this government controlled facility because they feared that their emails could be intercepted, and this would put them and their sources at risk for harassment, retaliation and violence. Senior Advocate, Mr. Dushyant Dave who was appearing on behalf of FMP further highlighted that there have been disturbing reports of journalists being abused and mistreated in Kashmir and this is a matter of serious concern.\nThe Court finally directed the Government to file its response to the writ petition and intervention applications, and it urged the Government to selectively restore communication channels keeping in mind security considerations. Please note that this is subject to confirmation by the written order which will be made available in the evening. The next date of hearing in the case is 30 September 2019. IFF assisted with drafting and counsel coordination for the impleadment application filed by FMP.

This section was vague and lead to arbitrary arrests of young college students, a cartoonist and many other social media users. Hence, the judgement came as a huge relief. It meant that the unconstitutional Section 66A would not be able to used in future and even pending cases would be closed. But, this did not happen to our horror.\nThe problem is the implementation In a research paper lead by Abhinav Sekhri and co-authored by IFF\u0026rsquo;s executive director, Apar Gupta, it was demonstrated that Section 66A was being still used for legal prosecutions all over India (read more). This is unconsititutional and has clear harm to individuals who are accussed under it, the Supreme Court whose judgement is being flouted; even the creaky, overburdened criminal justice machinery from police stations to trial courts. To the authors this is a signal failure in which the judgements of the Supreme Court are not being implemented on the ground for ignorance and the absence of proper incentives. The question is, how can we fix this?\nEarlier this year we collaborated with PUCL (follow PUCL on twitter), India\u0026rsquo;s prominent human rights advocacy organisation that was also a petitioner in the Supreme Court in the Section 66A Case (read more). That resulted in a positive direction in which a copy of the judgement was directed to be sent to every district court and police station. This may not seem like it (after all, ignorance of law is not an excuse!), but was a radical step. As per many RTIs we have filed over the past few months, this judgement has indeed been dispatched to district courts all over India.\nBut the question, and the suspicion remains. Are Section 66A cases still being prosecuted? Are fresh ones still being filed? The answer to this is yes, and yes, as is demonstrable through the recent prosecutions of Priyanka Sharma in West Bengal and Prashant Kanojia in Uttar Pradesh (read more here).\nWe will not give up? #ChallengeAccepted To completely fix this we have come up with a tech-dev solution in partnership with CivicData Labs (check them out here). It will primarily query any fresh Section 66A cases on a monthly basis providing not only research insight but the basis for future advocacy actions to completely eradicate it from police stations and court rooms in India. We have called this the \u0026ldquo;Zombie Tracker\u0026rdquo; and submitted it for the Agami Challenge.\nWe will be working in collaboration with CivicDataLabs to query, analyse and publish (we are at the same time considering concerns around the right to privacy and those of the accused) large data sets and have also been able to build a rough prototype at present. They have allready built a prototype of a digital dashboard from court data in Maharashta. But at present this is just like a concept car displayed at trade shows. It needs to be properly tested, amended and deployed for maximum impact.\nThe components of the proposal for the Zombie Tracker (click here) – all details including the work flow, the various technical aspects, a detailed budget with costs but also challenges and mitigation strategies – have been fully and transparently disclosed and made publicly available. We invite further feedback on it! Our larger hope is to build an innovative model in which a tech tool, components of storytelling and advocacy all three work together as a strategy toolkit for the enforcement of constitutional judgements.

This is an issue that has been a part of self-censorship code discussions and even court litigations which have been dismissed owing to the positive stance taken by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on the matter.\nTherefore, in light of this invitation put out by the MIB, we have written a representation with a few suggestions and concerns on establishing methods of certification of online video content:\n Open consultation: With no formal communication of a consultation, we have requested the Ministry that any consultation to take place, be conducted with transparency and open to public feedback. Concerns on the case being sub-judice: The issue had been previously disposed off by the Delhi High Court in the W.P. (C) 1164/2018; the reasoning used by the Court has also been basis of dismissal in other cases (W.P. (C) No. 7123/2018). As we mentioned in our previous post, the Delhi High Court had re-iterated the adequacy of the Information Technology Act, 2000 especially in light of the affidavits filed by both the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. We also mentioned how any change in policy as per the introduction of certification might impact the pre-existing stand of government departments in an active litigation. Censorship and effect on Freedom of Speech: We have expressed the harmful effect on the freedom of speech and expression, innovation and user choice and also referenced our concerns submitted earlier on the \u0026lsquo;Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers\u0026rsquo; by the Internet and Mobile Association of India.  Our continuing concerns are on the resulting large-scale censorship that will ensue. This will impact curator and user freedoms creating a similar practice to the current film and television broadcast industry. It is the diversity, creativity and artistry portrayed through the online viewing platforms that a growing number of Indians prefer the this booming medium of choice.\nWe continue to suggest that the existing concerns that imply censorship through certification as a solution can be adequately addressed by market based mechanisms and existing penal provisions which are in any instance harsh and contemplate long jail terms on conviction. As always, IFF will continue to advocate for the Freedom of Speech and the facility to create artistic and innovative content for curators and also the ability to enjoy the same by enthusiatic users.\nLinks to important documents  Representation to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (link)  Certain that Certification and Censorship needs to Cease?

While restrictions have been eased in the Jammu region, the Kashmir valley continues to remain under clamp down with internet and cellular network services suspended. On 19 August 2019, a young Kashmiri student based in Bangalore moved to the Karnataka High Court to challenge the complete communication blockade as violative of fundamental rights of residents of Kashmir and their loved ones living outside the State.\nThe Petitioner was forced to approach the High Court because he had been unable to establish contact with his family members in Kashmir. He was especially worried because many of his family members suffer from various health problems and due to the communication shutdown and strict curfews, it has become difficult to call for help or reach hospitals in time. The Petition argues that the complete communication blockade violates Articles 14, 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution of India and it is incompatible with India’s obligations under international human rights law. Most importantly, the Petition highlights that the communication shutdown seems to lack any legal basis because there is no order authorizing the suspension of telecom and internet services which is available in the public domain.\nAs a constitutional democracy, what sets India apart is our stated commitment to the rule of law. While imposing such severe and indiscriminate restrictions on an entire community, the Government must at the very least act in a transparent manner. Without access to the legal orders, it is impossible to know under which law the shutdown has been ordered, on what grounds, by which government authority, for what period of time, and whether it has been subjected to any kind of review.\nThere have been three hearings in the case so far on 27 August, 30 August and 3 September. The crux of these hearings has been the maintainability of the Petition in light of a similar petition filed by Mr. Tehseen Poonawalla being pending before the Supreme Court. During the hearings, the counsel for the Petitioner has clarified that this case is different because the Petitioner is personally affected by the communication shutdown. Further, High Courts in India have independent and concurrent powers to protect fundamental rights of individuals within their territorial jurisdiction. To us, this is also an access to justice issue because an aggrieved person cannot be compelled to travel all the way to the Supreme Court in Delhi to seek constitutional remedies.\nInternet Freedom Foundation along with Ms. Maansi Verma assisted in drafting the Writ Petition and provided inputs on strategy and policy. The Petition was filed and argued by Mr. Vishwajith Sadanand and Mr. Ravi Varma Kumar and we deeply appreciate their support. While at the moment, IFF does not have the capacity to be a full fledged legal clinic, we do take on this role whenever there is a serious violation of rights of internet users in any part of India. This Petition is part of our larger advocacy against internet shutdowns which are a pan-India problem. Internet shutdowns cause great hardships because ordinary people cannot access many government benefits and essential services such as banking without the internet.

On August 24, 2017, the Right to Privacy was identified as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India by a nine judge bench of the Supreme Court. The declaration of privacy as a right has had manifold impact not only affecting direct issues of data protection but even larger areas of mass surveillance and personal aspect such as the right to one\u0026rsquo;s own sexuality.\nThe Right to Privacy is very close to our hearts, it has been one of IFF\u0026rsquo;s core issues and we have consistently been working to ensure the same for citizens of India. Our fight for privacy has persisted since the introduction of the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 with submissions to public consultations, RTIs requesting transparency and disclosure, advocating for privacy through intrusive government schemes such as CCTVs and facial recognition systems and most recently, the tabling of the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code, 2019 in the Lok Sabha aided by the wonderful Dr. Ravi Kumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu). This is only the beginning.\nWe will work with all institutions of governance and also continue to challenge them to do better, to continue to work towards ensuring an individual\u0026rsquo;s right to privacy is put first and foremost.\nIn light of this journey as country, IFF due to the partnership and support of Mozilla will celebrate today with an event that will feature talks and a conversation with Justice B.N. Srikrishna. This will be to the benefit to a cross section of stakeholders and we hope bring varied perspectives such as on gender and criminal justice that are an integral parcel of privacy right.

Independent expert submission by IFF: IFF has filed an independent expert submission by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran (Professor of Computer Science at IIT Bombay) which highlights the risks and long term ineffectiveness of Dr. Kamakoti\u0026rsquo;s proposal to introduce traceability on encrypted platforms.  What happened before the Madras High Court? After the closely watched hearing of Facebook\u0026rsquo;s transfer petition before the Supreme Court (read more about it here), the PILs filed by Antony Clement Rubin and Janani Krishnamurthy were listed for hearing on 21.08.2019 before the Madras High Court. Earlier at the Supreme Court, a division bench of Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice Aniruddha Bose had refused to stay proceedings before the High Court but they also directed the High Court to not pass any effective orders. In light of this, at today\u0026rsquo;s hearing, the High Court could have either adjourned the matter till the transfer petition was decided by the Supreme Court or it could have continued with the hearings. The High Court decided to adopt the former approach and adjourned the matter till 19.09.2019 after charged arguments by senior advocates representing Facebook and the State of Tamil Nadu. While adjourning the hearing, the High Court clarified that it was no longer considering the original prayer to link Aadhaar with social media accounts, and instead, its focus was now on improving coordination between law enforcement agencies and social media companies. Despite the adjournment, the case before the High Court is at a crucial stage. At the last hearing on 24 July, the High Court had directed Dr. V Kamakoti, who is a Professor at IIT Madras to submit a technical report on methods to trace originator information on WhatsApp. Dr. Kamakoti submitted his report on 31 July in which he has proposed two methods to identify the originator of a WhatsApp message. In our previous submission to the High Court, we had highlighted the impact of Dr. Kamakoti\u0026rsquo;s proposal on the fundamental right to privacy, particularly for whistleblowers, activists, journalists, abuse survivors and other individuals belonging to marginalized groups who are at highest risk of violence and harassment if their identity was disclosed.\nExpert submission by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran We also had certain concerns about the technical aspects of Dr. Kamakoti\u0026rsquo;s proposal and these were the main focus of our submission filed yesterday. We had reached out to Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran who is a Professor at IIT Bombay specializing in cryptography to provide an independent expert analysis of Dr. Kamakoti\u0026rsquo;s proposal. We are extremely grateful to Dr. Prabhakaran for taking time out to evaluate the technical effectiveness of the proposal and his report was submit to the High Court as a part of IFF\u0026rsquo;s affidavit. In his report, Dr. Prabhakaran has noted that in its existing form, the proposal suggested by Dr. Kamakoti is vulnerable to falsification of originator information by bad actors to frame an innocent person for sending an illegal message. Dr. Prabhakaran has suggested use of digital signatures to mitigate the risk of spoofing but his analysis ultimately concludes that even with these modifications, the long term effectiveness of the proposal is very limited.\nDr. Prabhakaran\u0026rsquo;s report was submitted in addition to IFF\u0026rsquo;s earlier reply and our latest affidavit which clarifies our organizational stance that any attempts to weaken encryption through backdoors or key escrow systems would undermine the privacy and security of all users. All of this has only been possible because of the fantastic work done by our counsels, Suhrith Parthasarthy and Surasika Parthasarthy, who have been representing us before the Madras High Court and ensuring that fundamental rights of Indian internet users are given due consideration during these hearings.\nImportant Links1.

This case has gained such importance due to the spectrum of issues no longer being limited to Aadhaar and social media linking, and it has also brought within its ambit big companies such as Facebook, Whatsapp, Google etc.\nOn August 13, the Supreme Court of India proceeded to hear a petition put forth by Facebook to transfer the case pending before the Madras High Court to the Apex court. The matter was adjourned, to be heard on August 19 but it was pushed once again to August 20 with continuing suspense on whether the case would be transferred, keeping everyone on edge especially with the next hearing in the Madras High Court scheduled for August 21.\nToday, the case was listed as Item No. 13 in Court No. 13 before a division bench of the Supreme Court with Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Justice Deepak Gupta and Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Justice Aniruddha Bose, and the hearing continued for over 45 minutes. Arguments made were not purely limited to the transfer prayed for by Facebook but also included substantial arguments on encryption and the linking of Aadhaar. However, the judges made it clear that at this stage, the Court was only concerned with whether the petitions should be transferred and not with substantive merits of these cases. The Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court agreed to examine these aspects as it issued notice to the respondents in the petition. While it did not restrain the Madras High Court from continuing hearings, it did direct that it shall not give any final orders. The next date for hearing before the Supreme Court is September 13, 2019.\nArguments were made by Senior Advocates Mukul Rohatgi for Facebook, Kapil Sibal for WhatsApp and the Attorney General of India, K.K. Venugopal representing the State of Tamil Nadu. Issues of the existence of cross purposes in the relief claimed by cases in the Madras HC and the Supreme Court, the magnitude of the impact of this case on global products such as Whatsapp, and even examples of the Blue Whale challenge as a justification for identification of originators were voiced.\nThe next scheduled date for hearing in the Madras High Court is August 21, for which IFF will be present.

Users reported an indecipherable SMS sent out with a response later received through their banks alerting them to a UPI based registration. Both the official twitter handle for TrueCaller and representatives of Truecaller have indicated the issue to be the result of a “software bug”.\nTime to be accountable Truecaller has become a widely used service that does not only identify incoming calls from unknown numbers but also offers payments services through the use of UPI. This payment method is governed by the National Payments Corporation of India set up with the support of the RBI. In light of this, we write to the NPCI on the systemic deficiencies that need recognition and suggest steps in addressing security and data protection issues:\nImmediate steps: __\n Technical assessment: The NPCI should investigate this security breach and provide information on the bug but also on its impact to each user. Further steps include an audit of other payment platforms that utilise UPI.  Intermediary steps:\n Complaint and redressal mechanism: A complaint addressing mechanism with a structurally designated office and channels for redressal focused on data/privacy/technology issues, available to the users should be put into place by NPCI. In line with this, there is need for structure; Establish a working group for oversight: If not already in existence, in order to review security and data management practices through UPI, an independent working group should be created to conduct investigations, provide best practices for UPI and periodically review the platform, ecosystem partners. Architecture documentation: Public facing technologies need documentation of all aspects of the technology to create trust and establish norms on correct use. The working group should strive to put all architecture documentation in the public domain to help researchers determine if any such vulnerability exists.  While the concerns for such breaches of user consent, security and data continue to loom, all hope is certainly not lost! With the support of such enthusiastic rights oriented individuals, civil society organisations and even cooperative companies, user rights and protections will triumph.\nIFF as always, will continue to ensure your digital rights bloom in this gloom.

These include the government selling vehicle registration data, introducing facial recognition technology and increasing CCTV surveillance. Unfortunately, all this is being done in the absence of any safeguards, principal amongst them is a data protection bill.

This is a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code which puts the interests of Indian citizens first.  Parliament gets a modern, progressive legislative proposal August is coming! And that makes it a full year since the consultations on India’s data privacy regime were held. More than two years after the epoch defining right to privacy judgement a data protection regime seems distant. Meanwhile, surveillance grows in scope, sophistication and creep.\nSince the consultations in August, 2018 there has been little movement on the Personal Data Protection Bill. But there has been a lot of activity on projects which pose massive threats to privacy (read more on it here)!

Two of these court orders were passed by an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Mumbai and the third order was passed by the Uttarakhand High Court. No pro-active blocking of porn by ISPs: We can reasonably infer from MeitY’s response that ISPs have not been directed by the government to proactively block porn websites, and they should not be doing so in the absence of a specific court order. Hence, legally there is little or no basis for proactive blocking.  The mystery behind the Porn Ban In India, viewing sexually explicit material in private spaces is not illegal. Then why are porn websites being blocked? Many of our supporters have pinged us about this issue, so we got down to first diagnosing why this is happening before coming up with solutions, if any, that this may require.\nFirst, let’s start with the basics. In India, there are three ways to block a website. First, a website may be blocked pursuant to a court order. Second, a website can be blocked pursuant to directions of the Central Government under Section 69A of the IT Act. This is usually done by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Department of Telecommunication (DoT). However, the Central Government cannot directly block websites for merely hosting pornographic content because obscenity or morality is not a ground for blocking websites under Section 69A of the IT Act (remember the controversy surrounding blocking of Savita Bhabi? Read more about it here). Finally, the DoT can also issue specific directions to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) under the Unified Access License to block websites in public interest (Clause 7.12) or to prevent transmission of obscene content (Clause 38.1).\nTo get to the bottom of this issue, we filed RTIs with both MeitY and DoT. Our RTI filed with DoT was transferred to MeitY, and the response from MeitY revealed that porn websites have been blocked in India pursuant to three court orders passed from 2016 to 2018.\nNon-availability of court orders Unfortunately, out of the three court orders cited by MeitY, only one order is publicly accessible and we have filed a first appeal with MeitY for a copy of the other two orders. Two of the three court orders were passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate of the Esplanade Court in Mumbai in 2016 and 2017. While we could not access copies of these two orders, the information available on the E-Courts website suggests that 500 websites were blocked in a single day based on a complaint by the cyber police department without providing any hearing to the owners of these websites.\n  (Screenshot from the E-Court website showing that the order passed by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate from Mumbai has not been uploaded by the court.)\nThe third court order which is publicly accessible was passed by the Uttarakhand High Court in a suo moto writ petition (WP PIL No. 158/2018). In this case, the Uttarakhand High Court had directed blocking of pornographic websites mentioned in a notification by DoT dated 31.07.2015. However, DoT has clarified that out of the 857 websites mentioned in the notification, ISPs were only required to block those websites which hosted child pornography. Further, the final order dated 07.12.2018 in this writ petition disposed the matter after referring to an existing case in the Supreme Court, Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India (WP Civil No. 177/2013).\nInterestingly, the RTI reply side-steps two other cases, Kamlesh Vaswani v. Union of India and In Re: Prajwala (SMW Crl No. 3/2015) which may have led to blocking of websites that feature child porn or videos of sexual violence. However, to the best of our knowledge, these cases have not led to any directions for blocking of pornography websites more generally.\nISPs should not block porn pro-actively The acronym \u0026ldquo;ISP\u0026rdquo; expands to Internet Service Providers, not the Internet Service Police. The legal position is clear and they should desist from proactive filtering and blocking practices.\nMoreover, the information received by us gives rise to a reasonable inference that the Government is not issuing directions to block porn unless it is child pornography. To us, this means that there are no existing directions for pro-active blocking of obscene content by ISPs, and they should not be doing so without a specific court orders directing them to block individual URLs. Finally, we recognize the concerning psychological impact of porn production and consumption but we do believe that when viewed privately, it falls within an individual’s right to free speech and privacy. This certainly does not include pornography which has minors present in it, or is created in the absence of consent. To make and view pornography belonging to both these classes is not only a crime, but a deep moral stain that results in long lasting physical and mental harm to the participants who are exploited for its production.\nWe acknowledge that the ethics of mainstream porn production, particularly the portrayal of women and other minorities, merit study and examination. There have been notable attempts by Point of View, Centre for Internet and Society and Centre for Communication Governance to promote a better understanding of online pornography through conferences and reports, and we hope there is greater conversation on the issue. At present, we maintain that pornography production requires greater diversity and strict enforcement to ensure absence of trafficking and labour protection. These are issues beyond the scope of our expertise and we look for leadership from feminist and sex workers’ rights organisations who are best suited to take the lead on this issue. We will listen and learn. At the same time, IFF will do what it does best, which is fight for internet freedom and the choice of individual internet users in India. This includes the private consumption of content that is deemed obscene under antiquated, colonial laws which should not find space in modern, progressive India.\nImportant Documents:  RTI response received from MeitY dated 08.07.2019 [link] RTI query sent by IFF dated 30.05.2019 [link]  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/why-is-porn-being-blocked-in-india-whattheblock/","summary":"RTI response from MeitY reveals that blocking of porn in India is a result of three court orders and ISPs have not been directed to pro-actively block porn websites.","title":"Why is porn being blocked in India? #WhatTheBlock"},{"content":"As some of you may remember, the Madras High Court had permitted IFF to intervene in an ongoing public interest litigation regarding linking of Aadhaar with social media accounts.

This case is extremely important because the Hon’ble High Court is considering a wide remit of issues, and not just Aadhaar and social media linking. These include encryption, intermediary liability and use of automated tools to take down illegal content.\nThe outcome of this litigation could lead to a change in the product design of major social media platforms because law enforcement agencies want the Hon’ble High Court to direct these companies to devise a mechanism to trace the originator of a message. In this regard, a specific proposal has been made by Dr. V. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras to include the phone number of the originator of a message whenever a message is forwarded.\nIn its written submission to the Hon’ble High Court, IFF has emphasized that any restrictions on the use of social media platforms must be proportionate and they should arise from a deliberative and consultative process that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders. We have highlighted how changing the product design of social media platforms to include the phone number of the originator of the message would undermine the freedom of speech of internet users. Anonymity is an important part of freedom of speech because otherwise, individuals would be too reluctant to discuss controversial subjects in the public domain. The right to anonymous speech is especially important for whistleblowers, abuse survivors, activists and others belonging to marginalized groups who may face harassment if their identity was disclosed.\nWhat happened at today’s hearing? Today, senior legal counsels appearing for WhatsApp and Facebook made extensive arguments on the central point of traceability. On our part, we filed and placed a substantive response which addresses a broad range of issues which have arisen including concerns regarding digital surveillance, encryption and content takedowns. During oral arguments, based on submissions made by the lawyers for social media platforms, the Hon’ble High Court expressed the view that it may even examine the existing level of compliance and legal vacuum under the IT (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules.\nProf. Kamakoti’s technical inputs which formed part of the Government’s common report have been directed to be filed by the Hon’ble High Court. This promises to be interesting and we will respond to it. The next date of hearing in this case is 21 and 22 August 2019.\nImportant Documents  IFF’s submission in response to the Government’s common report (link)  Don\u0026rsquo;t want every message you send to be fingerprinted and tracked?

Immediate need for a Data Protection Framework:**** We wrote a representation to the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Minister for Electronics and Information Technology asking on the status of the much awaited Data Protection Bill. More importantly what it will look like and why it should be made public prior to it\u0026rsquo;s introduction in parliament. Thank you parliamentarians: We also wrote to close to ten parliamentarians for not only opposing the Aadhaar Amendment Bill but asking for a rights focused data protection law.  Running out of time but never out of slime - new and improved ways to threaten your personal data With great power, comes great responsibility. The stream of new technologies continuous to remind us of the various ways we are currently left vulnerable only solidifying our need for a data protection law.\nIn light of this, we wrote to Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad on the immediate need for a data protection law (Read here for more).\nRight now India is under a privacy onslaught. This comes from several government policies and programs. Here are a few select ones:\n1. Facial Recognition: On June 28, 2019, the NCRB released a call for tender, inviting bidders to provide Automated Facial Recognition Systems (AFRS) with the intention of creating a repository of “crime and criminal facial data”. The RFP for AFRS is alarming; it furthers critical privacy violations large-scale surveillance and also discriminatory profiling.\n2. CCTV: Delhi has recently had the “privilege” of installing over 1.4 lakh CCTV all over the city with the intention of providing security to women. The project is itself illegal as it has no statutory basis to substantiate the violation of privacy under Puttaswamy v. Union of India. In addition, there is an absolute lack of transparency in the manner in which this project is advancing but questions of the protection of the storage, accessibility and security of such footage continues to remain answered.\n3. Social media linking: To add to the dynamic nature of our current concerns, an order was released by the Indian Higher Education Secretary asking students to link their social media accounts to all higher education institutes (HEI) as well as the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (HRD) without regard for the privacy of students and its impact on their freedom of speech and expression.\n4. National Economic Survey: While an entire chapter in the survey has been dedicated to purely data, the approach is extremely concerning. Following the narrative set by the Draft National Economic Policy, it treats data as a public good which is at the disposal of the Government to be used in a manner it deems fit. This understanding is fundamentally incorrect as it does not recognise that ownership should remain in the hands of an individual.\nThe Draft Personal Data Bill has still not made its way to Parliament. In addition, there is no transparency on the actual content of the Bill in its current form (Read our post on this). As we emphasised in the representation, India appears to be settling in quite well within the definition of a digital dystopia.\nIt is with these chilling concerns that we reach out to the Ministry on the immediate need for the Data Protection framework, one that is fully rights respecting rather than a mere after-thought. The current Draft Personal Data Protection Bill should maintain its earlier standard and its framework needs to be disclosed in order to ensure that the approach to data as is in proposals such as the Draft National E-Commerce Policy and the National Economic Survey do not make individuals data a “public good” relinquishing the individual of control of their own data. We have requested that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology proactively engage and ensure the essence of a data protection law as is in several other jurisdictions is maintained.\nWe will continue to engage with all forms of Government in ensuring India receives a data protection legislation that puts it citizens first!\nImportant documents  Representation to Shri.

Need for established safeguards: The proposal to introduce facial recognition into society currently comes with a variety of concerns that need to be addressed first. We write a legal notice to the NCRB with also a covering letter and a copy of the notice to Home Minister, Shri. Amit Shah and Home Secretary, Shri. Rajiv Gauba, highlighting the features and scope of the AFRS and its unfathomable detriment it could bring about to Indians if implemented.  Know your enemy Its important to understand the characteristics the Request for Proposals requires the systems to possess, in order to understand how problematic it will be. Our legal notice highlights features which will be covered here in brief to provide basic context.\n Function: The AFRS is intended to be a repository of all crime and criminal related facial data and should be able to identify or verify a person from a variety of inputs ranging from images to videos. Integration: The system should be able to be integrated with various other databases such as ICJS, CCTNS, IVFRT, state police integration software in existence or any others. The integration does not stop there, it requires the system to be compatible with other biometric solutions such as Iris and AFIS but doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify what these databases are. Might we have yet another Aadhaar worry to add to our frown lines? Identification: As per requirements of the RFP, the system should not only be able to match images from a variety of databases, it should also be equipped to capture images from CCTV footage, public or private video feeds. As concerning as this sounds, there\u0026rsquo;s more. It should also have the ability to tag images uploaded from newspapers, raids, sketches etc. with identifiers based on sex, age, scars, tattoos, consider landmarks, features and contours in identifying individuals and also accommodate for images with plastic surgery and make up for accuracy in identification. Technical requirements: The aspects that stuck out in the RFP largely related to the need for the system to be compatible with bio-metric solutions such as Iris and Fingerprint identification systems. It also requires there that there be security in storage, user access and authentication Security requirements: The bidder is largely responsible for additional measures in maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data that will be stored, apart from the established ISO standard prescribed in the RFP.  Here\u0026rsquo;s why we aren\u0026rsquo;t quite ready for sci-fi We take a closer look at these not so frightening features and identify concerns with the entire technology itself.\n Absence of legality: The requirement of facial recognition systems does not stem from a statutory basis nor is it a result of the executive power of the Government. Clearly it lacks any sort of legal backing. This is in addition to the violation of privacy it will so flagrantly undermine as it fails to fulfil any of the elements laid down by Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 (10) SCALE 1) in permitting a violation of privacy. Manifest arbitrariness: Beginning to picture the massive invasion of privacy the AFRS will potentially have? Especially with its all seeing eye looking at not only databases and databases of images but also strategically located CCTV footage, images of newspaper clippings, raids, sketches etc., all most likely without your knowledge. This kind of en-masse surveillance is bound to bring about a high degree of damage. Studies by MIT and Georgetown and trials conducted the London Metropolitan Police acknowledge that pervasive biases that exist currently within our societies are likely to be mimicked by the algorithms within these systems. Mis-identification and discriminatory profiling is the result we\u0026rsquo;re looking at if these systems are implements. Apparently, the already existing discriminatory practices perpetuated by human beings is no longer enough, we must look to AI to continue our dirty work. Absence of safeguards and accountability: In light of the above, there is currently no legal restrictions or limitations to this technology to ensure its proportional use or afford protection to those it interacts with. Add facial recognition to the on going debate on CCTVs and we have ourselves a full fledged mix of India and China no longer being restricted to the Indo-Chinese cuisine.  Considering the trajectory India appears to be on with mass surveillance and technological perpetuating of discrimination, a scarier version of the Orwellian dystopia seems to be right up our alley. We urge the NCRB to take a step back and recall the bidding process for the Automated Facial Recognition System until adequate safeguards that address these various concerns are put into place. This request is also with a disclaimer that failure to do so may cause us to seek remedy in accordance with the law.\nImportant Documents:  Request for Proposals by the National Crime Records Bureau for Automated Facial Recognition Systems [link] Legal notice to the National Crime Records Bureau [link] Covering letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Home Secretary of Home Affairs [link]  All your black mirror nightmares coming true?

Most of the cases involve allegations of copyright infringement related to movies. We are making a copy of this response with the text of these orders available. BSNL has only revealed court orders but refuses to provide any directions received from the Central Government for blocking of websites and we will be filing an appeal with the CIC regarding denial of this information. Lack of Due Process: Our analysis of the court orders reveals four disturbing trends. First, the court orders permit blocking of the entire website, and not just specific URLs which host IP infringing content. Second, courts have passed the buck to ISPs to determine whether blocking websites listed by the plaintiff is necessary to prevent copyright infringement without independently verifying if these websites host infringing content. Third, interim injunctions are granted to block access to websites without providing the website owner an opportunity of being heard. Finally, Ashok Kumar orders which were intended to gather evidence against unnamed defendants are being misused for website blocking.  Perseverance Pays Off (Partly) After a long drawn process, BSNL has provided IFF access to court orders directing blocking of websites in 2017 and 2018. We had filed two RTI applications with BSNL on 6 March 2019 seeking information about website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and different courts. Both RTI applications were initially rejected by citing the existence of a fiduciary relationship under Section 8(1)(e) and threat to life and safety of a person under Section 8(1)(g) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. We appealed the rejection of our RTI requests, and we were partly successful because BSNL agreed to provide us access to court orders. However, it has refused to disclose website blocking orders issued by the Central Government and we intend to challenge this before the Central Information Commission (CIC) soon.\nAnatomy of a Website Blocking Court Order We were provided access to 31 court orders in total. Out of these, 25 orders were passed by the Madras High Court and the remaining 7 orders were passed by the Delhi High Court. Almost all the court orders relate to unlicensed streaming of copyrighted films, TV shows or sports events on websites such as 123 Movies, Pirate Bay, Put Locker, Torrent etc. Approximately 3000-4000 websites were blocked by each order but there is significant overlap in the websites mentioned by different orders.\nWe analysed all 31 court orders and discovered four disturbing trends.\n_(i) Whole websites, and not specific URLs are being blocked_All court orders relating to copyright infringement permit blocking of the whole website, and they do not limit suspension of access to specific URLs which host infringing content. The list of websites is prepared by the plaintiff with the help of paid investigative agencies and it is accepted by the court without any independent scrutiny.A notable exception to this trend of blocking whole websites is present in the solitary court order relating to trademark infringement which directs blocking of specific URLs selling infringing products on E-Commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a court would mechanically block access to the whole website of a multi billion dollar giant like Amazon. Unfortunately, file sharing platforms like Torrent which have been characterized as rogue pirates do not receive the same level of consideration.\n_(ii) ISPs forced to be Judge, Jury and Executioner_Most court orders passed by the Madras High Court put ISPs in a tough spot because they are directed to block websites listed by the plaintiff if it is necessary to prevent copyright infringement. This is unacceptable because ISPs are not capable of making such decisions which require application of judicial mind. Whether blocking a website is necessary to prevent copyright infringement will require the ISP to evaluate the genuineness and imminence of the threat vis a vis each website. Since ISPs do not want to waste their resources on individually verifying whether infringing content exists on the thousands of websites listed by the plaintiff, they will err on the side of caution and block access to everything. Further, there are several exceptions to copyright infringement such as fair use for educational purposes or criticism, and ISPs cannot be expected to balance competing interests to determine if the exception is applicable.\n_(iii) Ex-parte orders are undermining the adversarial basis of our justice system_Out of 31 orders in total, 21 orders were passed without any of the defendants or their representatives present. Therefore, there was nobody present during the hearing who could challenge the plaintiff’s version. This is deeply problematic because our justice system follows an adversarial model which believes in discovering the truth through contestation between opposing parties. In the cases before the Delhi High Court, there were four types of defendants: owners of named websites which are known to host copyright infringing content, owners of unnamed websites which may be hosting copyright infringing content but their identity is not currently known, ISPs and government bodies like Department of Telecom. However, plaintiffs who had filed their copyright infringement suits before the Madras High Court only impleaded ISPs as defendants. This means that owners of websites which are being blocked have not even been brought on record or served notice. If only ISPs are impleaded as defendants, then it is not a genuinely adversarial proceeding because as previously noted, ISPs are business entities which would prefer to err on the side of caution and they will not fight for website owners.\n_(iv) Ashok Kumar orders being misutilized for website blocking_For everyone who isn’t an intellectual property lawyer, an Ashok Kumar order is a court order which restrains a class of persons whose identity is not yet known from infringing the plaintiff’s rights. These orders are called John Doe orders abroad.\nThe difference between John Doe orders and website blocking orders has been explained by Ananth Padmanabhan writing for CIS:\n “The most crucial point of distinction between these two types of orders is that while John Doe orders speak to the primary infringer, website blocking orders impose onerous responsibility on the ISP. John Doe orders as used in India thus far have served the purpose of a blanket search and seize mandate to gather evidence of direct infringement. As seen above, the final relief in the suit is granted only against those John Does who are subsequently identified and arrayed as parties to the main suit. Website blocking orders, on the other hand, amount to granting the final relief at the interim stage itself, as access is blocked to web links hosted by unknown persons by taking recourse to the ISP.”\n In some of the court orders that we analysed, the judges have failed to appreciate this distinction, and they have put the cart before the horse by directing the ISPs to block access to any infringing website upon receiving notice of the same from the plaintiff. The ISPs are required to block access even if the owner of the website was not impleaded as a named defendant or mentioned in the list of websites provided by the plaintiff to the court.\nNeed for due process and proportionate solutions On our blog, we have previously written about problems in the website blocking process under the IT Blocking Rules. Most recently, we discussed this issue in the context of blocking of the satirical Dowry Calculator website for which we had also filed an RTI.\nOur analysis of the court orders supplied by BSNL reveals that even when websites are blocked by the judiciary, there is a lack of due process and natural justice. Website owners are not given notice or hearing before grant of interim injunctions. Further, court ordered website blocking is disproportionately broad because it is not limited to specific URLs which host infringing content. File sharing platforms also host legitimate content and cutting off access to the entire website is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\nThe most troubling trend is the concentration of power in the hands of ISPs who are expected to block websites which may or may not be mentioned in the plaint based on whether it is \u0026ldquo;necessary\u0026rdquo; to prevent infringement. This means that our fundamental right to free speech which is guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution is left at the mercy of overly cautious and business minded ISPs. As internet users, we are often left wondering why certain websites have been blocked because the notices displayed are cryptic and inconsistent, and they do not disclose reasons for suspension of access. This lack of transparency directly impacts our right to receive information which is also a part of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\nFiling RTIs has been an important part of IFF’s strategy to unearth information which concretely demonstrates lack of due process and transparency in the website blocking process.

We were deeply concerned with this development and decided to intervene. Intervention time:**** Given the relevance of these cases, IFF goes to Court for the 6th time, continuing its fight for the right to privacy of the citizens of India, amongst various other concerns. Our stand in court is to protect user privacy, prevent surveillance but also to address the harms and regulatory issues such as end-to-end encryption which are of concern to the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court. Rest assured, all our submissions are to advance digital rights and the constitutional values!  / Why we decided to intervene. Information is necessary for a well functioning society. However, it also carries power and creates social structures. For instance social media while making sure all of us remain connected is no longer merely a way to stay in touch. It has become a way of life and permits a wider functionality. This also carries risks and harms. Many social media platforms today are rife with abuse, misinformation and illegal content. It is undermining the demos of Indian democracy. A solution which has been posed in the Madras High Court is linking the real world identities (government ID\u0026rsquo;s such as Aadhaar) with social media accounts.\nConcerned by these developments, in early June, 2019, we filed two interventions in Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India \u0026amp; Ors (W.P. No. 20774/2018) and Janani Krishnamurthy v. Union of India (W.P. No. 20214/2018). This is in our continuing work in approaching and assisting courts all over India in matters related to technology and fundamental rights. In the hearing today, our intervention application was accepted by the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court of Madras. We thank our counsels Arun Karthik Mohan and Suhrith Parthasarathy for their representation.\n// Why linking Aadhaar to social media is terrible. Aadhaar being linked with our social media accounts? Here\u0026rsquo;s why we think this would result in a terrible outcome.\n Increased power of social media companies over users: It would undermine the right to privacy in several ways. At present we can only visualise a few, and as we very well know with technology based policy interventions, the outcomes are often much worse and the threats only multiple when user rights are not considered at the outset. For instance, it would allow social media companies to gather deeper, more granular information about their users. A government ID, especially one such as Aadhaar which has a common identifier would permit them to link the personal data on the social media platform more easily. This would result in more pervasive dossiers of social media users available to the highest bidder who can serve us then with ads across platforms. Not to mention it would also increase the harms to speech by chilling dissenting voices. Troubling legality: This also becomes troubling neatly on the legality of the proposal. As per us, the private use of Aadhaar remains problematic as indicated by the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court. This becomes incredibly dangerous when it is mandatorily linked to our social media accounts. All this is happening while we are still governed by deficient safeguards, that were devised for telephone tapping applied to digital surveillance by the government. In a related matter to reform the safeguards for government surveillance (which is at present occurring without any judicial oversight) we have made a constitutional challenge through a petition in the Supreme Court of India by filing Internet Freedom Foundation v. Union of India (W.P. (C). No. 44/2019) [Soon coming up for hearing on July 2, 2019]. Increased risk to minors and women: Linking real world identities may counter intuitively also contribute to the spreading of misinformation, abuse and threats which not only result in a direct attack against our democracy but also allows for individualised harms which more often come through to women and children. Women (other persons as well, especially individuals from vulnerable groups) in India quite often have adopted pseudonyms on social media to avoid censure from family, acquaintances or wider social judgement. Linking their Aadhaar to their social media accounts would tremendously increase informational risks even rising to the level of threats to their physical security.  /// A short statement on today\u0026rsquo;s developments IFF\u0026rsquo;s executive director, Apar Gupta stated that, \u0026ldquo;We are grateful to the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Madras High Court for permitting us to make submissions given the vexed issues of Aadhaar and social media linking. This was possible due to the submissions of our counsel Suhrith Parthasarthy who is advising and representing us in this case. He also indicated the larger issues before the court on which we plan to engage in future hearings. Given the pervasive use of social media in our lives and the existing tools to harvest and utilise data for marketing purposes, not to mention, individualised advertisements, the entire gathering of personal data itself has been a constant cause for concern in the law few years. Adding Aadhaar to this cocktail for the purpose of verification of identity would arguably create further harm. This case also concerns issues of online abuse, misinformation which can contribute to challenges to social order and when law enforcement is deficient, even violence. Hence, the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court has also in recent hearings been considering issues of intermediary liability and end-to-end encryption. On all these issues, IFF\u0026rsquo;s staff will work with care to ensure submissions are made to safeguard and protect the digital rights of every social media user in India.\u0026rdquo;\nIn continuance with IFF\u0026rsquo;s mission \u0026ndash; we will keep approaching courts in a systematic and planned manner to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights of every India.\nTransparency is a hallmark in all of IFF\u0026rsquo;s work.

While there have been several submissions, they were not made public. The Bill was not passed in the 2018 winter session of Parliament that it was initially introduced but press reports confirm it will be listed in this session of parliament. Need for transparency: As this Bill moves toward becoming law, concerns grow with the not only visibility of its current state but also with its pre-existing content. IFF writes to Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad emphasising the need for transparency.  Furthering the right kind of Privacy The public consultation that took place in August 2018 for the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, did not result with the submissions made by various stakeholders being made public. Essentially this defeats the purpose in providing information that would enable us to make better responses to any suggestions that would result in the dilution of privacy protections in India.\nIFF filed two RTI’s with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on October 16, 2018 to understand the purpose in maintaining such secrecy. We asked for information of those who made submissions to the public consultation and the content of the submissions and if anyone else that may have aided the process of drafting the law or reviewing the submissions. However, we only received the number of submissions to the bill which was a total of 624, without their actual text being made public while the second query was blatantly rejected on the unavailability of information with the concerned Central Public Information Officer.\nWhile awaiting responses to Second Appeals filed with the Central Information Commission, it seemed necessary to write to Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Shri. Ravi Shankar voicing our concerns (Read about it here).\nOur representation reiterates the need for transparency in the public consultation procedure. The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill will most definitely revolutionise the current state of the industry; this requires that the industry and various other stakeholders be made aware of the current state of the Bill that is intended to be passed by Parliament.\nIFF will continue to advocate for the privacy of the Indian citizens, the first step in this journey is to ensure compliance with the Pre-legislative Consultation Policy formulated by the Cabinet of Secretaries. We request that the procedure set by the policy involving at the very least a summary of the submissions provided.\nAs we hope our request is given due consideration, IFF continues ensure data protection and privacy moves to forefront as is needed in this day and age.\nImportant documents  Representation to Shri.

This timeline coincides with the proposed amendments to the draft Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2018.\nAll this may seem like dull, legal mumbo-jumbo (which it often is); however these legal changes and proposals has a real, direct and severe impact on your privacy. When we launched the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign we made a public commitment to you, to keep fighting to ensure it is protected and over the past few months we have kept busy serving it!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a few highlights to catch up with what we\u0026rsquo;ve been stirring:\n1. Public Engagement and informing analysis: We have continuously engaged not only through our submissions to public consultations but through our posts that summarise these issues with explainers.\n Aadhaar Amendment: We have been coordinating with our friends over at the, \u0026ldquo;Rethink Aadhaar\u0026rdquo; campaign. This includes spending time in devising strategy, lending resources, collaboration to increase visibility. Intermediaries Rules: Some proposed changes to these rules has will restrict not only your freedom of speech and expression but by measures such as breaking encryption, endanger your right to privacy (Read about it here). The Draft Personal Data Protection Bill: This proposed law may be introduced in the present session of parliament. It contains various gaps that need addressing before it is turned into legislation ranging from a number of exceptions provided to the Government to the lack of provisions that deal with surveillance reform and protection of children online (Read about it here). ********  2. Redrafting the Indian Privacy Code: This has been a hell of a lot of work! SaveOurPrivacy\u0026rsquo;s model code on privacy has undergone the process of a complete redraft. To ensure we do this well, we held a a roundtable with some of the best legal counsels and academics to ensure the code is equipped to address further issues of data protection, privacy and surveillance. We will be releasing this version publicly by the end of this week with an explainer.\n3. Fighting in the courts: In our fight against mass surveillance, we have challenged the surveillance practices of Government through a writ against the Ministry of Home Affairs (Read about it here). Parts of our work also included assisting in devising litigation strategy and coordination with the People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). More recently we sent a legal notice to the Delhi Government against the illegal CCTV project (read more about it here).\n4. Filing RTIs. Ensuring transparency: In ensuring we cover all grounds, we filed a number of RTI\u0026rsquo;s with the Central Government with queries on the Personal Data Protection Bill (Read about it here) and surveillance powers of the Ministry (Read about it here). We have filed many, many more RTIs and will be announcing our larger advocacy plan on using transparency to ensure that the surveillance powers of government are exercised with proper safeguards and judicial and parliamentary oversight!\nThis is definitely not the end of it. As we continue to carry these on, our plan towards protecting your digital rights in light of the impending passing of these proposals will fully rest on these themes.\n Positively engage all government institutions with optimism and courage: IFF will continue to engage with the Government and parliamentarians in order to urge the transparency prevails through the disclosure of the full contours of the Data Protection Bill to its introduction in Parliament. At the same time we will continue to fight in courts, send notices and file RTIs. Focus on interests of the individual as articulated by the fundamental rights of the Constitution of India: We will make every effort to ensure that any legal proposals or changes protect individuals like you! We will work tirelessly to ensure that each government programme, or private use impacting privacy is rights oriented by making sure dangerous proposals such as mandatory, indefinite data retention and breaking encryption as suggested by the Intermediaries Rules do not proceed.  Yes, we can do more, and have more impact! But, we cannot do this alone. We welcome all offers of collaboration and support!

The arrest of journalist Prashant Kanojia has brought back to the forefront a \u0026lsquo;jilted\u0026rsquo; provision amongst others that furthers the arbitrary and indiscriminate arrests of social media users. We join others in demanding his immediate release but are also further pressing for much needed policy and legal reforms.\nWith the formation of the new Government and our best foot forward, we write to Shri. Amit Shah, Minister of Home Affairs with a copy marked to Shri. Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology and Minister of Law and Justice.\nThe representation highlights the need for legal reforms in India to ensure freedom of speech and expression. With the continuously increasing number of Indians gaining access to the Internet, fear of unlawful prosecution and arrests only appear to be growing. This in all eventualities results in an incredible amount of self-censorship; a direction India seems to be moving towards similar to that of China. The repeal of criminal defamation and sedition is the need of the hour, more now so than ever before. Such a grand task can only be achieved with initiative by the Central Government of India to ensure momentum towards such reform.\nA few steps moving forward for both temporary remedies and long term reform have been suggested in the representation.\n  Immediate steps: Issue a detailed advisory to all State Governments cautioning against the use of criminal law to police free speech of social media users. Especially, arbitrary arrests.\n  Long-term systemic reform: Operationalise the Law Commission of India to spearhead a comprehensive media and speech laws reform project with public participation.\n  We are optimistic that the necessary steps will be taken by the respective ministries in addressing these issues.

Feeds from these will be made available to RWAs and Market Associations - without any safeguards! Infringing privacy, threatening women\u0026rsquo;s safety: The CCTV Project is completely illegal. It has no underlying legal framework or any legal safeguards. Even the bidding has been carried out in a secretive manner and our RTI for more information on it was deftly dodged by the Government. We put the Delhi Government to notice: Today we sent a legal notice after repeatedly bringing public attention to this issue through social media. In the instance the project continues, we will examine and undertake all steps available under law to fight and defend every person\u0026rsquo;s privacy!  The Delhi Government was for years, stuck in a battle with the Lieutenant Governor to install and fulfil its promise of about 1.4 lakh CCTV cameras in Delhi at the cost of 500 crore. The LG’s office had recommended the cameras be installed with the permission of the police, and drafted rules governing the use of CCTVs in Delhi.\nDisregarding this, on June 3, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced installation of the cameras would finally begin by June 8. This is a project which will infringe the fundamental right to privacy, is a waste of public money and worse, even can contribute to endangering women\u0026rsquo;s safety. Today we were constrained to send them a legal notice to halt the project immediately. Read on for more details.\nA secretive process For a project costing more than 500 crores and impacting the privacy of millions living and visiting Delhi, there have been no open public consultations inviting comments and suggestions on the rules governing such cameras. There has also been no cost-benefit analysis, and the entire tendering process was done without the bid documents and the scope of work being made publicly accessible.\nFor instance details of the project were also not provided through our RTI request and the Delhi Government incorrectly claimed that such details were already available in the public domain, when in fact, they were not (read the RTI request and the reply here). For the record the complete details were not made available on the PWD website and even the Standard Operating Procedure for thier installation and operation has not been published in a proper manner.\nAssualt on privacy Hard fought battles of getting and implementing privacy as a fundamental right are now at risk in Delhi, where lakhs of CCTVs will now record each and every movement of citizens. According to one survey conducted on this issue, 210 out of 250 or 84% of the respondent students were concerned about the CCTV footage being used for stalking and personal abuse.\nAs per the Supreme Court’s decision in the right to privacy case (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 1), the three core elements to gauge the legality of a privacy violation are, (a) legality; (b) legitimate state aim; and (c) proportionality. The CCTV project fails on all these three parameters. Also, for questioning Peters and doubting Thomases, several passages in the right to privacy judgement clearly hold that even information in public spaces has a privacy right attached to them.\nA voyuers dream, a stalkers paradise A one-page note providing the Standard Operating Procedure for such cameras makes the Resident Welfare Association nominee one of the primary custodians of the footage recorded. In the absence of any safeguards, this means that your local neighbourhood committee member can access and use any recordings collected from any cameras within the neighbourhood.\nIt can also lead to higher crime against women and issues of moral policing given that such unhindered, unregulated and liberal access to CCTV feeds will be provided to a unrestricted number of people. This will be done without any safeguards. When we say, \u0026ldquo;without any\u0026rdquo;, we mean absolutely zero.\nPutting the Delhi Government to Notice All of these points are set out at length in a legal notice we sent today to the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Delhi (Read the notice here) demanding for a halt to such installations, opening up the proposal for public consultations and the addition of adequate safeguards to protect the privacy and freedom of millions of Delhi residents. Today, we remind the Government that Orwell\u0026rsquo;s 1984 is work of fiction and caution, not an instruction manual.\nWe would like to thank Kritika Bhardwaj, Advocate, for her legal advice on this matter.

This paper will also aim to identify certain critical applications that could claim exemptions from current net neutrality principles.\nWhile we\u0026rsquo;re greatly appreciative of TRAI\u0026rsquo;s move to tackle net neutrality violations, we continue to relay our concerns in maintaining net neutrality as explained in our previous posts (Read here for more).

In addition, although the number of reports have reduced, our online reporting tool has received fresh responses of websites (Read here for more) being blocked since March 25, 2019. Here is a brief analysis.\n Streaming/VPN/Porn: Continued reports of blocking against torrent and streaming websites, VPNs, porn websites and reddit spread over a wide geography within India. Cryptocurrency/Cloud Storage: A recent addition has been reports of the blocking of cryptocurrency websites, the kickstarter website, cloud storage site \u0026ldquo;mega.nz\u0026rdquo; and Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s DNS Server. Throttling: Further, there has been throttling of speeds without the use of a VPN on BSNL. Apart from the regular ISP\u0026rsquo;s Jio, Act Fibernet and You broadband, wired connections such as Airwire, Spectra, Smartlink and GTPL have also engaged in blockings. Code Injections: While not malicious, there has been an instance of BSNL injecting advertisements into non-https websites.  We restate the urgency and necessity for taking positive action not limited to an enforcement mechanism but also to the need for transparency and disclosure regulations for ISP\u0026rsquo;s to ensure compliance with license amendments. Due importance to this needs to be given in the upcoming consultation process.\nContinuing with advocacy Today, we wrote again to the DOT marking a copy to TRAI pursues the issue further writing to the DOT informing them of the continued blocking.

With the election results coming in there are celebrations but also anxiety as to the strength of a mandate that can pose a challenge to individual liberties \u0026mdash; freedoms which increasingly interact and are determined by digital tools and technologies. We congratulate the results of this festival of democracy, which by no means was perfect but requires to be respected. We look forward to the next term of the central government which can advance digital rights as a priority.\nTo those who are fearful at this moment, we wish to reassure and stress on the importance of solidarity. We have been blessed to be in a country that promises us justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. These are values that are articulated by the Constitution, but they will not achieved by default but demand committed labour. IFF is here to serve this need.\nToday we draw lessons from Constituent Assembly speech by Dr B.R. Ambedkar on the 25th November, 1949 (PDF link). In his speech Dr. Ambedkar outlined with prescient clarity methods to hold power to account.\n  Strengthen constitutional methods: This means engaging and safeguarding institutions. This includes all our constitutional bodies. The legislature, judiciary and the executive; government in all its arms, such as the Election Commission or the Telecom Regulatory Authority. IFF intends to continue its engagement to ensure that our democratic traditions become stronger.\n  Focus on policy rather than a person: We continue to work on the substance of proposals, legislation, court judgements and executive orders. Promoting evidence based, participative and transparent frameworks for crafting technology policy. Victories on this will only be possible by making these materials engaging, comprehensible and participative for a greater number of ordinary, everyday Indians.\n  Strive for social democracy and fraternity: As per Dr. Ambedkar social democracy consisted of a trinity of, liberty, equality and fraternity. This holistic view is present in all our work and we deeply believe in his words that, “Fraternity means a sense of common brotherhood of all Indians-of Indians being one people. It is the principle which gives unity and solidarity to social life.”. Today is a day for unity and solidarity. Remembering the objectives of constitutional governance, as opposed to government being only an end in itself. Towards this we will keep engaging and building a community of passionate supporters and collaborating with activisits and civil society organisations.\n  IFF’s challenges may increase but we remain optimistic. With humility, we recognise the importance of our mission. The integration of technology will increase with our lives, beyond cities and towns into the villages and the distant hamlets of our vast and diverse country. At this moment, we would also like to clearly set out our funding model. We are a registered non-profit aiming to draw funds from individual giving by Indians. This is also being supplemented and being made sustainable by organisational donations.\nTo us, our funding philosophy is a powerful method for ensuring a level of democratic legitimacy in our work and priorities. It makes us responsive, accountable and transparent. It allows us to do work which carries an element of risk \u0026ndash; such as approaching courts and taking clear advocacy positions on digital rights with political parties.

We\u0026rsquo;re sure it caught everyone\u0026rsquo;s attention considering a meme was involved.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve explained the journey of 66A earlier, that, the Supreme Court in the Shreya Singhal case in 2015, declared it unconstitutional. However, after a study conducted showed pending cases of 66A still on the loose, People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties along with the study approached the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court once again. Victoriously, the Court ordered that copies of the Shreya Singhal judgement be passed on to all Courts, Prosecutors and Police Departments in India to bring about the necessary awareness of its unconstitutionality.\nHowever, not to despair, since we went back to court with PUCL, a skimming through the web and online legal databases do infact show an absence of pending 66A cases. To evidence the same, a case in the Patna High Court (CR. WJC No.72 of 2019), acknowledges the wrongful use of Section 66A in a detention order by the State Government and has required it to re-visit the matter in order to consider the correctness (Read the judgement here).\nWhile there has clearly been a drop in the presence of 66A, two recent instances have brought it back to the spotlight. We know, it\u0026rsquo;s been a grey-skied week, especially in Delhi as you\u0026rsquo;ll see a little later in this post.\nAdventures at the Supreme Court of India\nEvent I\nThe Supreme Court has had an interesting last week. Petitioner A. Siva Raman, filed a contempt petition (Conmt.Pet.(C) No. 618/2019) in the case filed by People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties asking the court to ensure the passing of the Shreya Singhal\u0026rsquo;s judgement, to which the Court with J. Rohinton Nariman and J. Vineet Saran, on May 10, 2019 issued notice (Read the order here).\nWhile we are not entirely aware of the reason for the contempt petition, it would be reasonably fair to infer that there has been a breach of the directions of the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s orders. As soon as we have more information, an update will be put out.\nEvent II\nIn West Bengal, a 25 year old woman named Priyanka Sharma, member of the Bharatiya Janata Party was arrested for posting a meme on Facebook. The meme was a picture of Chief Minister Mamata Bannerjee in place of Priyanka Chopra\u0026rsquo;s face at her appearance at the Met Gala. On the basis of a complaint by a member of the Trinamool Congress, an FIR was filed against her invoking the essence of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act as a reason, for which she was arrested. There is a lack of clarity as to whether the original charges emphatically quoted Section 66A itself as consistently reported by the media or merely imposed its effect within the ambit of Section 66 of the IT Act.\nApproaching the Supreme Court, the vacation bench of the Supreme Court immediately ordered her release by the West Bengal Government but along side stated that she apologise in writing once she was released. News reports indicate that before her release, Priyanka Sharma was forced to sign a written apology. While the Court may have tried to avoid implying the apology was pre-conditional to her release, it\u0026rsquo;s final order managed to convey just that. Bar and Bench has uploaded the application seeking directions from the Court for her release here.\nAlthough the closure report of the police in West Bengal indicated that it has no basis for the charges filed, the intention behind the purpose of using Section 66 was quite clear. The continued use of this provision has definitely been concerning especially after having gone to Court twice, however, it\u0026rsquo;s use finding a way through the guise of Section 66 calls for the need to be more vigilant in ensuring the essence of 66A no longer prevails.\nOnce again, IFF will continue to all that it can to uphold the right to freedom of speech and experience if every which was it possibly can.\nLink to important documents  Notice in the Contempt Petition filed by A.

A particularly interesting response also informed us of browser injections by BSNL. Need for security: BSNL\u0026rsquo;s disregard to the security of their networks is alarming given the sensitivity of the nature of information transmitted in these fields. We ask BSNL to take necessary recourse in addressing the issue.  Background In our previous posts, we introduced our online reporting tool to keep a record of Net Neutrality violations around India. One of the responses that stood out informed us of browser injections by BSNL permitting advertisements, on non-HTTPS sites. We decided to look into the issue further, which led to the discovery of numerous public complaints on social networking platforms and discussion forums of similar injections.\nVenomous code injections Techniques such as code injections are generally used to gain unauthorised access to systems, compromise the integrity and safety of sensitive data or deny access amongst other significantly detrimental consequences. After learning of its prevalence within the BSNL services, it led to concern not only the security of the information involved but especially the illegality of their actions, so we put it to the test against various frameworks in existence.\n  The Information Technology Act, 2000 Section 43 of the Act provides various protections to information that is within a computer resource, in order to maintain its integrity and security from unauthorised attacks. Hacking of a computer system deceptively, in such a manner, would even render one punishable by fine or imprisonment under Section 66 of the Act. Not only is injecting code done without the knowledge of the individual, its purpose is to undermine the vulnerabilities of the code to fulfil its own agenda.\n  Cellular Media Telephone Services Agreement As far as we could find, BSNL is governed by the provisions of Cellular Media Telephone Services agreement which specifies in clause 44.4 that the Licensee (BSNL) is to ‘ensure protection of privacy of communication and ensure that unauthorized interception of messages does not take place.’ Permitting such insertion of code definitely permits unauthorised interception of the original code which in all likelihood puts in jeopardy the security and protection of the privacy of the transmission. This is in clear breach of its own license conditions.\n  The Department of Telecommunications also circulated a notice providing for minimum requirements of security to be met by Licensee, in line with the DoT’s licensing conditions in May 2011. It specifically expects measures to be in place against intrusion of malware, protection of information in networks and its facilities, basic updated security measures in compliance with statutory, regulatory, licensing or contractual obligations. BSNL appears to be clearly failing to meet these requirements.\nSo we decided to write to BSNL stating exactly this; explaining how it is in contravention with a multitude of provisions (Read it here). In addition to this, we have also attached to this representation, a compilation of various reports of such code injections. Such thorough documentation has only been possible to the proactive users of India Broadband Forum, Twitter and Reddit (you guys have led us to some pretty intense discussion forums).\nWe provide BSNL with some necessary next steps, provided below, in not only addressing the issue but to provide some accountability for their lack of redressal over user complaints.\n Investigate: Formulate a working group to coordinate the legal and technological departments and then conduct an official audit, specifically investigating each reported incident and identify the reasons for its occurrence in different geographies. Disclose: Public disclosure of the findings of the audit and take the proportionate corrective measures. Fix: Take immediate actions in the interim as well as standing instructions which may be considered to prevent recurrence.  We are optimistic that BSNL will pay heed to our representation and take needed action. We do mention that in case of failure to do so, IFF fully intends to move forward with strategic steps to approach Government authorities including CERT IN and the Department of Telecommunication to bring awareness and the required response in strengthening existing security measures.\nLink to important documents  Representation to BSNL on Code Injections [link]  Ads making you mad?

To address such unjustified and opaque website blocking, we have filed an RTI application seeking reasons for blocking of this particular website and made a representation to MEITY for public disclosure of all blocking orders. Need for transparency: The existing Blocking Rules need urgent reform because they classify website blocking orders as confidential and deny aggrieved internet users an opportunity to challenge these orders before a court of law.  The curious case of the block on Dowry Calculator\nLast week, we learnt through Twitter (hat tip to Rohan Verma who brought this to our notice) that the Department of Telecom has blocked access to www.dowrycalculator.com. Dowry Calculator is a satirical website which allows people to calculate how much dowry a man would receive based on his age, caste, profession, salary, alma mater, height, skin colour etc. These criteria are the denominators of an asymmetric patriarchal system which perpetuates the social evil of dowry.\n  \u0026ldquo;Screenshot of contents of www.dowrycalculator.com\u0026rdquo;\n  Since then, we have monitored the twitter thread where some preliminary inferences from crowdsourced reports reveal that the blocking is inconsistently applied across ISPs in India. While Reliance Jio has blocked the website, it is still available through Airtel (though it is inaccessible on our connection on Airtel Delhi) and Vodafone.\nThe reasons for blocking the website are not known because the web page merely shows a standard notice stating that, “the URL has been blocked pursuant to direction of the Department of Telecom. Please contact administrator for more information”. This kind of inconsistency and opacity has now become characteristic of India’s website blocking regime. We have previously written about this trend of ISPs blocking not merely porn but also popular websites like Reddit, Sound Cloud and Telegram, and you can read more about it here.\n  \u0026ldquo;[Screenshot of the standardized post-blocking notice displayed on www.dowrycalculator.com\u0026rdquo;\n  Poking fun at patriarchy is not illegal\nDowry Calculator is the brain-child of journalist, Tanul Thakur, and this is not the first time it has been in the eye of the storm. In May 2018, Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted about the website and urged the Ministry of Woman and Child Development and the Prime Minister’s Office to take action against it. This, in turn, prompted Menaka Gandhi to request Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) to block the website. Even upon learning that it was a satirical website intended to mock men who demand dowry, Shri Jyotiraditya Scindia stuck to his stance. He argued that people might not realize it was satire and such serious problems should not be made the subject of a joke. You can read more about it here.\n  \u0026ldquo;Tweet by Jyotiraditya Scindia after learning that www.dowrycalculator.comwas a satirical website\u0026rdquo;\n  Satire is one of the most effective ways of holding up a mirror to society and speaking truth to power. It is often provocative and forces uncomfortable social conversations. The content on Dowry Calculator makes its satirical nature abundantly clear to anyone who goes beyond the surface and actually attempts to use it. For instance, when one tries to pick a skin colour, the options include ‘Pitch Black (Not visible on a Moonless night)’ and ‘Wheatish (Almost white. Would need some fair n Lovely)’.The website also states that it is “dedicated to all the match-making aunties of India.” While the content and framing of dowrycalculator.com, such as the absence of clearer labelling is a matter of debate, certainly it does not call for legal and technical censorship.\nIn light of all these elements which ridicule dowry seeking grooms and their families, it is difficult to see how any reasonable person who actually uses the website will believe that it promotes dowry. Unfortunately, Dowry Calculator has become the latest victim of the government’s outrage driven and unaccountable website blocking practices.\nOpaque legal framework for website blocking\nTo give you a background, in India, website blocking is governed by Section 69A of the IT Act and IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009.\nSection 69A empowers the Central Government to block websites in the interest of (i) sovereignty and integrity of India, (ii) defence of India, (iii) security of the State, (iv) friendly relations with foreign States (iv) public order, and (v) for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above. In the present case, the government has presumably relied on ground (v) but the idea that www.dowrycalculator.com incites men to illegally demand dowry is preposterous. However, ISPs are unlikely to resist the enforcement of such unreasonable blocking orders because non-compliance can be punished with up to 7 years imprisonment and/or fine.\nSection 69A is supplemented by the Blocking Rules which prescribe the procedure to be followed for blocking websites. The Blocking Rules establish a Committee for Examination of Request which is supposed to determine whether a website is hosting content prohibited by Section 69A.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of Section 69A and the Blocking Rules in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (WP No. 167 of 2012). However, its decision was heavily motivated by the provision for pre-decisional hearing present in the Blocking Rules. Theoretically, the Blocking Rules comply with principles of natural justice because reasonable efforts must be made to contact the author of the website and the intermediary hosting the website, and they should be given an opportunity to make a representation before the Committee. However, in practice, authors are almost never given an opportunity to present their case before the Committee.\nIn Shreya Singhal, the Supreme Court directed the Committee to pass written orders stating reasons, so that any aggrieved person may challenge the order by filing a writ petition. However, Rule 16 states that “Strict confidentiality shall be maintained regarding all the requests and complaints received and actions taken thereof.” Due to this confidentiality clause, any knowledge of the blocking order is limited to intermediaries who prioritize their business interests over civil liberties of citizens. Since the blocking orders and the minutes of the meetings of the Committee are confidential, RTI applications are either denied or provide woefully incomplete information. Therefore, filing writ petitions to challenge unjustified blocking of a website is practically impossible.\nWebsite blocking is also a violation of net neutrality, especially after the Department of Telecom (DoT) amended the license terms of ISPs to specifically include blocking as a discriminatory practice. According to the license terms, any blocking by ISPs must be proportionate, transient and transparent, and the existing state of affairs do not satisfy any of these requirements. You can read more about how website blocking violates net neutrality here.\nHow do we make blocking of websites a more accountable process?\nWebsite blocking violates constitutional rights of the public at large because the right to freedom of speech and expression includes the viewer’s right to access information. At IFF, we have taken several steps to reform this process.\n First, we have filed an RTI with the DoT enquiring about reasons for blocking www.dowrycalculator.com and a copy of the order directing the same. However, because of Rule 16, we are not too optimistic about our RTI query being answered. Second, we have relaunched Save the Internet because preserving net neutrality requires constant vigilance. We have compiled a large crowd sourced database of website blocking and we will be using this data for future advocacy. Through a formal representation, we have already requested the DoT to investigate these crowd sourced reports of unjustified blocking. You can read more about our representation regarding website blocking and lack of an enforcement structure for net neutrality here. Finally, we have made a representation to MEITY and sought deletion of the confidentiality requirement under Rule 16 because it is inconsistent with Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the Right to Information Act 2005, the judgement of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal, and the amended terms of the Unified License granted to ISPs.  We will continue engaging with MEITY and other branches of government till we achieve our goal of ensuring transparency in the website blocking process.\nImportant Links:\n Copy of representation sent to MEITY [link] Copy of RTI filed seeking order blocking Dowry Calculator [link]  If like us, you\u0026rsquo;re also tired of your favourite websites being blocked for no rhyme or reason, please consider supporting our work.

Far-fetched exemptions sought by MHA: IFF’s RTI applications which only sought consolidated total figures were rejected by the MHA on flimsy grounds. Moreover, the MHA’s refusal is hypocritical because in the past, it has voluntarily disclosed details of specific cases cracked using surveillance.  Background In December 2018, IFF had filed six RTI applications seeking statistics about electronic surveillance under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Section 69 is also at the heart of our PIL demanding judicial oversight in the surveillance process. The information obtained through these RTI applications would support our litigation work, and you can read more about our PIL for surveillance reform here.\nHaving a meaningful discussion about surveillance is impossible in India due to lack of facts and figures. So how do we fix this problem? Through these RTI applications, we hoped to fill this gap and bring statistical data which could form the basis of an informed debate into the public domain. To give you a sense of our RTI queries, the following is an illustrative list of figures sought by us:\n Total number of surveillance orders passed by the Competent Authority. Total number of surveillance requests from law enforcement agencies rejected by the Competent Authority. Total number of surveillance orders passed by the Competent Authority for prevention of any offence affecting the sovereignty or integrity, defense, or security of the State. Total number of surveillance orders passed by the Competent Authority for investigation of any offence. Total number of orders which authorize surveillance for more than 15 days.Total number of surveillance orders which were renewed for a period exceeding 60 days.  As you can see, we did not ask for details of a specific interception order or a particular individual. However, despite our request being limited to anonymous and consolidated figures, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) refused to provide the information citing various exemptions under Section 8(1) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. In his response, the Public Information Officer merely stated that disclosure of surveillance related statistics would threaten national security under Section 8(1)(a), endanger the safety of third parties under Section 8(1)(g) and interfere with ongoing investigations under Section 8(1)(h). The First Appellate Authority also cursorily rejected our first appeal without explaining how harm would be caused by disclosure of total figures.\nThe untenability of MHA’s objections Unwilling to give up, we filed a second appeal before the Central Information Commission. In our appeal, we have argued that our request should not be denied under Section 8(1) because we have not sought any identifying information about an individual or details of a particular interception order. The MHA’s refusal is especially ironic because as recently as February 2019, it has willingly provided details of even specific cases cracked using surveillance. In its counter-affidavit to our PIL seeking surveillance reform, the MHA has provided an illustrative list of forty three cases which were solved through surveillance. This illustrative list is intended to bolster the MHA’s defence of its surveillance powers, and therefore, there is selective disclosure of surveillance related data when it suits the government’s interests.\nWe need hard data for informed public debate In the absence of total figures, it is impossible to know what proportion of surveillance leads to actionable intelligence, and if the Government is casting an excessively wide net. Without this data, we do not know if the Competent Authority and Review Committee are merely acting as a rubber stamp and approving surveillance requests by law enforcement agencies without proper scrutiny. As the old saying goes, everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. Reliable and accurate data on surveillance could serve as a common basis for discussion between people holding opposing views, and this is why we are determined to go the distance in this fight for transparency.\nWhen such data has been made available in other countries, it has opened up the surveillance process to public scrutiny. For instance, in the United States, there was considerable uproar after it was revealed that Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts approved 99.97% surveillance requests received from the government. While the implications of such a high approval rate are debatable, the mere existence of such data enables the public to have an informed discussion on the subject. The lack of data is far more alarming in the Indian context because unlike the United States, we do not have any judicial oversight in the surveillance process and all decisions are taken by bureaucrats belonging to the executive branch.\nSo what comes next? We have been pursuing this through multiple levels of appeals and we will continue to persevere. Our efforts in court have already yielded results and the MHA’s reply to our PIL has brought to light for the very first time the Secret Operating Procedure used for conducting surveillance. You can read more about the Secret Operating Procedure here.\nIn this endeavour, we have been supported by an amazingly committed team of lawyers including Sai Vinod, Vrinda Bhandari, Karan Lahiri, Gautam Bhatia and Prateek Chadha.

However, late last week, an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court against this decision. An appeal to an appeal: To ensure the freedom of speech and expression through online viewing platforms, we hope the Supreme Court of India upholds the decision taken by the Delhi High Court in its stance on regulation of online streaming content.  Background The Justice for Rights Foundation approached the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court of Delhi (W.P. (C) 1164/2018) requesting for guidelines on regulating certain kinds of content on the online platform, that included abusive language, obscenity amongst many others. To our delight, the judgement provided by the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court established the capacity of the Information Technology Act, 2000 to regulating online content through its provisions with no need for external regulations. To this, the Justice for Rights Foundation filed a Special Leave Petition in the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court of India. The court issued notice on May 5, 2019 (Read the order here).\nIn our previous post, we looked at the reasoning provided by the Delhi High Court in maintaining that the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 were sufficient to deal with any concerns. We continue to appreciate the submissions by both the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology that enabled the Court to establish, that no need for further guidelines were necessary.\nAn appeal for an appeal To further this victory, the judgement in the Justice for Rights case was relied upon in yet another case Nikhil Bhalla v. Union of India \u0026amp; Ors (W.P.(C) 7123/2018) where it was dismissed by the Delhi High Court, as we updated you earlier.\nHowever, this appeal to the Supreme Court by Justice for Rights has the potential to impact the progressive stance taken by not only the Delhi High Court but also the Ministries involved. The remaining cases around the country as a result, are at the behest of this appeal and could succumb to a transfer to the Supreme Court.\nWe hope that the Supreme Court will uphold the position taken by the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Delhi Court and the Ministries in ensuring the uncensored freedom of viewing content sphere.

This was done with no information provided to the public on the stakeholders involved its formulation or meetings conducted. Lack of any transparency: IFF filed an RTI with the Department of Commerce requesting details of meetings carried out, stakeholders involved and documents related to the process. However, the response received claimed exemptions to providing information under 8(1)(i) under the RTI Act. With this seemingly recurring stance taken without legal justification, the question of transparency, the very intention behind the Act is being raised.  It\u0026rsquo;s meant to be \u0026ldquo;seek and ye shall find\u0026rdquo;. The process of a public consultation is undermined if any recommendations that will have wide ranging impact are not proactively disclosed to the public. IFF filed an RTI requesting the following information be provided.\n Details of the dates and participants of any meetings and consultations on the Draft E-Commerce Policy. Copies of the minutes on any meetings and consultations on the Draft E-Commerce Policy. Details of work and copies of the agreement, contract or office circulars for engagement or authorisation of work of any individual, organisation or entity has been engaged/contracted at any stage to provide services/advice/drafting. Information on any decisions taken for conducting any public consultation on the Draft E-Commerce Policy.  Disappointingly, the response to the RTI had the CPIO claiming exemption under 8(1)(i) where cabinet papers including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers are exempted from disclosure (Read here for more). Under no circumstance do any of the queries fall within the category of the deliberations of these officers to be deemed cabinet papers. Pertinent information is being refused with no legal basis, creating a cause for concern. While IFF has filed a first appeal challenging the response, this intention to withhold information is largely prevalent. We still await the publication of submission to the draft Personal Data Protection Bill. Similarly, an RTI filed by IFF to MEITY requesting the composition of the Cyber Regulatory Advisory Committee saw a similar lack in the provision of information.\nNo clarity to the disparity. The inconsistency in the Government\u0026rsquo;s stance is seen through the publication of stakeholder comments with identifying details in the consultation process of both the Draft Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines (Amendment) Rules, 2018 and the composition of the National E-Commerce Think Tank to an RTI filed by MediaNama (Read here for more).\nThe consultation process to both the Draft E-Commerce Bill and the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill is identical to that of the Intermediary\u0026rsquo;s Amendment Rules, involving no confidential information given there is no sensitivity of information. Inspite of an inherent public interest in the disclosure of this information to aid in transparency and inform academics and scholars combined with the obligation on the Government to proactively disclose all relevant facts relating to important policies or decisions affecting general public, we still find ourselves in this situation.

Jumping on the bandwagon:**** Following suit, in line with Justice For Rights, another case was dismissed before the Delhi High Court filed by Nikhil Bhalla. However, there still exist similar cases in the Delhi, Bombay and Karnataka High Court that need to look to the rationale in Justice for Rights.  Background The public interest litigation filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Delhi High Court asking for separate guidelines to regulate content on online streaming platforms was dismissed on February 8, 2019. The Court agrees with the stand taken by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) that the Information Technology Act is a robust enough legislation requiring no additional guidelines or regulation.\nOne down A similar case was filed in the Delhi High Court by advocate Nikhil Bhalla with reference to a dialogue demeaning the former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi.

Need for judicial oversight: In the rejoinder, we have pointed out that the Government has failed to substantively engage with our contention that the standard for evaluating fundamental rights claims has changed after the landmark 9 judge bench decision in KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India. Under the newly adopted proportionality standard, electronic surveillance will pass constitutional muster only if there is judicial oversight, and the existing regime which concentrates all power in the hands of the executive requires urgent reform.  Background Remember IFF’s petition before the Supreme Court seeking surveillance reform? Well, there have been some interesting developments in the case recently.\nYesterday, IFF filed its rejoinder in the constitutional challenge against Section 69 of the IT Act and the IT (Procedure for Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009. At yesterday’s hearing, the Supreme Court took our rejoinder on record and directed the matter to be listed after two weeks. On 20 December 2018, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued a notification authorizing ten law enforcement agencies to conduct electronic surveillance, and this prompted us to file a writ petition since it suggested an activation and expansion of the government’s surveillance machinery. You can read our detailed analysis of the history of surveillance in India here.\nThe Government’s stance Various petitioners including IFF have questioned the constitutionality of the existing surveillance framework, and the Government filed a common counter-affidavit responding to all the petitions. As a result, the Government’s response consisted of broad assertions which failed to engage with the specific and nuanced arguments made in our petition.\nFirst, the Government heavily relied on a never disclosed before Standard Operating Procedure to show that powers under Section 69 of the IT Act are exercised in a well regulated manner. Second, it repeatedly emphasized on the existence of a Review Committee in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 1997 in PUCL v. Union of India as a sufficient safeguard. Finally, it stated that judicial oversight in the surveillance process was undesirable because in order to effectively tackle threats like terrorism and organized crime, the executive needs speedy decision making. It also produced before the Court an illustrative list of cases cracked using electronic surveillance.\nWhy the Government’s defence is inadequate and misconceived The Government’s defence is like a bucket with too many holes that doesn’t hold water. In our rejoinder, we have responded to every argument made by the Government but four important submissions from our rejoinder are worth highlighting.\n(1) The Standard Operating Procedure is secret and illegal We have argued that the Standard Operating Procedure has no bearing upon the constitutionality of Section 69 of the IT Act or 2009 IT Rules. It is a form of executive action which lacks any legislative backing because it has not been issued under the IT Act or the Telegraph Act. Therefore, all electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to the Standard Operating Procedure before specific law enforcement agencies were notified on 20.12.2018 is illegal.\n(2) The Review Committee lacks judicial members and it is overburdened The existence of a Review Committee is insufficient because it only consists of officials belonging to the executive branch. Since it does not have any independent judicial members, the Review Committee is unlikely to rigorously examine whether an interception order genuinely pursues a legitimate aim and whether less restrictive alternatives are available. Moreover, according to the Srikrishna Committee Report, the three member Review Committee has to evaluate 15,000-18,000 interception orders at every meeting. The sheer volume of interception orders makes it practically impossible for the Review Committee to apply its mind to each interception order or conduct any enquiry or investigation to determine if an interception order is lawful. Therefore, the Review Committee is effectively a rubber stamp for law enforcement agencies.\n(3) R_eliance on PUCL v. Union of India is outdated and incorrect_ The Review Committee is in conformity with the guidelines laid down in _PUCL v. Union of India_ but that judgement was delivered twenty two years ago in the context of telephone tapping, and the technological landscape has undergone massive change since then. In the modern digital age, individuals share and store a large amount of sensitive personal data on their computers and smartphones. Further, law enforcement agencies are now equipped with advanced tools that have centralized and automated the surveillance process and even enabled them to track and analyse social media activity of citizens. Therefore, due to increase in both the government’s capability and the citizens’ vulnerability, the threat to privacy posed by electronic surveillance is substantially higher today than it was two decades ago. After the 9 judge bench decision of the Supreme Court in _KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India_ recognizing a fundamental right to privacy, the judicial standard for adjudicating rights claims is the proportionality test, and in the absence of judicial oversight, surveillance cannot be considered proportionate.\n(4) Lack of transparency and withholding of surveillance related data While submitting a list of illustrative cases cracked using surveillance, the Government has conveniently not revealed how many total interception orders were passed during the relevant period in spite of multiple RTI requests. Therefore, it is impossible for us to determine what proportion of electronic surveillance results in actionable intelligence and whether law enforcement agencies are casting an excessively wide net.\nThe tentative next date of hearing is 10 May 2019 and we will keep you posted about the progress of the case.

The Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court of India refused to stay the ban against the download of \u0026ldquo;TikTok\u0026rdquo; from application stores. Need for alternative measures to banning: It is necessary to move away from outright bans on applications that provide no resolve and infringe upon the right to freedom of speech and expression and (online) assembly to active policy and regulatory measures for the protection children and young adults online. __ This can only be done after potential harms are studied scientifically and a rights respecting framework can be developed. Today, we wrote to the Government to urgently start this process with an approach paper and a public consultation.  Background The recent outright bans such as on popular video game called PUBG in various districts of Gujarat resulted in the arrest of at least 21 young persons and the current ban on a video sharing platform called Tik Tok has resulted in preventing its download from Application Stores appears to be setting a precedent. On April 3, 2019, a PIL in the High Court of Madras led to the ban of Tiktok for its negative impact. Once the Supreme Court of India refused to the stay the order on the ban, MEITY gave further orders to remove the application from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. As mentioned in our previous post, IFF has taken the next step forward.\nNeed for Action Today, we wrote a representation to the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) in response to this ban [Read it here]. It explains that the ban is a disproportionate reaction to the need to afford protection to children on the internet. Not only does it go against the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), it also violates the principle laid down by the Shreya Singhal case that protects intermediaries from liability and requires individualised content takedowns pursuant to court and executive orders. Bans by-pass this important protection which came through as a hard fought victory for internet users in India [read more on the Shreya Singhal case here].\nWe are not closing our eyes to the arguments being made about potential threats to minors on digital platforms. Proceeding towards a state of moral and social panic which leads to bans are the easy way out. It is necessary to take a more informed and calibrated approach with the government proactively laying down best practice norms, monitoring compliance and punishing violators.\nHence, to commence a policy based dialogue, our letter urges MEITY to undertake the three specific actions which may lead to better outcomes.\n Adopt a rights respecting stand against “App Bans”: Ensure bans are not imposed in maintaing fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, judgements of the Supreme Court emerging from Shreya Singhal and Puttaswamy v. Union of India [2017 10 SCC 1]. Commence a transparent consultation process: Engage in a transparent approach or consultation paper inviting public comments on social media, technology and adolescent health as a joint effort with the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Activate the CRAC: Bring back to life the defunct CRAC (Cyber Regulations Advisory Committee) which has been statutorily tasked under the Information Technology Act, 2000 to provide the function of guidance ensuring that technology is harnessed in a rights respecting framework and meets the challenges of any potential harms.  The letter has been addressed to MEITY with copies marked to the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.\nIFF will continue to engage in every possible manner in order to ensure that not only are bans not the defacto response but that the necessary steps forward to the protection of children and young adults on digital platforms is given the necessary push within the framework of digital rights — for their freedom, health and safety.\nLinks to important documents  Letter on the safety of minors on digital platform [link] Statement on TikTok by IFF [link]  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/an-alternative-to-bans-a-letter-to-meity/","summary":"In a letter written to MEITY, IFF reasons the need for alternative measures to addressing the safety of minors instead of resorting to disproportionate bans.","title":"An alternative to bans.

This game, ‘PUBG’ had been banned by at least six police departments in Gujarat through proclamations made under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\nA copy of our writ petition is available here.\nPrior to filing this petition, on 14 March, we had issued a public appeal for revoking these Section 144 orders and ceasing criminal prosecutions against people for playing PUBG. However, despite positive statements from police departments, particularly the Ahmedabad Police, that the ban would not be renewed, some Section 144 orders such as the one passed by the Rajkot Police continue to be in force till April 30. Further, the legal prosecutions would have continued against these young persons who would have either suffered a long criminal trial for years, or may have pleaded guilty for a fine which would then impact their professional prospects and ability to travel abroad for further studies.\nThe collateral consequences of a criminal conviction can affect a person’s ability to get admission into a college, find a job, rent a house, obtain a visa and so on. This is a serious matter and a criminal conviction for playing PUBG would impose significant disabilities on the 21 young people who have been arrested. We sensed that this required urgent intervention as was extensively pleaded in the writ petition. However, the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court when the case came up for hearing today, i.e. on 11.04.2019 refused to hear the petition at the threshold. This means it has refused to hear the case and dismissed it at the preliminary stage. In such a situation, a short order is usually issued by the court setting out its reasons which we will make available publicly as and when it is uploaded. We were represented by an excellent legal team comprising of Asim Pandaya and Manan Bhatt and we are deeply thankful to them.\nDuring today’s hearing, the Hon’ble Gujarat High Court mentioned that individuals who have been arrested for playing PUBG in contravention of Section 144 orders may approach the High Court on their own. However, this observation is subject to confirmation in the written order. We had anticipated such a concern and addressed it in Para 2.13 of our petition where we noted that young college students who have been arrested may not have the resources and support to withstand protracted litigation against the Police Department. However, the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court did not agree with our submission.\nIn terms of next steps, we will confer with our legal team and keep you informed.

We have filed a PIL before the Gujarat High Court challenging the PUBG Ban and the subsequent arrests as violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. We are being represented by an incredible litigation team consisting of Mr. Asim Pandya and Mr. Manan Bhatt. We expect that the matter will be listed for hearing in a week or two and we will keep you updated.\nWhy have you filed this challenge? Yes, while we are thankful for the public statement by the Ahmedabad police that the ban will not be renewed, there is nothing stopping it legally from happening. What is worse are the legal prosecutions that have resulted from it. While the PUBG ban may seem absurd and amusing at first glance, it is no laughing matter. Out of the twenty one people arrested, at least thirteen were young college students For a young student who is worried about his family’s reaction and future career prospects, being arrested by the police can be a deeply traumatic experience. To us the PUBG Ban is fuelled by moral panic and the harms from video games require scientific study and then non-legal methods of engagement.\nWe, at IFF, promise to keep fighting against such arbitrary and disproportionate bans, and we hope you will support us by becoming a member.\nJoin IFF and its stance for digital freedoms.

We agree that the privacy of children merits urgent legislative protection and this interim order may be an overreach on the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.  It often seems we are in the throes of a social (media-moral) panic. Within the space of a month we have seen the ban of PUBG in Gujarat by police departments and now the Hon’ble Madras High Court has banned, “TikTok” (refer to report by LiveLaw).\nBut first, what is, “TikTok”? It is a social networking application that is aimed towards video creation and sharing. The average length of videos ranges from 10-60 seconds. While such a format has been socially critiqued for a range of impacts, the Hon’ble High Court of Madras has passed three harsh directions which merit to be contested.\nThe first direction prohibits the download of the application, the second prohibits the television telecast of videos created through it and the third directs a response from the Union Government on it’s position to legislate a statute analogous to the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Much of this has been done without adequate legal reasoning. While there are several legal arguments to be made against these directions, we are examining whether IFF should approach the Hon’ble Court and offer assistance.\nBriefly, we share the concern of the Hon’ble Court on issues of privacy, cyber bullying and addiction. Children deserve legal protection online. This is why we have in the Draft Indian Privacy Code, 2018 made exhaustive provisions with respect to it.

To which we built a crowd-sourced information form encouraging users to report violations of net neutrality they were facing. Need for an enforcement mechanism: The main threat to net neutrality is the absence of mechanism that monitors, reports and provide users with a well established redressal process to address violations.  Background Owing to a large public movement on Net Neutrality known as SaveTheInternet.in, the Telecom Regulations Authority of India (TRAI) made the, “Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016” which banned zero rated services after much public protest. Further consultations on the issue of technical discrimination led to the TRAI eventually introducing amendments to the Unified License conditions which upheld the intrinsic connection between net neutrality and free speech.\nNeed for Action In our previous posts, we provided information of our analysis of the reports of blockings that we received (Read here for more). We also explain why website blocking is a violation of net neutrality here. In brief, when any blocking is carried out without direction or order of the Court/Government, it is considered to be discriminatory treatment. Additionally, even if this measure is being engaged, it is necessary that it be done in a manner that is “proportionate, transient and transparent”. Neither of these conditions have been met and have left users with no understanding of the reasons for such blockings or a mechanism for redressal. Hence, in light of the growing intensity of such violations and after seeking advice from external legal counsel, we have made a formal representation to the Department of Telecommunications requesting for certain interim steps to be carried out (Read here for more).\n That as an interim solution, investigation into the reports of violation submitted by close to 250 people, until an enforcement body in line with the recommendations of the TRAI, is set up. That the DOT enforce its authority to ask for records/information of compliance by licensors especially with regard to the complaints reported to us. That in ensuring deterrance of such violations, necessary fines for breach be considered.  However, these are just the initial steps in supporting TRAI\u0026rsquo;s recommendations in creating an enforcement structure for Net Neutrality. We are only just beginning!\nLinks to important documents  Representation to the Department Of Telecommunications (link)  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/representation-to-the-dot-on-net-neutrality-violations/","summary":"In light of the growing intensity of net neutrality violations, we make a formal representation to the Department of Telecommunications highlighting the need for an enforcement mechanism.","title":"Representation to the DOT on net neutrality violations."},{"content":"Over the last few months, IFF has been on the look out for Net Neutrality violations. Through an online reporting form, we gathered evidence of extensive blocking carried out by not just one but various ISP’s all over the country. We created a data sheet and provided a summary of the reports based on the information collected. A round total of 200 responses of blockings beginning January, 2019 to March 2019 was received.\nIn light of these rampant violations, we thought it fit to re-activate our #SaveTheInternet website and a week has passed since. The website has \u0026ldquo;Take Action Petition\u0026rdquo; button, which allows individuals and organisations to show support to list of joint demands which is then sent to the relevant government offices. The purpose behind this decision was move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning. In this short period of a mere week, we have received tremendous support with about 970 signings.\nThe website also has the option to submit reports of any net neutrality violations to us. In addition to our earlier 200, we have received a further of 65 reports of such continued blocking. This is a brief analysis of the latest reports.\nBroad Trends  We continue to see general blocking of porn, proxy, VPN, torrent and streaming websites; Streamable, College humour, Sound cloud, Telegram, Reddit and Alexa.com, as we did in our previous reports.  There have been a few responses that indicate blocking of sites that measure internet speeds, gaming sites and some report pure latency being introduced for certain websites. A large portion of these connections are mobile based but there have been a number of wired connections reports as well. The ISP conducting the highest amount of blockings is Jio, both mobile and wired with some from Airtel, Hathway, You Broadband, Spectra amongst a few others. The blockings have been widespread, ranging from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal to Maharashtra, Karnataka to name a few states. The most recent report that has drawn a considerable reaction from users is the blocking of indiankanoon and earlier today, taxscan. Claims are that a Government order has been provided for indiakanoon, however, there has been no evidence or reason for the blocking. Additionally, after this blocking was discovered, access has been restored to the website.  A consolidated datasheet of the form which redacts the personal details of the respondents is available here. In our efforts to address these violations, we plan on sending a detailed response to the Department of Telecommunications and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India of our findings.

Updates from #SaveTheInternet on Website Blocking"},{"content":"The Momentous Result On March 24, 2019, we celebrated the four year anniversary of the one of the most significant judgements in the digital rights sphere, the case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India. Many of you may have kept abreast with this tumultuous journey over the years, so here is a brief recap timeline of our adventures.\n2012: When 21 year old student Shaheen Dhada was charged under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 for her comment on the shutdown of public functions due to the death of late Bal Thackeray, the fight for internet freedom in India took flight. Section 66A criminalized the dissemination of certain types of messages that were offensive or menacing. This provision was used so indiscriminately for the prosecuting of individuals for their basic expression of free speech. As a result, a petition to amend this Section was filed in the Supreme Court against this disproportionate law.\n2013: After the Supreme Court issued notice in this petition, there were several others that filed petitions challenging Section 66A. We mention the a few groups such Common Cause, the online review website Mouthshut, The Internet and Mobile Association of India and the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, to draw importance to need for collaboration amongst various stakeholders from diverse backgrounds. Individuals, civil rights groups and industry associations who all came together to further and deepen constitutionality.\n2015: The challenge to this section took two years to receive the landmark judgement by the Supreme Court declaring 66A unconstitutional, however, this was merely the beginning of things to come.\nThe Illegitimate Four-Year Reign 2016: Even after it was struck down, reports by the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) Crime in India released during the year, informed that around 4,154 new cases were filed and 3,137 arrests were made in 2015, while 2,423 arrests were made the previous year. In addition, about 575 people were still in jail on January 1, 2016, twice as many as the 275 in prison when the law was in force a year earlier.\n2017: There were whispers of a proposition by the Ministry of Home Affairs to strengthen Sections 153A and 505 (laws that deal with hate speech and statements of public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code through amendments, rather than modifying 66A. An idea that received support by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.\n2018: A working paper by the Internet Freedom Foundation through Abinav Sekhri and Apar Gupta published a study of the continued prosecution under 66A despite it’s declaration as unconstitutional. It looked to media reports, online legal databases and reports of the National Crime Records Bureau to analyse cases. Through their study, they established that 66A lived on. However, we did see an update to electronic records of the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code on Indiacode that incorporated the changes the judgement brought about, making 2018 a little less grey.\n2019: Blue skies appeared when in collaboration with PUCL, we took this research to court to ensure these prosecutions were stopped once and for all. Victoriously, the Hon’ble Court once again took a positive stance by ordering that a copy of the Shreya Singhal judgement to all Courts, Prosecutors and Police Departments in India to ensure complete awareness through the grapevine.\nThe Current State of Affairs But the Shreya Singhal decision was much more than about Section 66A. It concerned the intermediary rules which govern platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. It also dealt with website blocking. Both these issues stressed on the importance of protecting our fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.\nOver the past few months, the digital sphere has grappled with intense hurdles to its somewhat generally free and uninhibited state of being. We have brought to the forefront two further issues apart from the horrendous revival of Section 66A.\n  Website Takedowns: Late 2018 saw the introduction of the Draft Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules which largely threatened to clamp down on the right to freedom of speech and expression through breaking encryption, automated censorship, further Government access to personal data (Read here for more). However, before this was released to public consultation, the Indian express reported that these changes were first debated in a private meeting. Subsequently, we thought it necessary to make these changes public. This was promptly followed by a call for comments.\n  Website Blockings: We portrayed in our very visual explanation, the violations of Net Neutrality through the rampant spike in blocking that are being carried out by various ISP’s all over India over the last few months. Initially, we collated the data received through our online reporting form but most recently, we informed you of our re-activation of SaveTheInternet campaign in light these various threats to net neutrality.\n   We thought that in light of the four-year Shreya Singhal anniversary, it was necessary to highlight that these victories not only take time but continued efforts. These results require constant advocacy action and follow-up. More importantly, the joint-collaborations with various like-minded organisations activists that truly care for your digital rights is what enable these triumphs. Without any of this, we face the risk of scale-back and recession as is happening right now.\nTherefore, as far as clichés go, we assure you that we along with many others will continue to rage and rage against the dying of the light.\nContinue to support us and we continue to support you!

In our previous post, we applauded the Court for letting us Netflix and Chill but noted that the judgement contained an erroneous reference to the infamous legal zombie- Section 66A of the IT Act.\n**But wait, how did the legal zombie rise from the dead again?**It seems that while recording the submissions made by MeitY, an inadvertent reference to Section 66A crept into the Court’s judgement. Before the Court, MeitY adopted a progressive stance and submitted that existing provisions under the IT Act were sufficient to deal with illegal content on online platforms. However, it looks like Section 66A was inadvertently mentioned as one of the tools available with law enforcement agencies for punishing people who post offensive content. Unfortunately, the Court recorded this submission in the judgement without noting that Section 66A had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2015.\nLeave no tombstone unturnedWe first sent a letter to MeitY on 20 February 2019 to get the inadvertent reference to Section 66A removed. Since we did not know if there was anything being done on the Government’s end, we decided to file an application for modification ourselves on 12 March 2019 to avoid any further delay. The application was listed for hearing today and we were represented by our fantastic counsel, Sanjana Srikumar. At the hearing, we learnt that the Government had filed a similar application on 11 March 2019 which had been disposed off the next day.

Materials: In our previous posts, you will find that we have been gathering evidence from our online reporting tool of website blocking. Based on this, we have made brief summaries of the scope of these blockings. To understand the gravity of this situation, we also explain why and how net neutrality is violated through these blockings.  You may have observed how Net neutrality has been on the fritz in India over the last few months. We have witnessed blatant violations through website blockings across a variety of ISP\u0026rsquo;s. So what good is our victorious net neutrality win if it’s not being enforced? For this reason, we informed you of our decision to re-activate #SaveTheInternet. Today, savetheinternet.in is live to demand action.\nOver the past 2 months, we have received reports of website blockings across ISPs demonstrating network interference. What was shocking was there is no enforcement of India’s hard fought victory on Net Neutrality. We explained why this is a violation and the desperate need for an enforcement mechanism (Read here for more). It is for this reason, we ask you to sign the, “Take Action Petition” on savetheinternet.in. It makes it possible for individuals and organisations to show support to a list of joint demands, which are then sent to the relevant government offices. This allows us to move beyond email support for net neutrality to active petitioning. In addition to this, we also ask you to send us reports on website blockings and other forms of network interference (latency, slowing down particular forms of traffic). We will examine these reports and consider filing formal complaints and ensure TRAI and DOT devise the necessitated enforcement mechanisms. We will make all possible efforts to maintain our title as the country with the strongest net neutrality laws.\nOver the past 4 years many people, organisations \u0026amp; groups helped the net neutrality victory in India under the banner of #SaveTheInternet.

This effectively prohibited pricing and technical discrimination as offered Facebook’s Free Basics services. In 2018, TRAI further solidified net neutrality in its recommendations which the Department of Telecommunications adopted to make license amendments. However, there have been lasting concerns over the years that largely deal with lack of enforcement of these Rules. This brings us to the current day scenario where we have been witnessing rigorous website blocking by TSP/ISP’s with no legal justification. We have been updating you in our previous posts of these rampant occurrences.\n\u0026ldquo;The Present and Future of Net Neutrality in India\u0026rdquo; The Centre for Communication Governance at NLU Delhi and the Internet Freedom Foundation organised an engaging discussion on “The Present and Future of Net Neutrality” this on March 14, 2019 (Thursday) at the India International Centre, Annexe.

As per media reports which surfaced yesterday the Rajkot Police Department has arrested 7 youths for playing the PUBG online video game. Clearly things have spiralled out of control.\nA contested public debate PUBG entered the mainstream lexicon in which the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Prime Minister on January 29, 2019 while interacting with the concerns of a parent referred to it jovially. He clearly indicated in his remarks that, \u0026ldquo;technology is a problem \u0026ndash; as well as a solution\u0026rdquo; and suggested patience and guidance as an approach for encouraging children to use their time productively. Alongside these remarks advisories were being issued by Child and Adolescent welfare bodies in some states including Delhi and Gujarat that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance.\nIt is important to take a step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject. The top three cited meta studies on Google Scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes. Some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye co-ordination (remember the old Atari\u0026rsquo;s?).\n  \u0026ldquo;Link the studies\u0026rdquo;\n  Yes, we may be completely wrong in our inferences, but believe that this may be a matter for parental caution, and social debate but certainly not penal law. We explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as a legal issue below.\nProhibitory Order on playing PUBG The Rajkot Police Commissioner has issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on March 6, 2019. A Section 144 order under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies a breach of peace. While large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful. It would be a stretch to call such activities as threatening public order.\nHence, we were surprised when a Kumar Manish posted this tweet:\nToday, we have been able to have a rough translation prepared in English thanks to the help offered by Manan Bhatt.\nFrom reading the prohibitory order, it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports, 7 youths ranging from the ages of 19 to 26 have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order. At this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly a grave attack on personal liberty. We believe as the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Prime Minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of a parent and teachers. Certainly not by creating fear of penal law, through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests. This is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the State.\nIn the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to a legal team based out of Gujarat. We hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge the Gujarat government to look into this matter urgently. We appeal to them \u0026ndash; jailing people should not be a game.\nImportant Links  United News of India, Police Nab 7 youths in Rajkot for playing PUBG online game (Mar. 13, 2019).

We feel as we build out as an organisation, this is an area which needs to be supported with greater engagement on digital rights with India’s vibrant startup ecosystem.\nIn many of our conversations with many young, politically aware startup founders we notice a need to consistently engage on issues of technology policy and digital rights. We believe there are many who believe their business has the capacity for social good and support constitutional goals. This is the type of innovation we want to spur with opening up to organisational donations.\nPermitting donations by organisations will be a tremendous boost to our capacity and will come with financial support that will help us accelerate the pace of our work. A sizeable amount of this will go towards growing the tribe of close to 500 individual donors and members who have built a grassroots giving culture in the first few months of IFF being a staffed organisation.\nTo clearly set out what is the larger vision for organisational donors we are floating our ideas on this publicly for input and comments which will help us sharpen our pitch and also consider risks to our larger mission. We encourage you to comment and send us your thoughts and suggestions.\nWhat IFF has to offer to Indian tech companies While more people in India come online and a vast array of services and products are devised sizeable value is played by building and preserving user trust. This takes thought, time and positive action to build and we are confident is the approach being taken by many entrepreneurs in India. There are three useful ways we think by contributing to IFF organisations can grow a culture of digital rights within and support wider efforts as well.\n  Knowledge sharing: We will keep a quarterly meetup in which IFF programme priorities are discussed which provide an opportunity to highlight concerns on digital rights. Such knowledge sharing helps build greater expertise and focus by IFF on emerging issues in the technology sector. To supplement this regular calls will also be organised to which IFF’s Organisational Donors can nominate their staff to attend.\n  Improve product, build user trust: This also builds a better channel of communication between IFF and organisations which have tech products (IFF does not endorse or certify any organisation or products) in which IFF staff can provide inputs in person on digital rights concerns which may arise and give an opportunity for organisations to self-correct.\n  Bragging rights and a tax write off: The organisation’s logo with the level of support will be clearly indicated on IFF’s website. As IFF is a 80G non-profit all donations to it are eligible for a tax write off.\n  How will IFF retain its mission and character over the long term? The hallmark for our organisational donors is the three guiding principles of independence, transparency and credibility. For us to be effective over the longer term of time we must excel on all three. Some hallmarks of our plan are indicated below:\n  Independence: Organisational donorship to IFF will be independent of any positions. It will not give any membership or voting rights. We will not endorse any companies, their products and will continue to be guided by our mission and core values.\n  Transparency: We will proactively and publicly disclose all IFF’s Organisational Donors and their level of financial support to us. This will be updated regularly.\n  Credibility: In our decisions we promise to maintain the credibility of IFF and avoid any short terms steps which may impact its long term effectiveness. For instance, we will not prefer IFF’s Organisational donors over their competing entities.\n  We call on you to send us any comments, thoughts and suggestions you may have over at join@internetfreedom.in.

We have previously explained why the existing legal framework for surveillance needs urgent reform. This is further explained by Nitin Sethi\u0026rsquo;s analysis in the Business Standard available here.\nThe Counter-Affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs has disclosed the Standard Operating Procedure followed by law enforcement agencies to snoop on citizens. The Standard Operating Procedure is more appropriately titled as the Secret Operating Procedure because it has been brought into the public domain for the first time. The disclosure of the Secret Operating Procedure is a major step in reforming India’s surveillance regime which is otherwise shrouded in secrecy.\nA copy of the Counter-Affidavit and the Secret Operating Procedure has been made available by The Leaflet.\nWhile we are reserving finer legal contentions for court the contents of the Counter-Affidavit and the Secret Operating Procedure confirm our worst fears. They confirm a centralization of power in the hands of an opaque and unaccountable Union Executive. There is little accountability and little or no penalties for a breach of this procedure. The hallmark of this entire process is secrecy.\nWhat is also significant is that despite repeated requests, the Government has not disclosed the total number of interception orders passed in its Counter-Affidavit. Further, the Government’s reply confirms that there is complete lack of judicial oversight in the surveillance process which will greatly help reform the current system.\nWhat happens next?

We emerged victorious when net neutrality in India acquired solid footing through recommendations issued by the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) prohibiting Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services. In brief, we explained how TRAI recognised the principle of non-discrimination broadly interpreted with good reason, providing understandable exceptions along with a mechanism for transparency and accountability. However, over the years in extensively covering this issue, we have become privy to various bumps in the supposed unhindered existence of net neutrality in India.\nCurrently, a particularly concerning threat to net neutrality, looms the web. IFF has been engaging with users for a few months gathering evidence through its online reporting form of extensive blocking carried out by not just one but various ISP’s. In a previous post, we disclosed a data sheet and provided a summary of the reports based on information collected.\nUpdated Summary  Over the month, the number of reports provided to us has seen a considerable increase now standing at a total of 171 responses of blocking, beginning January, 2019 to March 8, 2019. A large portion of our findings are mobile internet users at 62.9% while 29.3% are wired connections, graphically represented below as well. Reports show that blockings conducted by Hathway have begun more recently over the past month and a half restricting access to Proxy Services, Virtual Private Networks and majorly the Telegram website. Over the past few days, there have been increasing complaints against Jio for the blocking of Reddit in cities ranging from Bangalore, Chennai, to Pune and Noida.    Seeing is believing Understandably, one would assume a direct correlation between illegality/immorality and blocking. However, this is far from true. It has spared no corner of the web, from pornography, proxy and torrent sites, VPNs to even mainstream platforms like Archive.org, Telegram and Soundcloud. Most recently, we discovered reports as from various users as in the summary above, that even Reddit has been blocked specifically on Jio GigaFiber, if accessed without VPN. We provide a few instances below to exemplify our reports since naturally, seeing is believing. However, we go beyond it to active monitoring of ISPs by the DOT for compliance and eventually towards remedy.\n    Is it a violation, you ask? This blocking trend has raised significant concerns regarding its impact on net neutrality. The fundamental aspect in maintaining net neutrality is the equal treatment of all data with no restriction on the access choices of the user. The Department of Telecommunication in the amendments it carried out, aim to ensure this. Ideally, this created a prohibition on internet service providers from either speeding up, slowing down, restricting choice, bandwidth and the ability to access anything on the Internet.\nIt is important to understand the illegality behind these current swarm of blockings:\n  Violation of Net Neutrality - Firstly, an ISP is not permitted to engage in any discriminatory treatment of content. Discriminatory here indicates any form of discrimination, restriction or interference in the way it treats content - it goes on to include practices such as blocking, degrading, slowing down or granting preferential speeds or treatment. Therefore, in light of our current block-mania, it is in clear violation of net neutrality.\n  Type of Practice - Secondly, even if such practices are engaged, there is a mandate on ISP’s to be proportionate, transient and transparent and can be carried out only under specific conditions. We have examined a variety of reports concluding that there has been no explanation by the ISP’s for the blocking; the continuity over the last few months clearly it not temporary and neither has it been conducted transparently with no information being provided by the\n  ISP Requirements - Thirdly, the conditions it fails to comply with are of particular importance to us. These practices can be conducted if an ISP is reasonably managing traffic, providing emergency services during a grave public emergency, in order preserve integrity and security of the network/equipment, in pursuance of an international treaty and most applicable to us, in implementation of a court order or Government direction. Evidently, the latter is especially not the reason as per an RTI request (Read here for more).\n  Additionally, what is of further concern is the absence of mechanism that monitors, reports and provides users with a medium to lodge complaints against ISP’s, as a safeguard. In an earlier submission to TRAI and the DOT, we suggested there be an enforcement mechanism of sorts, in line with the recommendations made by TRAI. This will provide users with a well established redressal process to address net neutrality violations. We are in dire need of transparency and an enforcement mechanism as the number of merely recorded reports are becoming increasingly commonplace.\nOur fight for net neutrality has stood its ground in the face of continued opposition through out these years and we will not be slack in this attempt to undermine one of India’s most significant digital victories. Over the next few weeks we will be attempting to organise a convening of important stakeholders to this conversations, examining steps for actual enforcement, remedy and complaint. We would be failing in our duty to protect Net Neutrality if we do not pick this up soon.\nLink to important posts\n Our summarised report of Net Neutrality violations around India (link) Raw spreadsheet of reports violations (link) Tell us if your ISP is blocking any proxy websites or VPNs.

While the Constitution was drafted several decades before the invention of the internet, it is a progressive and visionary document. All technologies must respect the fundamental rights of citizens and further constitutional values of justice, equality, liberty and fraternity. Non-Partisanship: We represent all individuals and organizations to achieve systemic policy change regardless of ideological leanings or party politics. Collaboration: We recognize the value of adopting a collaborative approach because the harms arising from new technologies are often disproportionately borne by vulnerable and marginalized groups. Technological expertise: Our board of trustees and group of volunteers consist of several technologists and we also seek input from external experts with domain knowledge. This enables us to assist courts by shedding light on the technological feasibility of different alternatives which may be under consideration.

A similar PIL has been filed with the Karnataka High Court on February 2, 2019 requesting the Government to prescribe suitable legislation to regulate viewing content on online streaming services. Need for consistency: The Delhi High Court in its judgement reinforced the adequacy of the Information Technology Act. We wrote to the Ministry of Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to ensure steps are taken to similar stance in relevant cases.  Background Recently, the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court of Delhi was approached by the Justice for Rights Foundation praying for separate guidelines on online streaming content (Read here for more) where the Court took a positive stand in maintaining the sufficiency of the Information Technology Act, 2000. However, in yet another Public Interest Litigation, the Karnataka High Court has served notice in a petition approached before it, seeking regulation of online video streaming services (Find the order here). This petition has a slight twist to it.\nIf You Can\u0026rsquo;t Beat Them, Join Them While the attempt to create new guidelines took a bit of a nose-dive, what better way than to slyly use existing legislation to achieve the same goal. Unlike the case in the Delhi High Court, this petition additionally desires to include online streaming within the ambit of what is known as the Cinematograph Act, 1952. As a result, this would render it as \u0026lsquo;public exhibition\u0026rsquo;, requiring such content to be certified; regulated by suitable legislation with an appropriate Board through sanction. This would potentially function much like the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) likely to further extend its moral policing habits. It\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely that anyone wants a Pahlaj Nihalani regime on the internet.\nHowever, the basic premise behind this petition lies in the claim that there is a lack of legislative framework in the regulation of online viewing content. Keeping this in mind however, the Delhi High Court has rightly enforced the adequacy of the Information Technology Act, 2000 in governing content and the platform, establishing that there is no need for separate guidelines (Read the Order here).\nWe wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on February 20, 2019 suggesting steps in ensuring consistency in such cases in all courts (Read our letter here). Once again, we approach their offices requesting a press release on the order passed by the High Court of Delhi to ensure the positive stand receives greater awareness amongst both the Courts and the general public. We hope the Karnataka High Court will consider this to maintain such consistency in the not only the protecting of our right to freedom of speech and expression but also in the self sufficiency of Information Technology Act.\nDocument Links  Public Interest Litigation filed in the Karnataka High Court on February 2, 2019 Our letter to the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology dated March 7, 2019 Public Interest Litigation filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation and a copy of the Order dated February 8, 2019.

The United Kingdom called upon various individual such as David Carroll, an associate professor at the Parsons School of Design, Sandy Parakilas, Chief Strategy Officer at the Center for Humane Technology, a non-profit organisation. Further hearings even included renowned privacy activist and lawyer, Max Schrems. Through this we are trying to convey to the committee the need and benefit in inviting experts and academics to contribute with their expertise on the issue.\nNeed for Clarity Social media safety is a very wide terrain. It has several platforms with their own unique ecologies of communication, benefits and risks. Here is it useful to set criteria and define the scope of the hearings by the Parliamentary Committee.

In the next few months we will take part in the largest election exercise all around the world. This cycle should not only be viewed in terms of power, victors and losers, but public issues which become governance priorities. We are today announcing that we will be conducting pro-active outreach to ensure that digital rights find reflection in the campaign priorities of all candidates, across afflictions and ideology.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s growing smartphone generation What will make this election different from others? While we generally avoid political punditry some figures evidence how and why digital rights must feature as a priority in the campaign manifestos of political parties and all candidates.\nFirstly, there is an increased number of young voters that fall within the age bracket of 20-34 as per the latest figures of the Election Commission of India. Forty-five million young people have become eligible to vote in these upcoming elections. This has roughly increased our electorate by about 5%. The hopes and aspirations of these young group of Indians sometimes referred to as millennials or Generation Y rest upon the political promises of a better future.\nThis makes the second most important factor, technology. More Indians are today online than ever. As per the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India about 560.01 million Indian\u0026rsquo;s are online at the end of Sep-18 with quarterly growth rate of 9.32%. These massive numbers signal that the digital divide is incrementally being bridged for scores of our fellow citizens. The continuing adoption of internet also signals a continuing belief that it has the potential to make our lives better. This can only be ensured when the users have rights, remedies and safeguards.\nA core issue which is recurring in this aspect, has been the absence of a clearly articulated message and a charter of demands surrounding technology. One which can be placed before political parties to input into their campaign manifestos through which it can promote greater engagement on these issues and ensuring productive outcomes through institutions and governance processes.\nOur attempt at a digital rights manifesto We have some thoughts here as an organisation that has been working on digital rights issues. We think that it’s time to stop being reactive and begin engaging positively with all candidates and parties to ensure greater consensus on digital rights which can only come from an understanding of our constitutional values.\nAn initial set of demands which has been drafted after conversations with a few groups and experts from the digital rights sector are being made available by us publicly for review and inputs. At the same time due the short timelines for the finalisation of campaign manifestos we are reaching out to all political parties and candidates to open a channel of communication.\nLink to the Digital Rights Agenda (GoogleDoc)\nWe admit that we do not have all the answers and in the coming weeks will keep seeking opinions, collaborations and reaching out to fine tune our approach and the substance of these proposals. However, given the short timelines we think it is imperative to start this conversation. Together we must consider what can be done to ensure greater liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in and through technology.\nWe feel that these demands will greatly benefit India\u0026rsquo;s smartphone generation. This is a constituency which values its online privacy and free speech. Being digital natives they have grown up with technology. It has not suddenly entered their lives but continues to provide them utility and comfort. They recognise its power and its utility. They are politically active and recognise the benefits of issues such as net neutrality. To them digital rights matter enough to cast their votes.\nHow can you help?  Input into the digital rights charter: We call on the growing IFF community and all those who passionately feel about digital rights to input in or send us an email on this digital rights agenda. We want your thoughts and suggestions. What is a digital rights issue that would make you cast your vote in favour of a candidate? Tell us. We want to know from you.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) informed the Court that the Information Technology Act is a robust enough legislation. On February 8, 2019, the High Court agreed with this submission and dismissed this PIL. Industry proposes Self-Regulation: In January 2019 at the India Digital Summit in New Delhi, the Internet and Mobile Associations of India (IAMAI) along with some prominent online video streaming companies created a code for self-regulation. As per press reports this has been presented to MEITY and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) for endorsement. We have in the past cited concern on this measure. Giving credit where it is due: We wrote to MEITY appreciating the position it took in affirming the sufficiency of the Information Technology Act for online video content streaming even though some provisions within it require reform. We have also called on for additional steps including seeking a correction of the order (given it cites the non-existent Section 66A) and asking a copy of it to be furnished in similar public interest litigations.  Background Three interesting events have taken place bringing us to this particular intersection.\nOne: On October 11, 2018 a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court of Delhi (W.P. (C) 1164/2018) requesting the Court for guidelines on regulating certain kinds of content on the online platform. This included web based shows such as Sacred Games, Game of Thrones etc., for vulgarity, pornography, abusive language, as you can imagine, the list goes on. This is not limited to certain adult-based content but even the use of the phrase \u0026lsquo;Holy Cow\u0026rsquo; in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Read the PIL here).\nTwo: On January 16, 2019, the Economic Times reported an agreement among certain companies and the IAMAI on a code for the self-regulation by online content providers. We explained the deterrent effect this would have on your online viewing experience (Read here for more).\nThree: On February 8, 2019, a division bench of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Delhi High Court consisting of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Justice V. Kameswar Rao delivered a verdict on the PIL filed by Justice for Rights Foundation dismissing the petition. This was possible largely due to the positive submissions by MIB and MEITY.\nAppreciation with a side of caution The Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court affirmed that while there is no separate provision for regulating online content, the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 were not only merely applicable but an adequately armed with Section 69 to block illegal content. It also contains an entire chapter of offences which can take care of illegal content. While we are concerned with some of them, this is an incremental victory. It prevents a heavy, licensing style system from emerging in the video streaming space which would threaten our viewing choices online.\nA large part of this result is due to the submissions of both the MIB and MEITY which pointed that there is no need for further guidelines when sufficiently stringent provisions are already in existence. Agreeing with them, the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court instructed that if the petitioner continued to consider content provided on certain platforms prohibitory, it should take it up with the relevant statutory authority. That\u0026rsquo;s legal for \u0026lsquo;tough luck\u0026rsquo;. You can find the order of the Court here.\nThis is a positive outcome due to the submissions made by two government ministries. We have called on them to cement this with taking the following actions:\n Incorrect reference to Section 66A: The Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court order has referred to Section 66A of the Information Technology Act which was struck down as unconstitutional. Here government ministries should ideally approach the Court and request for a correction of this error. Utilise the Order: After such an application has been made and a corrected order is available it may be used in similar PILs which are pending in different courts over India. This will prevent any inconsistency and help maintain our online freedoms. **Avoid according sanction to the self-censorship code:**If the IAMAI Self-Regulation Code for online video streaming platforms was to receive validation, it would result in it being accepted as an industry-wide norm. Cut to, the pre-censorship of your favourite shows. This would defeat the very beauty that lies in the uninhibited nature of online viewing content. Your shows would just be one magnificent \u0026lsquo;bleep\u0026rsquo; like Udta Punjab and its 94 cuts. It is for this reason we urge both MIB and MEITY to maintain its position which it took in this case.  We will be sending a letter for these follow up actions and also seeking a meeting with their offices. You can find our letter to MIB and MEITY at this link.\nDocument Links  Public Interest Litigation filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation and a copy of the Order dated February 8, 2019.

Union of India declared 66A of the Information Technology Act to be unconstitutional because it violated our fundamental right to freedom of speech. However, a study conducted by IFF found fresh cases continued to be filed. This meant people were being prosecuted, even ending up in jail for a law which does not exist. PUCL goes to court (again): PUCL one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal Case approached the court highlighting this study. The Court issued notice and asked the Government to respond which finally acted in January, 2019 and issued an advisory to all State Governments and asked them for data. For instance Kerala reported 18 cases while most state governments did not respond. Supreme Court protects us again: Yesterday, February 15, 2019, a series of directions were issued by the Court to not only close existing Section 66A cases but also prevent fresh registrations. These included directions for the Shreya Singhal judgement to be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.  Background Previously, we explained to you the why Section 66A of the Information Technology Act or what we called the ‘legal zombie’ was despite being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India still being used in courts and police stations across India (Read here for more).\nSection 66A was a criminal offence that permitted the imprisonment of anyone that posted offensive comments on the Internet. It was a vague section that was arbitrarily interpreted. This is why it was struck down. But it seemed to enjoy a half-life with continuing prosecutions and fresh FIRs. Yes, just like a zombie.\nTo put a stop to this we collaborated with PUCL which took the research study to court. PUCL is India\u0026rsquo;s leading human rights organisation and had litigated important victories for the liberties of ordinary Indian\u0026rsquo;s like you and me. It was one of the original petitioner\u0026rsquo;s in the Shreya Singhal case which lead to Section 66A being declared unconstitutional. Continuing their leadership on this issue they filed application registered as MA 3220/2018 in W.P. (Crl.) No. 199/2013 filed by PUCL seeking the Hon’ble Supreme Court to provide directions to ensure prosecution under 66A does not persist (Read here for more).\nWhat happened in court? We are happy to let you know in yesterday\u0026rsquo;s hearing on February 15, 2019 prayers in this application were largely granted by the Supreme Court. The case was listed in Court Room 6 as Item 52 before the bench of Hon’ble Justices Mr. Rohinton Nariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul. PUCL was represented by its team of lawyers lead by Mr. Sanjay Parikh, supported by Advocates Ramesh Pukhrambam; Sanjana Srikumar; Apar Gupta and Abhinav Sekhri and the Union of India by the Attorney General, K.K. Venugopal and many other lawyers who assisted him.\nThis came after the Ld. Attorney General supported PUCL\u0026rsquo;s plea for the need for greater awareness and sensitisation of courts, prosecutors offices and police. Prior to the hearing in a counter-affidavit the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on Section 66A. This included a letter it wrote on 11.01.2019 and then a reminder on 14.01.2019 to various State Governments asking them to furnish data on Section 66A cases and also asking them to close them.\nSome responded. For instance Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after Section 66A was held to be unconstitutional and they would be closing all of them. We expect greater compliance as the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court due to further directions that were issued by it (we will link the order when it is uploaded on the SC website). This included sending a copy of the Shreya Singhal judgement to all Courts, Prosecutors and Police Departments in India. As we indicated in our study that while ideally Section 66A should be removed by an amendment act of parliament, this is a promising outcome and will be a major check on fresh Section 66A FIRs.\nWe are grateful for this outcome which has come through in a non-adversarial manner. Reach out to us if you become aware of any continued prosecution under Section 66A. At the same time we promise to remain vigilant, collaborate with other organisations to ensure public victories on fundamental rights. After all legal zombies such as Section 66A have this uncanny tendency to rise from the grave.\nIFF\u0026rsquo;s role in the proceedings IFF has not only supported research that provides a studied basis to reliefs sought in court but through its executive director appeared in the case and assisted PUCL in management and work execution. As indicated before IFF will continue to engage with courts for public outcomes on digital rights. We will collaborate, support and work with other organisations, groups and collectives. We continue to urge people to support PUCL by signing on and becoming its members and making donations to them.\nDocument links  Sekhri, Abhinav and Gupta, Apar, Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies (October 31, 2018).

Initial comments from various civil society organisations and industry groups were released to counter-comments till February 14, 2019. Recall the proposed changes: We submit our counter-comments to MEITY showing our support for the concerns of Civil society Organisations while contesting the submissions of some corporates and industry bodies that would hurt online privacy and freedom of speech. We will challenge if these changes are made: We have clearly stated in our counter-comments that we intend to support and explore all legal remedies if these unconstitutional changes come to pass. We will continue to champion the fundamental rights of ordinary Indians who use the internet.  Why should you be concerned?\nDo you want china style restrictions on the way you can use the Internet? Neither do we. The changes proposed to the Intermediary Rules in the guise of safety, do just that. Curb your right to freedom of speech and to privacy. Previously, we explained to you that these Rules affect you whether you are an individual (click here to read) or a start-up (click here to read).\nThese proposed changes were put to a process of consultation that ended yesterday night. In our counter-comments, we put together the tremendous support shown from Civil Society Organisations highlighting the unconstitutionality of these proposed changes (click here to read our counter comments). We stand with these Organisations in the fight for your freedoms as we submit our counter comments to MEITY.\nHowever, there are always two sides to a coin. A few Industry Groups and companies are in complete support of these Rules. For instance, Reliance Jio states that, “We strongly recommend that the intermediary should enable tracing out of originator of such information on its platform, which will help Government agencies identify the originator of such misleading information and hold them accountable in order to maintain cybersecurity.” Sounds a little like a neighbouring country!\nDefending our constitutional promises\nApar Gupta, Executive Director at the Indian Freedom Foundation in an interview with The New York Times warned, \u0026ldquo;This is very similar to what China does to its citizens, where it polices their every move and tracks their every post on social media\u0026rdquo;.\nThroughout this process, we have tried to ensure these Rules are recalled. The Rules allow for ‘tracking’ through the weakening of end-to-end encryption, it necessitates providing the Government with information at the drop of a hat and also the removal of content on the internet based on still developing automated tools. These changes mean the information you send over applications could be traced by the Government. An intermediary could be required to provide any information about you. Anything you post on the Internet that is considered ‘unlawful’ could be taken down. These are just a few examples.\nFundamental Rights are a constitutional promise to every Indian. But these rules are an affront to our civil liberties.\nVideo Explainers\nWant to learn more? We collaborated with Bisbo (a youtube creator) to create video explainers in multiple Indian languages (English, Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi more to follow\u0026hellip;). Do watch them and send them to your college and family Whatsapp groups! The Rules are unconstitutional and violate our fundamental right to privacy and to freedom of speech and expression. But, if these Rules were to be passed in their present form you can be assured Internet Freedom Foundation will explore all means to challenge them - this includes going to court.\nWe’ll continue to show our love for the free and open internet so you can show your love on the Internet!\nRead more\n IFF\u0026rsquo;s Counter Comments to MEITY (PDF) IFF\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Tech Startups on the IT Rules (PDF or Google Docs).

What was his crime? Bajaj had joined investigations and was helping police with an investigation in the online sales of a clip that contained a sexually explicit material that came to be known as the, “DPS MMS clip”. This lead to better protections for online businesses in law what were called a safe harbor protections under the Information Technology Act. Recall proposal for changes: We analysed and prepared a guide for you on how a series of proposed changes to the safe harbor protections may have an adverse effect on your abilities and functioning as a start-up. Most of these changes would be bad for your users and your businesses. They would erode your users privacy and free speech and also saddle you with costs and compliances. Take action now: You can prevent these proposals from advancing further. This can be done in very simple ways by sending an email and engaging with an ongoing public consultation process.  How do the changes affect you? The changes to the Intermediary Rules will have a drastic impact on each stakeholder of the internet, especially all you aspiring entrepreneurs. The Rules tighten the reins with increased regulatory compliances and start-ups and small enterprises will find it extremely cumbersome to carry out business and meet the requirements set by law. This will impact your trust and reliability expected by users as their privacy and free speech rights will be put to risk.\nRead our guide here (google doc and pdf).\nWhat are the changes? The Information Technology Act Section 79 protects intermediaries from liability for any content hosted or created by third parties as long as it has remained a mere facilitator of information and is not involved in the creation or modification of the same. However, this is about to change for the worse. Right now troubling amendments to the Intermediary Rules that are made under Section 79 have been mooted by the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY).\nWith a large portion of activities carried out on any online platform, certain aspects are bound to be beyond your control. Objectionable user comments or content should not put you in the ‘dog house’ with the authorities. The Information Technology Act up until now protected intermediaries, be it social networks or even e-commerce platforms. With the changes, intermediaries would be required to actively participate in the regulating of these issues. This is in addition to other onerous requirements the proposed law will ask of you.\nAs a start-up, dedicating limited resources to this kind of active monitoring will definitely take a toll on your performance. We have explained how these Rules will affect you in detail. We want to ensure these rules are recalled.\nRead our guide here (google doc and pdf).\nWhat can you do to help? A public consultation has been announced by MeitY inviting comments and suggestions on these changes to the IT Rules. This ends on February 14, which is the period for counter-comments in this period you can support submissions by IFF, digital rights organisations and researchers who are calling for a complete roll back of these proposed changes.\n Step 1: Create a covering email with the subject, \u0026ldquo;Consultation on Proposed Changes to IT Rules\u0026rdquo;, which reads for instance as:   \u0026ldquo;I support the attached spreadsheet which quotes from digital rights and research groups in their submissions against the unconstitutional provisions of The Information Technology Rules 2018 that will affect my business and the right to privacy and freedom of speech of my users.

In this disturbing changes to the the Intermediary Rules were suggested. They would hurt our online privacy and be a massive blow to free speech online. Roll back this consultation: We made it a point to explain to you the damaging effect it would have on your online freedom but we are not alone. Many other digital rights organisations have articulated a principled and powerful opposition to these proposed changes. You can help: Send an email right now. We tell you how at the end of this post.  Why are any changes to the Intermediary Rules important?\nIntermediary rules impact all of us. Think about the legal rules that govern your ISP (think : Airtel, Idea-Vodafone, Jio or others), or a large social media platforms (Wikipedia, Github, Facebook, Sharechat, Youtube, Instagram, Twitter etc.), even small start-up online services you use and enjoy (for me it is personally IndianKanoon). Any changes to these rules not only massively change your online experience but also threaten your online privacy and free speech. In this context, the proposed changes to them gain importance.\nWhat changes have been proposed ?\nIn changes proposed late last year (read more here for context) the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules, 2011. This was initially done privately and after an Indian Express report, and us publicly disclosing them in full, MEITY acknowledged them and opened a public consultation. But there are problems with these proposed changes much beyond the initial secrecy. And it\u0026rsquo;s just not us saying this. Many other groups are taking leadership on this issue.\nThere seems to be somewhat of an unanimous response of several civil society organisations and research groups for the government to reconsider these proposed changes. Even though many have articulated different reasoning, emphasised a range of problems – constitutional, policy oriented, economic and technical. They all seem to be in broad agreement that these rules are bad for users, internet companies and the internet. They would hurt your privacy and online free speech without making you safer in any meaningful way. Even we in our submissions to an ongoing public consultation have made a clear call to MEITY to reboot this entire exercise (read here for more).\nBut, don\u0026rsquo;t take only our work for it. We have tabulated a table (PDF or Google Docs) with the voice of digital rights and research organisations who in 16 separate submissions make a common point. The proposed changes to Intermediary Rules must be reconsidered, if not recalled.\nWhat can you do to help ?\nSimple, send an email to MEITY. This will not take more than a few minutes.\n Step 1: Create a covering email with the subject, \u0026ldquo;Proposed Changes to IT Rules\u0026rdquo;, which reads for instance as:   “I support the attached spreadsheet which quotes digital rights and research groups in their submissions against the unconstitutional provisions of The Information Technology Rules 2018 that will affect my Right to Privacy and Freedom of Speech online. I call on you to recall the proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules, 2011”\n  Step 2: Attach the sheet of comments (PDF or Google Docs) by digital rights and research organisations. Step 3: This email should be sent to gccyberlaw@meity.gov.in; pkumar@meity.gov.in; sathya.s@meity.gov.in.  In the initial public comments only close to a 100 comments were sent to MIETY. Surely, we can do better. The last date for submission is February 14, 2019.

This effectively prohibited zero rated services such as, Facebook\u0026rsquo;s Free Basics and safeguarded the open and free internet. This was a massive public victory. Positive follow-up actions: Net Neutrality is a bundle of measures which safeguard user choice in their choice of online content. This should not be interfered by internet service providers. Acting on TRAI\u0026rsquo;s recommendations the DOT made license amendments on September 26, 2018 which also safeguarded ordinary internet users from technical forms of discrimination such as blocking and slowing down web services. Need for action: Some may ask what good are legal protections if they cannot be enforced? This is our fear as well. Over the past few months we have been engaging specifically for enforcement of net neutrality protections in India and are committed to exploring a range of actions to make sure they do not exist just on paper.  Analysis \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rdquo;, was the message that was broadcast far and wide on social media on February 8, 2016. Coming after a charged online campaign under the collective of SavetheInternet.in it signalled that public victories are possible. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on that day made the, \u0026ldquo;Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016\u0026rdquo;. These regulations banned zero rated services such as Free Basics which would have distorted the open and free internet and made our internet service providers interfere with our choices for online content.\nThis victory and India\u0026rsquo;s leadership on this issue has been acknowledged all over the world. This was only possible because of a large collective of volunteers, an engaged online community, the TRAI – so many organisations and individuals who all took leadership on this issue. We thank them all!\nIt is also important to see how this regulation has aged over time:\n Emerging consensus: Academic studies and analysis acknowledged the harmful effects of zero rated services over time. For instance a recent study analysed in a post over at EFF notes, \u0026ldquo;A comprehensive multi-year study by the non-profit Epicenter.works, comparing the 30 member countries of the European Union (EU) on net neutrality enforcement, has found that zero rating business practices by wireless carriers have increased the cost of wireless data compared to countries without zero rating.\u0026rdquo;. Thankfully, such services are prohibited in India. Complete net neutrality protections: The TRAI Zero Rating Regulation also signalled a principled acknowledgment of net neutrality in law. This has further been cemented by subsequent rounds of consultations and recommendations that have then been acted on by the Department of Telecom by making changes to license agreements. India today is arguably the world leader on comprehensive net neutrality protections in law that prohibit pricing (zero rating etc.) and technical discrimination (blocking, throttling etc.). We have much to thank for, but we must also now focus on action and enforcement. But what about enforcement?: While we celebrate let us also temper our optimism. Our victories can only be maintained and enjoyed with positive engagement on net neutrality enforcement. For instance, after disturbing reports emerged of network interference by ISPs of proxy and VPN web services we curated an online form which now has close to 150 detailed responses and we are examining a range of advocacy actions.  We are hopeful for collaboration on net neutrality advocacy and enforcement. We are open to all thoughts and suggestions on how to undertake effective advocacy actions. If you have any thoughts, suggestions, comments — more importantly want to commit time and help us — write to policy@internetfreedom.in. Over next week we will also start pro-actively reaching out to people on this issue and launching a range of actions.

This meeting invites representatives of Government and Twitter. Broaden participation: In line with our past representations when hearings were conducted on data breaches, privacy and to review the functioning of the UIDAI we are asking for greater public participation. This includes oral depositions by experts, academics, domain specialists, technologists and civil society groups. Move towards outcomes: We also indicate the need for the past hearings on these important subjects to lead towards outcomes. The mandate of the Parliamentary Committee on IT is to make recommendations to Parliment and the work and learnings gathered by depositions and submissions may perish if reports are not prepared and tabled before the next elections.  Analysis In continuation of our letters dated May 21, 2018, April 21, 2018 and **** April 5, 2018 and a formal memoranda and submissions we made on June 01, 2018 we continue to engage with the Parliamentary Committee on IT. We have today written to the Chairperson, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur and all the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Members appreciating the vital role that is played by it in informing the law making process issues of technology and human freedom.\nOur letter dated February 7, 2019 to the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Chairperson and members of the Committee on IT is available here.\nIn a digitally connected India the committee has assumed vital importance and held hearings on pressing controversies including, net neutrality; data protection and privacy; data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and overviewed the functioning of the UIDAI. Its next meeting on February 11, 2019 comes after a representation of allegations of bias of social media companies, specifically Twitter. Such hearings need to be broader and involve other platforms as well. But most importantly this hearing is correctly titled as, \u0026ldquo;safeguarding citizens\u0026rdquo; and we believe citizens should play a vital role in it. We believe that public, academic, civil society groups, domain experts and specialists are a vital component of this exercise. They need to be permitted the ability to make oral submissions which are right now restricted only to representatives of Government and Twitter.\nSecondly, over the course of the past three years the breadth of issues considered by the committee have been of vital public importance. However, any outcomes or recommendations which may form a report have not yet been made. As our board chair, Raman Chima has noted on the specific issue of data breaches and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, \u0026ldquo;a final outcome of this Committee\u0026rsquo;s deliberations on this important topic is also key, to ensure that Parliament remains relevant in how it seeks to protect privacy, rather than being overtaken by developments pushed by the executive and judicial branches of government.\u0026rdquo;\nWe will continue to engage with the committee as firm believers in public victories which are possible through institutional engagement.\nDocuments  Letter dated Feb 07, 2019 [link] Letter dated May 21, 2018 [link] Letter dated April 21, 2018 [link] Letter dated April 5, 2018 [link]  About us  Our Work: We are a civil liberties advocacy organisation focusing on technology and fundamental rights.

A summary of the reports is provided below and a data sheet has also been made available as we seek further data and request for collaboration from the wider net neutrality community in India as we continue pushing for enforcement.\nSummary of reports\n A total of 134 reports have been provided to us from the different cities and states spread across evenly over a 2 week reporting period. These include reports from major metropolitan cities and as well as smaller towns such as Siliguri, Udupi and Mindapur. We can reasonably infer this is a pan India problem. The reports primarily arise from users of mobile internet (64.4%). They are concentrated across two telecom operators which also have licenses to provide internet services. These are Reliance Jio with approximately 85 complaints and Airtel with 41 complaints. Other telcos and ISPs which also find mention are, ACT Fibernet, BSNL, Vodafone and Hathway. The reports on blocking of proxy and VPNs are concentrated for Jio. These include detailed statements which go beyond the blocking of pornographic websites or domains which may be blocked by interim injunctions by orders of courts. Most reports on Airtel conflate the blocking of pornographic websites but also state that it is blocking the Telegram domain (different from the usage of the app, or its download through an App store).  A version of the form which redacts the personal details of the respondents is available here.\nPreliminary Inferences\n Users are generally not aware of the reasons for network interference with websites and internet services in India. There are no clear statements or information available on the reason which may emerge from any legal order that is made available to them. They also are left wondering if this fault may be caused due to a technical error or may have commercial or regulatory interest attached to it. Further, there lacks any institutional process to gather or request such information in a standardised manner. There is a lack of any data gathering or reporting mechanism available for complaints about blocking and throttling. Hence, in the absence of any such system users are left to correspond with the consumer helplines of telecom operators which lack the technical ability and the incentive to address issues of systemic, network interference. It is not publicly known whether such monitoring even takes place by the Department of Telecom or by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.  We need enforcement to #SaveTheInternet\nThe extent of the complaints and our analysis indicates the need to press demands for the enforcement of India’s net neutrality protections.

It lacks any meaningful safeguards. These arguments are at the center of the case filed by IFF which is challenging the legality of the digital surveillance system before the Supreme Court of India.\nIn order to get to the bottom of this order and do something about it, IFF filed six RTIs seeking answers to the following rather basic questions:\n How many times has the government used its powers for interception? How many agencies have been authorized to intercept, monitor or decrypt data The names and the directions provided to the abovementioned agencies. Date, time and duration of meetings conducted by the Review Committee. How many times has the government received requests from different agencies seeking interception? (a) Number of requests denied. (b) Number of requests approved. How many times has an order been issued to prevent any offence which affects the sovereignty, integrity, defence or security of the state?Number of times order issued to investigate into an offence.  According to us, these are very reasonable queries which help us understand how surveillance practices are implemented in India. Their disclosure is primarily to infer broad operational trends and implement safeguards and they would in no way impact national security.\nWell, to our disappointment all six RTIs were rejected. The grounds cited are sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act 2005 on the grounds that ‘Disclosure of information related to lawful interception/phone tapping/monitor or decrypt is exempted’. This basically means that the government is unwilling to tell us who has access to all our private data and why they have access to it. If anything this reply confirmed, it was the complete secrecy and lack of oversight in digital surveillance by the Government of our personal data.\nNext steps? We will be filing an appeal against this denial and pursuing these RTIs to their logical conclusion.\nWe would also like to indicate that RTI Activist, Mr. Venkatesh Nayak (Coordinator, Access to Information, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative) has filed similar RTIs and received a similar rejection. He has recently penned a legal analysis on it at the Leaflet​.\nLink to documents\n​1.

We that very day published the full text of these proposed changes with an influential analysis that guided public debate.\n  A \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; consultation : Shortly after it, MEITY announced a public consultation on the proposed changes. These were proposals to make changes to the liability exemptions for online platform or service provider. An intermediary is any service providers which transmits, hosts and publishes user content. So it can be your ISP, email provider, social media platform, or any web-service which allows you to post, upload and publish. These platforms because of their technical ability to connect us to others, host our data, publish it, help us realise our freedom of speech, they mediate our online experience, impact our privacy and hold great power.\n  Recall these proposed changes, start afresh: Yesterday we sent our submission to MIETY noting the problems with the proposed changes. Our clear demand is that instant consultation with the proposed changes needs to be withdrawn. We fear this exercise is expending energy and resources on the basis of draft legal rules that lack any clear rationale that has been articulated by MEITY. The proposals themselves are substantively harmful to our fundamental rights as we explain in our submissions. We instead advocate for a fresh exercise with a white paper to update our legal rules. IFF believes that our government should protect people rather than merely seeking greater powers over a few dominant online platforms.\n  Analysis This has to be the most peculiar public consultation we have participated till now. Usually public consultation exercises are done with an approach paper or first trying to understand what specific harms, benefits, or policy objectives we are trying to fulfil. Only after that is done some legal provisions are identified for change or introduction. This is not the case with the consultation on the proposed changes to the Information Technology Intermediary Guidelines Rules, 2011 (the IT Rules). On December 24, 2018 the Indian Express put out a report that revealed some proposed changes were put in a private meeting to a select number of social media platforms and industry bodies.\nThe same morning we published the full text of these proposed changes. We noted problems early on with these proposed changes on grounds of privacy and free expression giving feedback rule by rule. This was widely covered by the press and became a major news story coming shortly after the MHA notification. Later in the evening that very day, MIETY announced a public consultation on the same rules. This was without any approach paper or explaining the rationale of the suggested changes. We found this to be not only strange, but also harmful to public confidence as internet users, who will face the impact of these changes the most were de-prioritised where feedback was first sought from large, private online platforms.\nWe object to the substance of these proposed changes which result in undermining our fundamental rights by turning online private intermediaries into policing agencies by – breaking encryption; empowering the government to gather more personal data; using risky automated filtering; and sending monthly reminders to behave ourselves. We clearly put across our demand to recall these proposed changes and end this consultation. It is not going to lead to any meaningful change or addressing the range of harms which today require a balanced policy conversation which should then move towards legal changes.\nThis is drawing scarce resources and time in a critical year for our digital freedoms. We need to seriously address issues of online content censorship, privacy, discrimination and due process. The present approach both in process and substance is misguided and even harmful.\nOur submission to MEITY can be found here\nOur detailed submissions emphasise on three principal pillars which are summarised below.\n Respect fundamental rights: MIETY must respect the fundamental rights of internet users and treat them as the primary stakeholders in this conversation. This flows specifically from according respect to the Shreya Singhal judgement, which not only struck down Section 66A as unconstitutional (which is not being complied with), but also according due respect to its directions on intermediary liability. Further, MIETY must act on the findings of the Committee on Subordinate Legislation to the 15th Lok Sabha which required changes to the Intermediary Rules to reduce vagueness. Act within the jurisdictional mandate: Second, most of the changes suggested are beyond the jurisdiction of MEITY. It must also remember the limited jurisdictional ambit as this present exercise is to change rules which can only be framed within the confine of the parent provision that is Section 79. Hence, making prescriptions for, introducing traceability that breaks encryption, automated filtering of user content or prohibiting the display of content such as vaping devices falls outside its jurisdictional mandate and results in further vagueness. Press for meaningful disclosure that leads to accountability: Third, to secure the fundamental rights of users the approach to take towards online intermediaries should start with meaningful transparency and accountability. Here, it is important for the public to know the processes, standards and internal decision making followed especially by large social media platforms. MIETY must urgently commence this process by requiring such disclosures that are made public on grounds of safeguarding the privacy and speech of millions of users who use the internet today. Operationalise the expert body tasked with this function: Fourth, the CRAC (Cyber Regulations Advisory Committee) which is a statutory body under the Information Technology Act, 2000 should be reconstituted with prominent membership of civil society organisations and should be tasked with coming up with a white paper on the future of the Information Technology Act, 2000. We believe that rather than diluting intermediary liability which requires to be safeguarded further protections to internet users is necessary.

Today, most of the roads around India Gate are blocked as we welcomed a row of tableaus for the Republic Day parade. It gives all Indians a chance to take pride in the progress we have made. This includes our growing leadership in information technology. But, even as we celebrate, concerns linger on an uncertain future. At present large swathes of online commentary are pessimistic in an ongoing wave of a \u0026ldquo;tech lash\u0026rdquo;. This comes with good reason with growing threats to our liberties and rights from large platforms and government.\nIn 2019, IFF views its mission seriously but with a sense of optimism. Over the past month, we have taken actions and made considerable progress to ensure our constitutional promises with technology \u0026ndash; of liberty, justice, fraternity and equality \u0026ndash; are realised. This is possible with the continuing generosity and affection we have received from a growing community of supporters.\nMore donors and volunteers are joining us! I am pleased to first note that more individuals continue to donate to us. Going from 6 donors in October 2018 we scaled to 45 individual donations in December 2018. This month we have touched 36 donors. Such grassroots support helps us grow in strength and capacity as we accelerate our work. It brings me great joy as I have noticed many people are donating every month. To ease friction, we will soon be rolling out an informal membership option where you can support our work with the option of a recurring contribution. While the total pool still does not match our needs, each donation is a source of pride. We need more donors and more help and I am confident we will be able to meet our financial goals to hire staff and build capacity to fight off threats.\nAs many of you have signed up to volunteer, we would like to update you on our continuing efforts to enable internet users to defend digital rights. We are building civic capacity by efforts to form a community which shares a passion for digital rights. To open up our work for engagement and review we are experimenting with a Slack group where we help curate conversations and discuss projects. Volunteers from the fields of technology, policy and parliamentary experts, litigators and academics are working in different workgroups and executing projects to a high degree of skill and expertise. Our engagement on social media and the community on Reddit has been an ongoing conversation of support and learning.\nEvery day more people offer IFF help. They send a kind note, make a donation, offer their time, even demand we do better [correct our typos :D].\nWe have been busy! Over the past month, we have taken a range of actions on the core domains that are part of IFF\u0026rsquo;s mandate.\n Privacy: On January 14, IFF went to the Supreme Court challenging the digital surveillance powers that enabled the MHA Notification authorising 10 agencies to collect your personal data. We argued that the system right now lacks any checks and balances. This is worrying as the government can collect and requisition our data arbitrarily. An important part of our petition is the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In our case, we have cited the fact that more than 11,000 people and 32 organisations support surveillance reform in India. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear our case and issued notice to the Government. Earlier in the month we revealed the full text of the proposed changes to the Intermediary Rules and put out an analysis on how it was taking us towards a china model of digital command and control. Throughout the winter session of parliament, we organised briefings for MPs and their offices on legislation that impact your privacy rights. Free Expression: As threats grow to online censorship through censorship codes, the revival of Section 66A (yes, we discovered it was still being used despite being ruled as unconstitutional!) and internet shutdowns, we fought back. Our work over the past month includes a court intervention by the People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) which relies on an IFF study, parliamentary briefings and notices to various bodies, particularly on online video streaming services. Surely, no one will want to watch a censored final season of the Game of Thrones? Net Neutrality and Innovation: To ensure that the existing net neutrality laws do not become a dead letter we have started examining options at enforcement and remedy. The first step in this is data collection. IFF has launched an online form to gather reports of blocking of VPNs and proxy websites. In addition to this our policy work continues. We are actively corresponding with government bodies and participating in TRAI consultations. For instance, in the latest OTT consultation we have asked TRAI not to license internet services and applications. Yes, we are not giving up on saving the internet!  Our work is towards action, that causes positive impact and public victories.

We submitted comments on 8th January 2019 and our counter comments yesterday night, i.e. January 21, 2019.\nHighlights:\n Licensing the Internet: The proposals pose a test of substitutability to assert that OTT and TSPs (telecom companies) provide similar services and that they should be regulated similarly. They say this is necessary for continued investment in network infrastructure. Questions on policy and economic basis: We found from data that the economic stress on telecos comes from the intense price competition they face due to extremely low prices of their competitors. There is also no clear data on the amount of investment needed in the sector. To pose regulation for internet services in the absence of not only causation, but even a credible correlation to economic losses of telecom companies is a harmful public policy choice. Protect users, not telecos and platforms: We call for legislative action and regulatory reform in the domains of privacy, consumer protection and competition law frameworks. When it comes to internet policy, end users are the most important stakeholders. TRAI\u0026rsquo;s consultation queries fall outside the jurisdictional scope of telecom regulation. At the same time we suggest that it must conduct a specific consultation on interception and surveillance reform in the telecom sector.  Analysis\nIn their consultation paper on Over-The-Top (OTT) Services, released on November 11, 2018, India’s telecom regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) resurfaced the issue of licensing of online services and platforms. We and others in the throes of the #SaveTheInternet movement made a clear demand that this should not be done. However, this proposal was today again surfaced as an issue which required a fresh round of consultation in a more structured manner indicating the need to protect the revenues and continued investment in the telecom sector.\nTo help you better understand this paper we made a brief summary and then we made a presumptive analysis and an economic analysis.\nFollowing this, IFF filed its comments with the regulator on January 8, 2019. We submitted that the paper set multiple faulty premises to pose queries and was thereby representative of inaccurate information which would lead to problematic regulations. To summarise:\n Firstly, the paper has applied a reductive definition of digital applications to catch them in a regulatory net, which will hamper end-user experience. They base their definition on a test of ‘substitutability’ which puts forward that these services are ‘functionally similar’ and therefore should be regulated the same. This test ignores context and would thereby also allow airplanes and trains to be regulated the same despite functioning in different contexts and thereby having different regulatory requirements. Secondly, it tries to argue that the regulatory imbalance between TSPs and OTT service providers is the reason that the telecom sector is under economic stress. This however is inaccurate as, one, the OTT services drive revenue for TSPs because of increased data charges and two, the economic stress is because of intense price competition between network providers. Thirdly, they address interoperability, lawful interception and emergency services and what OTT service providers should be regulated to do within these categories. With interoperability, we believe it should be regulated by competition law and consumer protection frameworks as it is outside TRAI\u0026rsquo;s mandate. Interception is a big issue in our country as we lack a proper privacy code to protect internet users and as a result in our comments we submitted that it was vital to establish this first before OTTs are required to do things like remove encryption. With emergency services, we believe that OTTs shouldn’t be mandated to provide these services because of the reductive definition applied meaning that a larger group of services would be pulled into this mandate unnecessarily.  Our submission to the TRAI can be found here.\nIn our counter comments, we have focussed our time on summarising the positions of service providers which happen to be telecom operators and an industry body which represents them. We have engaged and responded to arguments made by telecos that OTTs should have the same regulatory burdens imposed on them and maintained our stance of prioritizing the end-user, ensuring that freedom of speech and expression and your right to privacy are maintained.\nOur counter-comment submission can be found here.\nLink to our documents\n Summary and an analysis of the OTT Consultation Paper **** Financial spreadsheet of Telecos **** Submission of comments to the TRAI on the OTT Consultation Paper Submission of counter-comments to the TRAI on the OTT Consultation Paper  About us  Our Work: We are a civil liberties advocacy organisation focusing on technology and fundamental rights.

In a front-page report in yesterday\u0026rsquo;s Economic Times and a longer narrative present in The Ken, it has been revealed that IAMAI an industry body for internet companies, has developed a self-regulatory code and sought endorsement by the Ministry of Information \u0026amp; Broadcasting and the Ministry of Electronics and IT. Importing TV censorship to Internet streaming: Online video streaming services is a an evolving sector of discovery and choice for Indians. It is viewed privately increasingly on smartphones and offers diversity not available to audiences on television or cinema due to overbearing censorship. To import a TV style self-censorship system would tremendously hurt consumer choice and freedom of speech. Clear and present danger: We in our email and letter to the IAMAI have explained how this self-regulatory mechanism is bad for online streaming platforms, producers, artists and most importantly the audience. This will formalise a system of pre-censorship and subsequent complaints in categories of restricted content that will only grow in time. As per press reports the Government has not yet endorsed this measure and we are examining steps for them not to give it their, \u0026ldquo;endorsement\u0026rdquo;.  Our analysis This post is not about Game of Thrones, Sacred Games or Mirzapur. But it is. A lot of Indians are today turning off the television set and increasingly logging onto online streaming platforms. Here they are getting a wide diversity and choice of content that they had been denied till now. A lot of this has to do with the nature of online content streaming which also facilitates at its very core a wider range of ideas and expressions that have been heavily censored and prohibited in cinemas and on TV Channels.\nAt this crucial time, as per a report in yesterday\u0026rsquo;s Economic Times and The Ken, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) has proposed “Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers” and sought endorsement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry for Electronics and Information Technology (MIETY). As we set out in our letter of concern to IAMAI, we call on them to reconsider this proposal, it creates a de-facto censorship mechanism which will only become more pervasive in time. This will be to the detriment of the entire online video streaming sector.\nWhile some forms of self-censorship by individual platforms can fall within acceptable norms of international human rights norms, to have an expansive category that grows in time with a reporting mechanism will be visiting a harsher, TV style system.\nAs we have explained further in our letter this proposed system is modelled after a the Television self-regulatory system with similarity in some core features. This will tremendously harm freedom of speech and expression furthered through online web streaming platforms. Given there is no clear identifiable public policy objective and IAMAI is seeking not only a government endorsement, but also a ratification by which any complaints to the MIETY should be forwarded to the online video companies, we call for a rethink on this proposal. For a legal analysis on how self-censorship is harmful read this blogpost by the CCG, Delhi.\nAt present we have written to the IAMAI and are further examining steps to call on both the MIB and MIETY not to take further action on this. This becomes more important given that both government ministries have filed responses in different litigations indicating that there is no statutory power vested in them to exercise any censorship on online video streaming. This is a position which is consistent with our free speech guarantees under the Constitution of India though much more needs to be done to protect them.\nYes, we must not buffer TV censorship to online streaming platforms.\nDocument links  Our letter to IAMAI dated January 17, 2019 Reports by the Economic Times and The Ken Blogpost on self-censorship by online streaming platforms by CCG  About us  Our Work: We are a civil liberties advocacy organisation focussing on technology and fundamental rights.

IFF\u0026rsquo;s Petition: We - along with a batch of other petitioners - challenged the MHA Notification. IFF has also challenged the principal power of interception for computer systems under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act and the 2009 rules made under it. A case of sweeping significance: Our petition is aimed at greater reform and oversight of surveillance in India. As the worlds largest digital democracy, with the second highest number of internet users, we seek greater safeguards and believe it was necessary for us to file the first substantive judicial challenge on surveillance powers in our new digital society. Supreme Court issues notice: Today (January 14, 2019), the Supreme Court after hearing arguments by lawyers, including IFF\u0026rsquo;s lead counsel, Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, Senior Advocate was pleased to agree to hear the case. It seeks the government\u0026rsquo;s response in 6 weeks.  Preventing India from turning into a surveillance state A key pillar of our founding mandate is to ensure that informational privacy in the digital age is protected. To do this we often engage with the institutions of the state. For instance, on the legislative side, our #SaveOurPrivacy campaign includes a model law called the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which includes surveillance reform. Given that privacy is a fundamental right, in addition to having a statute (a law enacted by parliament), we also need to check the power of the government to snoop and bring accountability to the process.\nMany people wonder and say, that surveillance will not happen to them (click here to see how easy it is). But this is simply not true due to modern technologies which pervasively and persistently gather personal data of individuals. This is a problem which is further compounded by the wide powers of the Government which are concentrated in the executive branch of government to request, retain and collect this data. This power which was originally in place in the Indian Telegraph Act (which would ordinarily apply to telephone conversations) made its way to the Information Technology Act in Section 69.\nMany commentators in the past have noted that this is a problem. The orders for interception do not have any meaningful checks and balances. The entire process is opaque and this by itself tremendously threatens privacy. Now imagine this pre-existing power applying to all your digital data. It becomes incredibly frightening.\nThe need for judicial intervention\nWhen the Ministry of Home Affairs on December 20, 2018 issued a notification authorising 10 central agencies under Section 69 to conduct digital surveillance there was massive media outrage. Many termed it as an attack on our online privacy and with good reason. Some of this commentary can be found on our twitter thread and our previous post.\nSince these threads did not seem to be any closer to a remedy, it became clear to us that we would have to approach a court for remedy on behalf of the crores of Indians who are online and many more who are joining in every day. It was a question of their autonomy and ability to be free from the constant watch of a government, to enjoy liberty and their fundamental rights in a society that is increasingly digitized.\nIn this case, we joined with other petitioners (who filed their own independent petitions) including, M.L. Sharma, Amit Sahni, Mahua Moitra and Shreya Singhal. At present we are not precisely aware of the scope of their challenges, but to a large measure are confident they share cause in a challenge to over-broad, unaccountable surveillance. Our petition challenges, Section 69 of the Information Technology Act; the Interception Rules, 2009; and the MHA Notification and we are providing a public copy as a public charitable organization working on an issue of public interest.\nProceedings in the Supreme Court\nOur legal team is lead by Senior Advocate K.V. Vishwanathan who was assisted by a superb team of lawyers including Karan Lahiri, Vrinda Bhandari, Gautam Bhatia and Sai Vinod. Our advocate on record is Prateek Chadha. Working together they were today (in addition to other petitioners and their distinguished senior counsel) able to persuade the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Supreme Court in a bench presided by the learned Chief Justice of India, Shri Ranjan Gogoi to issue notice and require the government to file a response. This means this case will get heard by the Supreme Court and indicates hope towards the possibility of surveillance reform in India.\nWe will keep updating all of you on its progress. This is an incredibly important case for the future of digital privacy and we request everyone to pay close attention to it.\nDocument links  Public copy of the IFF Petition (Writ Petition (C) No. 44/2019).

This includes websites like Hide.me, VPNbook, Hidester etc. - all of which are websites that allow the user to mask their location to access information on the internet when the same is blocked in their area.\nThe principle of Net Neutrality (which now has regulatory backing in India through amendments to the licenses of telecom companies) holds that telecom companies which provide internet access and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are required to treat all data equally, not interfering with the access choices of the end user. Any provider selectively blocking VPNs and proxy service websites is extremely concerning as it contravenes this principle and violates Indian law.\nFurther, with the lack of a codified privacy law in India, blocking VPN sites completely leaves users devoid of any sort of privacy online, which means that any such action on a service provider\u0026rsquo;s part takes away a technical protection for one of our most essential fundamental rights.\nTo this end, we are putting out a Google Form to the public. The intention behind this form is to collect data on which websites are being blocked and by which ISPs, after which we will look through it and see how best to remedy the situation, by complaints, approaching the TRAI, the Department of Telecom, and other bodies as needed.\nSuffering a block?

Yesterday, IFF made its submission on it.\nHighlights:\n Licensing the internet: The proposals dangerously veer towards posing regulation on online services and platforms under a test of, “substitutability” with telecom services. The TRAI poses this may be necessary for continued investment in network infrastructure. **** Questions on policy and economic basis: We found from data that telecos are in a phase of intense price competition and these strains cannot be a justification for licensing or imposing regulatory burdens on internet services. This constitutes a faulty public policy proposal. **** Protect users, not telecos or platforms: At the same time we recognise the need for legislative action and regulatory action in the domains of privacy, consumer protection and competition law frameworks. When it comes to internet policy, internet users are the most important stakeholders. ****  On November 11, 2018 India’s telecom regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released the consultation paper on Over-The-Top (OTT) Services. A consultation paper is the usual method how it, provides a background and draws in comments from the public prior to forming a policy position. To help greater engagement we made a brief summary of this paper.\nA public consultation is an important exercise, it furthers transparency and engagement by people and stakeholders from different walks of life. For instance in the #SaveTheInternet movement for net neutrality in India more than a million people from all over India emailed TRAI and participated in an earlier public consultation.\nThe core submissions made in the #SaveTheInternet movement was to first protect net neutrality and second, to prevent licensing online platforms. Both of these objectives are tied to public welfare, better online services which provide value, innovation and protect the rights of individual internet users in India. Subsequently, the TRAI took a range of decisions from banning zero rated services, and making recommendations that become telecom licensing conditions to protect net neutrality. India in large credit to the stance of TRAI has become a world leader on net neutrality, though some concerns on its enforcement mechanism remain.\nThat said, the contentious issue of licensing of online service platforms and services remained. This was originally a proposal by telecom companies, which had argued in 2015 that they were suffering losses due to increased data use, and shift of users from SMS and Voice services to internet calls and messaging. This was subsequently shown to be incorrect as data revenues continued to rise. However, this proposal was still kept pending. Now, with the latest consultation paper on “OTT services”, which is a telecom industry vernacular the TRAI has again put the question of licensing and imposing regulatory burden on internet platforms and services.\nThis round of the stated justifications proceed on a slightly more nuanced basis however we fear their end would be the same. The TRAI has opened this round of consultations in the backdrop of falling revenues for telecom companies and the existing regulatory burden on them which may make continued investment in network infrastructure. At the same time with the growth of high speed mobile internet some would argue that 3G and 4G calling is, “substituting” voice calling and an SMS now being nothing more than a minority on smartphone usage which basks in the perpetual pings of internet messaging. This also comes against a backdrop of a growing, “tech-lash” in which sentiments of pessimism dominate the growing power of a handful of growing platforms. However, the basis for this consultation remains economic viability of the continued investment in telecom infrastructure.\nHere, it becomes important to take a step back and examine the economic premise individually before we proceed to each issue with the specificity that it demands. To do this, we did a bunch of things. We first made a summary of the paper and released it on social media which brought in a wide diversity of views. The communities at Reddit and Twitter were particularly helpful. Next, we put out our presumptive views and then, separately an economic analysis. The economic analysis mapped the earnings of all major telecom companies on a range of metrics, juxtaposed a variety of industry analyst reports and even statements of their own company heads. We came to the clear conclusion that there is little which will be achieved by licensing or imposing regulatory burdens of the telecom industry on online platforms and services.\nThis all flowed into our submission to the TRAI.\nFinally, we are aware that there is a regulatory need for intervention and even legislative action on online platforms and services. To us, this first, most immediately requires privacy protection. This has to include a comprehensive privacy law, but may also be supplemented by actions by the TRAI, particularly in the domain of surveillance reform as we have submitted often in previous rounds of submissions. There is also a need for India to examine the adequacy of its consumer protection and competition law frameworks as many countries are doing abroad. We again hope that India, the world\u0026rsquo;s largest digital democracy can take the lead as it did in net neutrality. We are optimistic and hope 2019 will see us engage with the challenges of growing digitisation which at its root is providing immense benefit to millions of Indians, at work, play and home.

This provision could not be used. But 66A is still used: As per an empirical study conducted in October by IFF it was shown that fresh 66A cases were still being registered. **** PUCL goes to Court: Due to growing concern on the impact of internet users and their freedom of speech and also due to undermining a court judgement PUCL went to Supreme Court asking for further directions to ensure all 66A cases stop and fresh ones are not registered. ****  Background On 31.10.2018, we had released a paper discussing a peculiar phenomenon obtaining in Indian law - the persistence of legal zombies: Statutory provisions that have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court but which continue to haunt our statute books.\nOur diving board was the fact that despite Section 66A of the Information Technology Act 2000 having been struck down as unconstitutional in 2015, persons have continued to be prosecuted under that provision. We argued that this was not simply because the executive branch was openly flouting constitutional norms and committing contempt of court, but rather, because of deeper institutional problems which resulted in judicial decisions not reaching state actors at the ground level. Even after this study was conduced numerous cases of subsequent Section 66A cases came to light in the media.\nAs we indicated we reached out to the People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) who were one of the leading petitioners in the batch of cases challenging Section 66A and which lead to the decision in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s hearing in the Supreme Court Today, i.e. Jan. 7, 2019 an application filed by PUCL sought further directions from the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The prayers in this application are:\n“(a) Direct Respondent No. 1 to ensure full compliance immediately with the judgment and final order dated 24.03.2015 in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, reported as (2015) 5 SCC 1 through issuance of appropriate circulars / advisories addressed to the Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories, and the Director Generals of Police of all States and Union Territories, or equivalent officers thereof;\n(b) Direct the Supreme Court Registry to dispatch a copy of the judgment and final order dated 24.03.2015 in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, reported as (2015) 5 SCC 1, to all High Courts to pass appropriate orders in pending cases concerning Section 66A of the IT Act as well appropriate circulars, bringing the Shreya Singhal judgement to the notice of all district courts within their jurisdiction to prevent failures of justice;\n(c) Direct Respondent No. 1 to collect and furnish data for all prosecutions invoking Section 66A after 24.03.2015 before this Hon’ble Court in order to secure compliance with the Shreya Singhal Judgement;”\nThis case registered as MA 3220/2018 in W.P. (Crl.) No. 199/2013 was argued by Mr. Sanjay Parikh, Advocate who was assisted by Advocates Sanjana Srikumar; Abhinav Sekhri; Apar Gupta and C. Ramesh Kumar, Advocate on Record before Court No. 6 in the Supreme Court of India before a bench of Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Justices Mr. Rohinton Nariman and Mr. Vineet Saran. The Hon\u0026rsquo;ble Court noting the seriousness of the matter issued notice and directed the Union Government who entered appearance to file a counter affidavit within 4 weeks and a further 1 week was granted for a rejoinder. We await for a confirmation on this through the court order which will become available towards the evening.\nIIF hopes that press reports about this case help prevent any further Section 66A proceedings during the pendency of proceedings. This is an unconstitutional provision - no past, present or future 66A should exist in the criminal justice system.\nIFF\u0026rsquo;s role in the proceedings IFF has not only supported research that provides a studied basis to reliefs sought in court but through its executive director appeared in the case and assisted PUCL in management and work execution. As indicated before IFF will continue to engage with courts for public outcomes on digital rights. We will collaborate, support and work with other organisations, groups and collectives.

To take down your posts “pro-actively” and by requiring traceability. Why is it being done secretly? Why are you not being involved?? We first explain what these rules do, then pose the top 5 concerns for users in a rule by rule analysis.\nDue to substantial public interest being at stake, we also are making available a complete copy of these draft rules here.\nWhat are the intermediary rules? These are rules called the Intermediary Rules, 2011 and are made under the Information Technology Act, 2000 that provide immunity for online platforms, ISPs - big, large, and tiny - for the content which is transmitted and published by end users. This allows these conduits of information to facilitate a core function of free expression and prevents them from throttling content or overbroad censorship which is termed as a, “chilling effect”. In return, they have to comply with legal requests for takedown of content and provide information on users - basically comply with the law. This was a principle recognised in Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (as amended in 2008).\nBut principal legislations such as Section 79 leave the details to subordinate rules. This is exactly what the Intermediary Rules are, which were made after public consultation around March, 2011. There was dispute on how this consultation was carried out, but still the draft rules were published online and comments were invited by the Ministry of Electronics and IT. However, these rules were unclear and vague. For instance, they did not clearly state what was, “actual knowledge”, and due to this in the Shreya Singhal case (yes, the Section 66A one), the Supreme Court said, that, “actual knowledge” came only when these platforms received a legal notice from the police or a court, not from private parties. So what is being changed? And what is at stake?\n5 Top Concerns\n1. On process: First let us start with how these draft rules are being made. This is a serious development and is eerily reminiscent of the calls for pre-censorship made in December, 2011. As reported by the Express the process is closed, being held between officials of the Ministry of Electronics and IT and a handful of large social media and messaging companies who have been allowed to give comments by January 7. But the changes as we go on to explain will impact users like you and me. It will impact our right to privacy and freedom of speech and expression. Why is the public being kept out?\n2. Breaking encryption: Draft rule, 3(5) introduces the requirement of traceability which would break end to end encryption. ****\n Many platforms (Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram but even other platforms) retain minimal user data for electronic information exchange and also deploy end-to-end encryption to provide reliability, security and privacy to users. These are used by millions of Indians to prevent identity theft, code injection attacks. Encryption becomes more important as more of life now involves our personal data. Without thought or involving technical experts in an open consultative process, without any data protection law or surveillance reform, this is being tinkered with by introducing the requirement of, “traceability”. This has important consequences for everyday users of online services and should also be seen in the context of the MHA notification which activates a 2009 rules which holds the power to direct, “decryption”. We do not have any proper parliamentary oversight or judicial check on surveillance and the latest draft rules, if they go through would be a tremendous expansion in the power of the government over ordinary citizens eerily reminiscent of China’s blocking and breaking of user encryption to surveil its citizens.  3. Longer even indefinite data retention: Draft Rule 3(8) increases the data retention period from 90 to 180 days and provides for further discretionary retention on the discretion of “government agencies”. The phrase, “government agencies” is not defined and the specific conditions or any outer limit for data retention at the end of the online platform is also not limited. Hence, by a mere letter by any government department, arguably a private platform can be required to store a users data indefinitely, without even letting this user know. It is important to remember that such retention will be even despite the user deleting the data on the servers of the intermediary. ****\n4. Pro-active censorship: Draft Rule 3(9) is the most dangerous bit which would be a sledgehammer to online free speech. Not abuse, harassment or threats, but legitimate speech by requiring online platforms to become pro-active arbiters and judges of legality (not their own terms of use which is a contract between the user and a platform). ****\n Placing such a requirement for a platform to obtain immunity from prosecution and actively sweep its platform would result in widespread takedowns without any legal process or natural justice. This violates the reasoning of the Shreya Singhal judgement which noted, “it would be very difficult for intermediaries like Google, Facebook etc. to act when millions of requests are made and the intermediary is then to judge as to which of such requests are legitimate and which are not.” It shifts the duty of the state to a private party. What is worse? It will be done by, “t_echnology based automated tools or appropriate mechanisms_”. Such tools have been shown to be faulty, have coding biases and prone to overbroad censorship. Should we subject our fundamental right to free speech on the basis of a developing technology measure? AI censorship is the Chinese model of censorship.  5. The nanny requirement: Draft Rule 3(4), inserts a monthly requirement (at the least) to inform users about the legal requirements such as the terms and conditions and privacy policy. At first blush this may seem as a needed measure, with rampant online abuse and trolling. But consider the change in the environment from a public part to a guarded school yard in which you are constantly reminded that you are under watch and you better behave yourself. It will turn the internet in India into a corporal environment which is bad for users. Rather than letting market mechanisms figure out a notification for good conduct, which is in the best interests of platforms themselves, such a measure by law will require product side changes for smaller startups and entrepreneurs as well. ****\nThere are many more problems which will comment and analyse during the day and the coming week.\nAt IFF we believe there are better ways to check misinformation and threats to Indian elections. These can be achieved as per our fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The instant proposals seen alongside the recent MHA notification activating the 2009 interception rules is taking India close to a Chinese model of censorship. Yes, online platforms are problematic, they require fixes. But driving changes through a closed and secretive process in which measures that undermine fundamental rights is a harmful approach for all of us.\nTo us the path to disinformation is by first checking and bringing in a comprehensive privacy law which brings the power and control of smartphones in the hands of ordinary Indians. This will help bring accountability to large data controllers, from online companies which target us with advertising that is used by political parties. We also need to focus on steps and support the Election Commission. But right now, today, we all need to do is push back and speak up to #SaveOurPrivacy and #RightToMeme\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/india-must-resist-the-lure-of-the-chinese-model-of-surveillance-and-censorship-intermediaryrules-righttomeme-saveourprivacy/","summary":"As reported in today’s front page story in the Indian Express, why is the government and large online platforms are privately discussing how  to censor and break encryption of your social media and messaging.

The second marks how surveillance works at present and the incumbent problems. In conclusion, this piece examines the government response and prompts a thought on the needed solution. To properly understand the Ministry of Home Affairs order, one has to step back in time to look at the riveting history of surveillance reform that emerges from tales of political intrigue.\nHow it all started Due to the fractious politics of the early 1990s, politician and former prime minister Chandra Shekhar accused the VP Singh government of illegal phone tapping of opponents. These disclosures led to India’s pre-eminent human rights organisation the People’s Union for Civil Liberties approaching of the Supreme Court. It was discovered that no procedure, or even proper safeguards existed for telephone tapping.\nThe court laid down certain guidelines in its decision in 1996. During arguments, there was a specific suggestion for judicial oversight, which was rejected. These guidelines became an important marker that must be examined in the context of that time - keeping in mind the prevalent technology, then a fixed-line telephone, and the volume, nature and extent of personal information. The court’s guidelines were later formally placed in the Telegraph Rules with the insertion of Rule 419-A. This became the operative structure for telephone tapping.\nSystemic Rot Over the years, these guidelines have proved to be ineffective. Phone tapping scandals continued to arise, pointing to design faults – ranging from the lack of independent oversight of interceptions, to agencies which were not under any parliamentary supervision or control. Incidents, such as allegations made by Amar Singh or the Radia Tapes, evidenced a systemic rot but they were limited to political personalities, or sometimes industrial espionage, and the popular argument for surveillance reform lacked a broader constituency. There were also counter arguments of state security and anti-terrorism measures made in support of surveillance.\nRepeated calls for reform have been made over the years. The Justice AP Shah Committee on Privacy included recommendations on this issue and the Department of Personnel and Training even commenced an exercise to draft a comprehensive Privacy Act which (as per leaked versions) included such reforms. However, till date there have been hardly any meaningful changes in India’s government surveillance framework to check abuse and to protect individual rights.\nAs per India’s telecom regulator, about four in ten Indians today have a smartphone. These devices are a passport to the digital world that is making our lives better via pervasive data gathering. This knowledge exchange is not only conducted by large global online platforms but also government services. The amount of personal information available on handheld devices today is unhindered by technical capability or even economic cost as data storage and acquisition costs continue to drop. Economically and socially, personal data, is not the new ‘oil’ as many have put it, it is power over the way people think, act and function.\nNew rules, old abuse The rules for digital surveillance were made in 2009 by the Central Government and included a specific power under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act.\nThough this power had existed since 2000, when parliament first legislated the IT Act, its scope was expanded by an amendment in 2008. These changes and the 2009 rules focused on data acquisition from large online platforms which serve as digital honeypots for governments. The rules are closely modeled on the telephone tapping framework and follow a similar model – but they extend it further in terms of power.\nFor instance they permit surveillance in terms of monitoring data traffic of an individual or class of persons, or relating to any subject and via more than one computer resource. The IT rules claim constitutionality in the Supreme Court decision in the 1997 telephone tapping case, which did consider an expanded spectrum of personal data acquisition.\nThere are deviations but in contrast with the telephone tapping and the digital snooping rules, it is a clear inference that the scope of power and acquisition of personal information is deeper, wider and more pervasive. Digital snooping pierces the skull into the range of human emotion, it cuts to the bone to the mildest kinesis of physical action.\nMeanwhile the safeguards are extremely deficient and bear the same design flaws of the telephone tapping architecture. The agencies who should be tasked with surveillance have still not been created by parliamentary enactments, there is concentration of power in the executive branch and illegally gathered data is admissible as evidence in court cases as there is no necessity for judicial warrants. Little or no safeguards exist as recommended most notably by the Justice AP Shah Committee report on privacy.\nA weak defence by the Government On Friday, when a political maelstrom broke out, the Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs made a spirited defence which deserves some examination to understand the path ahead. Elements of this defence were contained in the parliamentary reply, a blog post, and a clarification issued through a press statement by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Let’s look at it threadbare from the point of legality and accuracy rather than apportioning blame to political parties.\nThe first point is that the notification that authorises 10 central agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt all data contained in any computer, is only a continuation of past practice. It is routine and has been followed even prior to 2009. This omits to consider that the earlier powers and requisition of personal information for telephone tapping were limited as compared to the expanse of digital snooping. It also does not consider that the notification, a fresh one, infact activates 2009 rules - as no earlier such notification existed to empower intelligence agencies. What was pre-existing were notifications for telephone tapping under Rule 419-A of the Telegraph Rules. This is a new development even if the context for it was created years ago.\nThe second point - that the notification is necessary for protecting individual rights, as, without it, police officers were acting beyond the purview of law. It bears repetition, that, if they were, any such action was unconstitutional. Without authority, such interception, monitoring and decryption could not be carried out itself. Hence when viewed holistically the MHA notification activates broad powers in favour of ten central agencies to send requisitions to the Ministry of Home Affairs. It ultimately is a fresh development which tremendously expands their powers from tapping telephones to fine grains of our digital data.\nThe third justification was that this notification was necessary for intelligence agencies to prevent acts of terrorism. There is little quarrel here with the objective. Terrorism hurts people and we need to secure our country. What is in dispute is the proportionality of the legal power to achieve these objectives. Only in August, 2017, nine judges of the Supreme Court laid down an authoritative judgment on the right to privacy whose majority opinion stresses on heightened safeguards for individuals and tougher scrutiny for officials. Even the majority Aadhaar decision, which came as a disappointment for many activists, recognises the role of judicial warrants which require a judge’s signature. This is in recognition that the telephone tapping safeguards may be proper in 1996 as per the court. However, times have changed. Legal doctrine has evolved to recognise that a smartphone requires a smarter approach and safeguards to surveillance.\nHence, rather than reviewing the 2009 rules, the government activated them. This was not a continuation of a past practice, but a fresh one which expanded previous abuse. Even if the notification is just a continuation of past practice, it has perpetuated a broken system prone to abuse.\nThe government’s approach is not surprising, given that the the Ministry of Electronics and IT is considering the Justice BN Srikrishna drafted Draft Data Protection Bill that does not pose any legal intervention on surveillance. A separate report authored by them disingenuously hides behind incoherent arguments and legal doctrine in marking this task to a separate initiative, ignoring the practical reality of threat to privacy arising both from the private and the public spheres of data gathering.\nWhat is the fix?\nIt is a comprehensive privacy law such as the Indian Privacy Code. The MHA notification is only one in a range of government programs, many which we do not fully know about, that are building surveillance capabilities. These will no longer target those who wield or aspire for power, but more ordinary people, minorities and the poor who lack resources to safeguard themselves. As concerned citizens, while there may be many versions of the specific minutiae of legality, it should be our common claim that data protection is incomplete without surveillance reform.\nWithout, it India will become a surveillance state. We will keep pushing to #SaveOurPrivacy.

We argued that this was not simply because the executive branch was openly flouting constitutional norms and committing contempt of court, but rather, because of deeper institutional problems which resulted in judicial decisions not reaching state actors at the ground level.\nOne of the reasons for this, we argued, was the failure of any synergy between declarations of unconstitutionality by courts and corresponding actions by Parliament. Basically, even after the judiciary declared a law as unconstitutional, it remains present on the statute books unless the legislature passes an amendment to give effect to this decision and strike out the bad provision. Thus, we highlighted how Section 66A of the IT Act, as well as Section 303 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 - struck down in 1983 - are still there in the texts of these statutes. In this regard, we highlighted that while commercially published copies of the statutes carried an asterisk or other indicator mentioning the fact that the concerned provision had been struck down, no such indicators were present in the official version of these texts as available on Indiacode.\nImpact and action by Government As of October 31, our claim was accurate. However, doing a recent search we discovered that the Government had updated the electronic copies of both the IT Act and the IPC on November 6, 2018 (these can be confirmed by the metadata in the PDFs) that are published on Indiacode. Now the changes are as follows:\n Page 24 of the IT Act on Indiacode now has Section 66A with a footnote (fn 1), stating “Section 66A has been struck down by the Supreme Court’s Order dated 24th March, 2015 in the Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India, AIR 2015 SC. 1523”. Page 71 of the IPC on Indiacode __ now has Section 303 with a footnote (fn 2), stating “Section 303 has been struck down by Supreme Court’s order dated 7 th April, 1983 in the Mithu, Etc., Etc. vs. State of Punjab Etc., Etc. 1983 AIR 473, SCR (2) 690”.  Though these are welcome developments, adding a footnote does not change the fact that text still contains Section 66A, and that can only be done via amendment. __ Besides, the Government has unfortunately made a hash of getting this simple task of adding footnotes right. Not only has the concerned person not even bothered to properly write the footnote for Section 303 IPC to properly cite Mithu, instead choosing to copy the case name as it appears on IndianKanoon, but they have forgotten to add references to the most recent declarations of unconstitutionality in the IPC realm, i.e., the partial striking down of Section 377 IPC (page 88 of the IPC text), and the complete striking down of Section 497 IPC (page 108 of the IPC text). Incidentally, both of these were also cited in our paper.\nWe intend to do more What does this tell us? Besides confirming that someone only read the parts of the paper that came in the news, it confirms our major claim: That band-aid fixes are not the answer to this problem. The problem is not simply about timely housekeeping and adding citations, but about systemic gaps of communication between the branches of state, and within the judiciary itself. Unless the political will is mustered to tackle this problem in the considered way it requires, the situation will probably continue looking like an attempt at treating the symptoms while ignoring the festering disease.\nWe were served a reminder of this when only yesterday we were made available a FIR registered on 14.11.2018 under Section 66-A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (in addition to Sections 153-A and 295-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860). This is only one instance out of many, in which a cloud of censorship and the fear of imprisonment is threatening scores of young indians who are discovering smartphones and the Internet. A copy of this FIR is available below.\nTo us, the task is clear. We need to press for further relief and have reached out to the __ People\u0026rsquo;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) who were one of the leading petitioners in the batch of cases challenging Section 66A and which led to the decision in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India. We encourage people to support them and get involved.\nWe hope, that more young Indians are not jailed, prosecuted and put through the rigours of criminal trial on the anvil of an unconstitutional provision. To us this is a deep institutional stain on the marble of our pillars of justice which must be bleached. Section 66A must die a complete constitutional death.\nIf you know of any fresh Section 66A cases, please do contact us by email at policy@internetfreedom.in.

But the reason, for it being so widely used is that it accurately describes positive movements and public victories \u0026ndash; right when things look like they won\u0026rsquo;t change.\nThis fits perfectly with the ongoing civil society efforts on Net Neutrality and Internet shutdowns. On both these issues the Department of Telecom (DoT) has taken positive steps which need to be supported and extended with further action.\nNet Neutrality As we had indicated in our previous update the DOT\u0026rsquo;s action for license amendments has now brought in firm, legal rules to safeguard net neutrality in India. We need to safeguard the intent of these amendments and also address areas which still require regulatory clarity. This is most particularly felt with respect to devising a transparent and public reporting mechanism for notifying net neutrality violations in India.\nInternet Shutdowns As reported by the Wire in our ongoing advocacy on this issue, we have through an RTI been provided with a letter dated 28.09.2018 issued by the DoT that says two significant things. First, it acknowledges that internet shutdowns is a problem, second it asks State Governments and Union Territories to issue such orders with restraint. But much more needs to be done.\nFurther action by IFF We yesterday wrote a letter to the DoT requesting for their time to have digital rights placed on the agenda for 2019. From further measures on Net Neutrality to the creation of a centralised, transparent system of data gathering of internet suspensions and also requested for an open public consultation on the legal rules which as per us are not only unconstitutional but also operationally problematic.\nPublic victories build incrementally With the victory in the Rajasthan High Court, increasing parliamentary scrutiny and now this letter/advisory, there is real hope that India will emerge from internet blackouts into dawn. Our continuing victories on internet shutdowns are possible due to the actions of individuals such as Dhirendra Rajpurohit and his team of lawyers; SFLC.in who has built an influential tracker and filed RTIs to document their frequency, number and process; Research organisations such as CIS, CCG, DEF, FII, IDP, ICRIER\u0026rsquo;s influential study on their costs, and a recent analysis by GenderIT.\nThe power of citizen engagement In April, 2017 more the 15,000 people and 80 organisations signed the #KeepUsOnline petition last year against internet suspensions and voiced their concern against them. Due to their support we have had modest success and are optimistic for further steps by Government to ensure a positive movement for greater internet access. Working together we will keep winning for our constitutional rights to a free and open internet.\nIf you would like to support IFF consider a donation and volunteering.\nLink to our Documents:  RTI Application No. DOTEL/R/2018/51130 dated December 3, 2018 Response from the DOT dated 07.12.2018 Letter dated December 17, 2018 to the Secretary, DOT  About us  Work: The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) is a civil liberties non-profit working on technology and fundamental rights.

New Date for submissions is now 07.01.2019. Counter comments is 21.\nOne of the core questions in the ongoing OTT consultation paper floated by the TRAI are the revenue losses by large telecom companies which would impair future telecom network investment. There has always been an underlying sentiment in such conversations on placing the blame on internet platforms and services that somehow have stolen profits from telecom companies by voice calling and instant messaging services. This builds into arguments for levying some form of a toll to \u0026ldquo;compensate\u0026rdquo; telecos for their losses.\nWe examine multiple strands of this argument on the basis of financial data to examine whether there is any truth to this. Has a growth in the use of online calling and messaging hurt telecom revenues in India?\nData sheet of Telco Financials\nWe first invite you to view a data sheet broken across quarters that maps the financials of the sector based of TRAI data, and three large telecom companies, Airtel, Idea and Reliance Jio.\n Link to the financial spreadsheet available over at Google Sheets You can also read our summary and an analysis of the OTT Consultation Paper over here.  A preliminary analysis\nWe call this a preliminary analysis because this requires inputs and peer review. We encourage you to send any thoughts or comments you may have on this to policy@internetfreedom.in. All of this will be considered in our final submission to the TRAI. From our knowledge and understanding, such an exercise has not yet been done in the consultation paper, or is publicly available. Even though we have taken care in our number crunching, we would appreciate financial and telecom experts to weigh in.\nGrowth in use of both voice and data across the sector\nLet us first start with the basics. What have been the growth trends in voice and data use across operators? Both voice and data usage have seen a significant increase in the past few years. The sharp rise also coincides with the launch of Jio\u0026mdash;as an example, industry-wide voice usage saw a 2% year-on-year fall in 16Q2, but since then has increased by 166% (Graph 1).\n  \u0026ldquo;Graph 1 - Growth in voice calling\u0026rdquo;\n  Also, the growth of data usage has been spectacular. Again this sharp rise has been since 16Q2 which is when Reliance Jio has launched services. Do notice this is against all teleco operators as is also evident from TRAI data which shows an increasing rate of quarter on quarter growth (Graph 2).\n  \u0026ldquo;Graph 2 - Growth in usage per user\u0026rdquo;\n  Is there financial stress in the Telecom Sector?\nThere are two core metrics to understand revenue and profitability in the telecom industry. The first is ARPU (average revenue per user) defined as the total revenue divided by the number of subscribers. Three graphs below give the aggregate ARPU for all services provided by Telecos (Graph 3).\n  \u0026ldquo;Graph 3 - ARPU\u0026rdquo;\n  We have sub-divided into VARPU (voice average revenue per user in Graph 4) and DARPU (data average revenue per user in Graph 5).\n  \u0026ldquo;Graph 4 (VARPU) \u0026quot;\n    \u0026ldquo;Graph 5 (DARPU)\u0026rdquo;\n  It is again important to consider that the numbers change drastically after Jio’s launch in 16Q2. Industry-wide ARPU saw a year-on-year increase of 5% for 16Q2, a quarterly decline of 15% by 16Q3, and a year-on-year 33% decline for 17Q2.\nThe same trends can be seen in data and voice ARPU, which were relatively stable until 16Q2 and then saw a precipitous fall. Airtel stopped disclosing both in their quarterly reports in 17Q2.\nThe fall (quarter-on-quarter, of 15% for Airtel and 14% for Idea) in 17Q3 is to a large extent attributable to TRAI reducing the interconnect usage charges from 14 paisa to 6 paisa. In their quarterly reports, Airtel says this accounts for an 11% fall in ARPU.\nThe second metric to measure the health of telecom firms is EBITDA. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is a measure of a company\u0026rsquo;s operating performance. Essentially, it\u0026rsquo;s a way to evaluate a company\u0026rsquo;s performance without having to factor in financing decisions, accounting decisions or tax environments. We have set this out in Graph No. 6 below.\n  \u0026ldquo;Graph 6 : EBITDA\u0026rdquo;\n  As with everything prior, there is a noticeable change in trends around 16Q2 (when telcos started aggressively pricing their plans and providing unlimited voice bundles with data plans). As with ARPU, the fall (quarter-on-quarter, of 11% for Airtel and 19% for Idea) in 17Q3 is to a large extent attributable to the reduction in the interconnect usage charges. In their quarterly reports, Airtel says this accounts for a 4% fall in EBITDA, while Idea says this accounts for a 15% fall in EBITDA.\nWhat is the amount of money necessary for network investment and upgradation?\nThis is another aspect where not a lot of data exists publicly. We only have some estimates to proceed on how much money will be necessary and how it will be used. This is the tricky part, as it is part projections\u0026hellip; proceeding on multiple variables without access to proper and full data.\nThe only rough estimate we could find was to just use the capex (capital expenditure) figures of telecom companies from the quarterly reports (See Graph 7). Even this is not clear as to how much goes towards building data networks. For instance the Idea reports here at least explicitly say that \u0026ldquo;the majority of this goes towards 4G expansion\u0026rdquo;.\n  \u0026ldquo;Graph 7 : CAPEX\u0026rdquo;\n  Idea also reports the number of 2G and 3G+4G cell sites they added that quarter. This is also graphed up (See Graph 8). We acknowledge that, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to get a more specific picture, but then if there is an actual need for investment, a clear, public statement with data should be made.\n  \u0026ldquo;Graph 8: Number of sites added\u0026rdquo;\n  At the same time there are other independent programs specific to telecom players such as Airtel\u0026rsquo;s [Project Leap](is also deploying a range of innovative technology solutions including small cells, indoor solutions, Wi-Fi hotspots and carrier aggregation technologies to improve network experience inside buildings. ) announced in 2016 with a plan for an investment of 600,000 million rupees over the next three years. So far the gross capex is Rs. 387,546 mil, and a year\u0026rsquo;s left. Airtel also has a capex forecast of Rs. 250,000 mil for this year of which it is roughly halfway there at Rs. 128,213 mil. Vodafone Idea (not just Idea \u0026ndash; the merged entity) has a capex guidance for Rs. 270,000 mil, ) for the next year.\nSo whats the verdict?\nThree preliminary inferences can be made from the data:\n Massive growth post 16Q2: Both voice calling and data use are growing across the sector. This explodes after 16Q2 which is when Reliance Jio starts services. The rate of growth is increasing and more people are coming online. Fall in average rate per user: This massive growth has coincided with a drop in per user revenue for the major telecom players. Such fall appears to be due to a hyper-competitive environment after the entry of Reliance Jio, however with a wave of consolidation this period may soon end. Such trends are as per statements in the press by leading executives of telecom companies and analyst reports such as Moody\u0026rsquo;s and Fitch. Ambiguity in the amount of investment: While there is a need for continued investment, we do not know to what extent, to what number and in what period of time. The data here is spotty and while the number may be large to devise any public policy measure there needs to be evidence.  What the data also discloses is that we cannot keep blaming increased data use for a fall in profitability for telecom companies any longer. Statements by major telecom companies usually attribute multiple correlations, but the overwhelming consensus is hyper-competition. As per analyst reports this is slated to end sometime next year (latest by QY20) when the sector enters a period of consolidation given that only three major telecom companies will exist (Airtel, Idea-Voda, Reliance Jio).\nWe hold a preliminary view that devising regulations to place regulatory burdens or financial levies on internet platforms and services by itself is not a sound public policy measure from the perspective of data. The objective of regulation should not be to protect the profits of companies, it should be to serve public welfare.

Second, apart from Ministry, who all are reviewing the comments and re-drafting the law.\n  With regard to the details of the comments, the response was only limited to the number of submissions received (624) and no other information was provided.

New Date for submissions is now 07.01.2019. Counter comments is 21.\nWhy have you created this public analysis?\nThis is a public analysis for TRAI’s Consultation Paper on OTT [Over-The-Top] Consultation released on November 12, 2018. ‘OTT’ is an acronym that sounds dull, dry and technical \u0026ndash; we suspect just so that our eyes glaze over it \u0026ndash; and we stop paying attention. But this matters as this consultation has the potential for important regulatory changes that will impact how you use your internet platforms and services in future. So we ask you to pay attention. This consultation is important to all of us.\nWhat is in your analysis on the OTT Consultation?\nRemember the net neutrality campaign and how you decided to speak up? This consultation paper is a part of the same work. While some parts of net neutrality were addressed, a dangerous proposal to license online services and platforms has persisted. This won’t be limited to the Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft of the world (more specifically, India) but will have an impact on small and medium-sized startups, and even directly impact your online choices and how you use the internet.\nIn our analysis, we list out the key questions and pose lines of inquiry. These all start from examining the rationale of the paper, which is to ensure two principal objectives. The first is to make sure that there is a continued economic investment in telecom and data networks in India. The second is to cure any regulatory imbalance which exists between telecom services and their internet based counterparts (and if they can be considered as substitutes). There is tremendous complexity in the several strands of arguments which are served in a helpful and accessible manner by the TRAI, but there exists a considerable amount of public concern as the principal proposals themselves may cause massive harm by the introduction of licensing or registration requirements.\nAnother area which is dealt in the TRAI paper is the discussion on lawful interception of the internet based voice calls and messages, which are often secured by end-to-end encryption; and another is placing a requirement for providing emergency calling services on relevant services. Though, both these issues may seem somewhat independent to the primary thrust of the paper, they arise from the licensing requirements on telecom companies and hence, the TRAI is seeking comments on whether they should be extended to OTT service providers as well. This very well has the potential to break end-to-end encryption in instant messaging applications such as Signal, Telegram and Whatsapp.\nIn our analysis we focus on the top concerns, zoom in on the lines of inquiry and help prompt thinking on a digital rights approach to the OTT Consultation Paper.\nClick here to read our summary __ and_ here to read our analysis (google docs)._\nSo what are you doing about the OTT Consultation?\nWe are hoping to help spread awareness and public participation in a technical process which is dominated by experts, companies and industry associations. We are creating a series of guides, aimed at reducing jargon and explaining the impact and implications of this consultation. This is in an open and transparent manner, which helps us learn from the feedback of our supporters and volunteers.\nTo build civic capacity we have a three step model, (1) where within 24-48 hours, we rapidly create an authentic summary (no opinion or commentary), (2) as step two, we publish our analysis within a week or two (broad strokes and key concerns), and (3) then as the final step publish a draft of our formal inputs (detailed submissions) for public comments before sending it out as a formal submission.\nWe do all of this in plain English (hopefully in future in other Indian languages as well) and invite anyone on the internet to peer review our work. Our hope is to have the capacity to do this for any and all consultations and regulatory processes which impact digital rights in India. For this, we ask for your help.\nClick here to read our summary __ and_ here to read our analysis (google docs)._\nWhat can you do to help?\n Speak up and participate: Spread the word on this consultation. Write an article, make a video (reach out to us if you want us to promote it). We hope our documentation helps you draw up your own responses to this consultation, and if, that is too much work, you can freely use parts of our summary, analysis and forthcoming detailed comments to send a response to the TRAI. While this may not drum up big numbers, it brings a greater level of individualisation and diversity in responses. This also helps us check what works for people, and how we can make it better. Volunteer: We also need more volunteers to build this analysis out into detailed comments. For this, list out your specific skills and indicate how much time you will be able to devote to us. We see volunteer work as something through which we can learn and provide people an experience which is satisfying. Right now, for the OTT consultation, we are looking for people with an expertise in crunching numbers and familiar with reading financial disclosure documentation of Indian telecom companies.

The person to thank for this is Dhirendra Singh Rajpurohit, who runs a hardware store in Jodhpur. Dhirendra, you are an internet hero. We salute you and your team of lawyers!\nWhat happened ?\nA few months ago, Dhirendra suffered a disruption to his life and work due to internet shutdowns in Jodhpur. He was aware of the public interest in the issue. The frequent disruptions were caused to prevent cheating in entrance examinations for the conduct of the Rajasthan Police Recruitment examination. Aggrieved by it, he filed a writ petition on it in the High Court.\nWhile initially the Rajasthan state government in its reply resisted the writ petition, subsequently in its additional affidavit it recanted. It stated that its department of Home Affairs had issued a set of departmental instructions to all the Divisional Commissioners in Rajasthan to cease making orders to shutdown the internet for examinations. It almost seemed that Rajasthan Government was spurred into such action by Dhirendra\u0026rsquo;s petition because this seemed to completely satisfy the reliefs.\nIn view of this nothing remained to be argued, and the High Court disposed off his petition on November 28, 2018. Without the need for arguments Dhirendra scored an incremental, yet important judicial victory against Internet Shutdowns in India.\nWe encourage our more detail oriented readers to either go through the bare case pleadings and the court orders that we have made available online. This is with the objective of putting out these public documents for wider release and transparency. We also want to thank Harsh and Akash for volunteering their time and skills. We also have a translated copy of an important letter issued by the Home Affairs Department of Rajasthan.\nWe also encourage people to follow the detailed post over at SFLC.in. They have been running an influential shutdown tracker which is built off media reports and RTI responses and has been a data point for establishing that India has the highest number of internet disruptions, globally. This is a national shame, and this is why this case and the outcome in it becomes important.\nWhy is it an \u0026ldquo;incremental\u0026rdquo; victory?\nBecause internet shutdowns can, and will still keep happening. Yes, even in Rajasthan.\n  A limited challenge lead to a limited victory: This is because Dhirendra\u0026rsquo;s petition only challenged the exercise of the power of internet disruptions in a specific case (a specific order due to the conduct of examinations), not the legal rules (Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017) which permitted it. As per us these rules which permit shutdowns are per se unconstitutional as a shutdown is disproportional and blocks legitimate speech. We have also supported research on how these rules are badly phrased and were created in a process of absolute secrecy. These rules continue in operation and we can expect internet shutdowns in future, albeit with decreased frequency and not for competitive examinations at-least in Rajasthan.\n  The result of a concession: The order of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court is the result of a concession by the State Government. This is an important step forward in court centered advocacy actions in India which is the world leader on internet shutdowns. It shows the Government overreach can be corrected by judicial intervention, so while the order is not a extensively reasoned judicial opinion, it is a modest victory. In time all of these add up for greater impact and show the strength of citizens who fight for their fundamental rights in the digital age. We would specifically like to thank Dhirendra\u0026rsquo;s lawyers, Nitin Goklani and Pravin Vyas, Advocates for conducting this case and ensuring a positive outcome. We would also like to thank Advocate Abhishek Mehta, who was following up and updating us on the case proceedings.\n  Concerns remain: This case was disposed off due to letter dated 22.10.2018 which is recorded in the Order of the High Court. This letter while it records, \u0026ldquo;to stop shutting down the Internet during any kind of exam in the state\u0026rdquo; which forms the basis of the High Court order. But it is important to take a step back and look at who was ordering these shutdowns? The answer to this is in the letter which states that, \u0026ldquo;the State Government has authorised all Divisional Commissioners through an Order dated 02.09.17\u0026rdquo;. Now it becomes important to go into the issue whether these Divisional Commissioners are allowed to do this as per the legal rules? As per us, the answer is no. Divisional Commissioners cannot be delegated authority which is fixed under Rule 2 of the Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017.\n  So while the overall result is positive, we will keep pressing on with the follow up to our #KeepUsOnline campaign which gathered 15,000 individual and 80+ organisational sign-ups last year.\nWhat is IFF doing about it?\nA few things. After preparing a legislators brief, we have been reaching out to the offices of many lawmakers across party lines to have conversations on issues of digital rights in which internet shutdowns features prominently. We are also exploring other parliamentary strategies for the Winter and Budget sessions working with a team of volunteers including Arpitha, Hardik, Akash and many others.\nAt the same time we have filed a fresh RTI with the Department of Telecom, specifically asking them on whether any advisories or departmental orders have been issued by them to curtail shutdowns. We will be picking up pace in our work and are hopeful that we can ensure important wins for the public on digital rights next year.\nWe have also sent a legal notice to the Government of Rajasthan stating that their Order dated 02.09.2017 sub-delegating authority for internet shutdowns to Divisional Commissioners is illegal and should be withdrawn.\nIf you would like to support IFF consider a **_ donation _** _and_ **__** _volunteering_**_._**\nLink to Documents\n Drive link of case pleadings Translated version of the Letter Dated 22.10.2018 (Pages 110-112) Order of the Hon\u0026rsquo;ble High Court dated 28.11.2018 RTI dated 3.12.2018 to the DOT Legal Notice dated 3.12.2018 to the Government of Rajasthan Read our past work on shutdowns here and here  About us\n Work: The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) is an indian civil liberties organisation working on technology and fundamental rights.

As per news reports India’s telecom regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) likes to do it as well. It has started a process for setting its priorities for 2019 and is meeting telecom companies. We believe that such planning is good, and it can be better if they heard from internet users as well.\nYesterday, to put this request across formally we wrote a letter to the TRAI. We are asking them to invite a greater diversity of views beyond telecom companies in private meetings. This must include internet users.

As stated in a recent op-ed authored by Apar Gupta, Executive Director and Raman Chima, Trustee and Co-founder of IFF, published in the Hindustan Times, \u0026ldquo;The answer has been evasion as the central government till date has refused to provide any count or centralise a reporting and disclosure system. We should not fear such data, and that such calculation may put us to shame, for even existing news reports , India enjoys the top rank as the global leader in the number of Internet shutdowns.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is a matter of national shame. We are losing on our rights and India\u0026rsquo;s continued potential to lead the knowledge and skills economy which relies on reliable internet access. We have now started reaching out to parliamentarians on this issue.\nThis continues our working model of activism where our public engagement is towards institutional outcomes. A short recap. We have through the #KeepUsOnline campaign reached out to 15,000 individual and 80 institutional signatories who petitioned the government to condemn internet shutdowns. We then followed it up with a series of RTIs which demonstrate the legal rules for shutdowns were made secretly, and most recently supported a legal analysis of these rules by one of the domain experts in the area, Nakul Nayak.\nWe will continue working against internet shutdowns, meeting people, talking to them about them and ensuring India has a better rank in 2019. Do follow our updates.\nSo, what is IFF doing about it?\nNext stop is parliament and we are looking towards our legislators. The dates for the winter session have been announced which commences from December 11. We sensed there was a need to reach out to the offices of various legislators in advance. As subject area experts we are attempting to set up time, talk to their offices and explain this issue to them. Our hope through such knowledge sharing and to enable greater parliamentary engagement on Internet Shutdowns in India. To enable this, two volunteers (Arpitha and Hardik) authored a brief of this issue which is now being sent across alongwith meetings to put this issue across to several parliamentarians.\nClick here to download our brief on Internet Shutdowns\nHow can you help?\n Call on your lawmakers: We urge each person to reach out to their member of parliament and discuss this issue.

New Date for submissions is now 07.01.2019. Counter comments is 21.\nWe won right? Many of us know about Net Neutrality, a bit. Most of us would feel that fight for it is over and we won! Yes, we did. More than a million people sent emails to India’s telecom Regulator (TRAI) to stand up and protect their right to access internet content on their terms. Several regulations, recommendations and license amendments have followed. Substantial progress has been made over two years, but some core areas of work do remain. This includes a recurring policy proposal for the licensing of internet services and platforms (such as Whatsapp but also other chat, internet messaging and VOIP providers) which are called OTT services.\nTRAI\u0026rsquo;s OTT Consultation Paper While we do feel that this poses dangers to users, may prevent and bring a chokehold on innovation and overall just bad policy, we first want people to actually read the TRAI paper. The OTT Consultation Paper released by TRAI on November 12, 2018 runs into close to 42 pages (38 pages effectively) and to make the best use of your time and get you to read it, we made a 5 page summary (3 pages effectively). Click here to access the summary\nWhy a summary? Where is your analysis? This summary is without any opinion, commentary or analysis. It brings the core points of a larger document, condenses it, and puts it to you. We think this is an important first step in letting people form their opinions and search for answers by providing an authentic summary that you can trust. We intend to follow this up in a week with our analysis (like we always do), and then make a formal submission in the interest of users. In the paragraph below we further explain our model of civic engagement around government and regulatory processes to build capacity for public campaigns.\nWhat is IFF\u0026rsquo;s engagement model? Think about a summary as the first step in a three step process. We first hope over the coming months we are able to create summaries that come out within 24-48 hours of any regulatory consultation, policy or government measure. Then, the second step is that within a week post a comprehensive and reader friendly analysis on which we invite public comment, and then it is finally followed up with a participatory process for formal submissions. This may not be perfect to start out, there will be slips, but we hope to improve as we go along. For building out all of this, making sure we do not miss even one consultation — on net neutrality, free speech, privacy and innovation - we need to grow our capacity and hire people and organise the motivation and drive of volunteers. This starts with an email from you.\nKeep reaching out to us! If you have any thoughts or questions, notice a regulatory consultation on digital rights and want a summary, or want to help us draw up one, please feel free to reach out to us at volunteer@internetfreedom.in.

The landscape will now shift from rule-making to enforcement.\nHello, Internet freedom fighters, remember sending an email on net neutrality and saving the internet? While we won the policy debate, it took some time for the government to make legally binding rules. This post contains an analysis of the rules, our request to Government to plug loopholes which may undermine net neutrality and exploring citizen reporting models for complaining for any net neutrality violations. This a long post which may take about 6-8 minutes of your time, but then as all of us know net neutrality deserves a thorough and detailed analysis.\nThe good news We all have been fighting for net neutrality protections for more than two years. On September 26, 2018 the Department of Telecom (the government department which has licensed private companies to provide internet access) acting on recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (the regulatory body which has powers to make recommendations and in some instances make regulations) which has made license amendments prohibiting discrimination in treatment of content, or entering into any contract to do it.\nThis by itself, brings a firm legal prohibition that will prevent your internet service providers from speeding up, slowing down (any content-based discrimination) \u0026ndash; limiting your choice, bandwidth and ability to choose what you want to access on the internet. Yes, this is a significant victory for net neutrality, which has seen a rollback globally making India assert its leadership on this significant digital rights issue.\nIt is also significant to remember that the TRAI had in February, 2016, issued the Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016, by which it restricted the charging discriminatory prices to consumers based on the content. This price based discrimination would have allowed your service providers to charge you extra, or discount your access, to specific websites \u0026mdash; say either making access to Facebook free, but then charging over and above set your monthly bill and data limits for let\u0026rsquo;s say accessing Twitter. So, some may wonder, with the DOT license amendments plus the TRAI regulations on price discrimination, is the fight for net neutrality over in India? Not quite.\nThe not-so-good news Do not get us wrong. The TRAI and the DOT have to a large extent protected the interest of users on the issue of net neutrality. But we think there remain concerns which need to be addressed.\nThere are some concerns on the form and content on the amendments made by the Department of Telecom which we had earlier pointed out when TRAI had first made its recommendations. Since these recommendations have been carried through as license amendments as they were made, concerns remains especially on the ambiguity of certain definitions and the possibility of intellectual property related censorship. But our larger worry is now shifting from the landscape of rule-making to actual enforcement.\nWe recommend the following measures which need to be urgently taken up by the DOT:\n Further license amendments: Expand the scope of license amendments and extend it to all licenses. At present the DOT has made amendments in only two license categories [UL and UL(VNO)]. As recommended by the TRAI further amendments are necessary in three additional categories [ISP, UASL and CMTS]. This will strengthen net neutrality and bring consistency in the licensing regime. Internet of things: The present action by DOT is limited to license amendments which were recommended by the TRAI in Para 7.1, but were only a part of its recommendations. For instance its recommendations on IOT (Internet Of Things) as mentioned in Para 7.2 need to be followed through as well. Exemptions for CDNs: A clear exemption for CDN (Content Delivery Networks) needs to be crafted. The present language may restrict their availability. Specialised services: Process for prior permissions for, “specialised services” which will act as an exemption to the general rule of non-discrimination need to be set out. We urge that any such exemption should only be granted with full transparency, opportunity of public participation and a reasoned order. This will ensure that an exemption does not become a loophole used by internet service providers to circumvent net neutrality rules. Enforcement mechanism: The TRAI’s recommendations in Para 7.5 on the creation of a multi-stakeholder body, or any other process which makes it easy for common citizens and the public to make complaints for violations of net neutrality is missing at present. As cautioned by us before, such a body, should not be, “industry lead”, given that it would amount to the fox guarding the henhouse. Even otherwise such a body may over time exercise a gatekeeping role and prevent complaints being made for breaches and thereby act as a barrier rather than a facilitator.  On these follow up actions we have sent a letter to the DOT with a copy marked to the TRAI.\nWe recommend the following measures which need to be taken urgently by the TRAI:\n Transparency and disclosures: As the TRAI had itself noted, after the DOT would make its license amendments, the TRAI would bulk up its transparency and disclosure regulations to ensure compliance. We hope this is done urgently with prior public consultation. A clear enforcement mechanism: The TRAI can also assist and act as a body which receives public information and complaints on the breach of net neutrality rules. We need to move urgently on this given that it has taken already close to three years from the dates of the first consultation for net neutrality rules to be made in India. There are already disquieting voices from the cellular service providers that net neutrality rules should not extend to 5G services. Immediate enforcement actions are needed to prevent the net neutrality rules from becoming an academic exercise.  On these follow up actions we have sent a letter to the TRAI with a copy marked to the DOT.\nNow it all comes down to enforcement While we are thankful to both the DOT and the TRAI, a rule is often only as good as its enforcement. This will not only require subsequent action and penalties which build deterrence but also the interpretations are accorded in line with the intent of the license conditions and the regulations. We at IFF hope in the coming months to build out capacity to help people report any abuses of network neutrality regulations and support compliance.\nThis will need a process to be built out by regulators as indicated by TRAI\u0026rsquo;s net neutrality recommendations, however even with the new rules going into effect we can start bringing their attention to any breaches right now. For this we will need to establish both technically and legally any violations of net neutrality.\nReport Net Neutrality violations and volunteer If you have specific complaints and reports of violations, want to volunteer time, donate to help us hire dedicated staff and for reporting do write across to us at volunteer@internetfreedom.in\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/another-step-forward-in-indias-leadership-on-net-neutrality/","summary":"DOT makes important license amendments acting on TRAI recommendations.

We\u0026rsquo;ve done all this working early mornings, late nights, weekends and during lunch breaks, completely as volunteers.\nFrom October, we will do even more. Apar Gupta, one of our founding trustees, is joining IFF as its first executive director with a mission to build out the organisation.\nApar is a graduate of Amity Law School and Columbia University School of Law. During his tenure in law firms and in his independent law practice for the last four years, he worked on key digital rights litigations in India such as those concerning Section 66A, Intermediary Liability, Internet Shutdowns, the Right to Privacy judgement and the Aadhaar case. In coalitions with other activists, he helped create public campaigns to advance net neutrality, reform defamation laws, fight against internet shutdowns and introduce a strong privacy statute. We are excited to welcome him. Here is a short statement by Apar.\n“After litigating for over a decade, doing work that was deeply meaningful and instructive, I am transitioning to helping build a non-profit which has the promise of working on issues of technology to secure freedoms and our constitutional values of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. This becomes important as we participate in a social transformation that is digitally connecting a growing number of Indians. By focussing on public advocacy, creating a respectful and faithful relationship with our volunteers and community, using my experience and skills of approaching courts and regulators, I hope to help fulfil objectives of IFF’s mission. I recognise the challenges which are ahead of me, from organisation building - fundraising, growing resources and attracting top talent as staff, aiding our volunteers and supporters, remaining nimble and executing our work that causes positive impact \u0026ndash; to improving our public accountability, transparency and humility. I look forward to the work ahead and believe IFF is trying to do something special to protect the open internet in India.”\nWhile we look forward to the future, we also pause for reflection. We note that two or our trustees, Nikhil Pahwa and Kiran Jonnalagadda, have decided to leave the organisation to focus on new endeavours. We\u0026rsquo;re very thankful for their key role in creating IFF and supporting it for over two years. We all continue to share a common goal for digital rights in India, and look forward to collaborating again in future.\nIn the context of supreme court judgments on Privacy and Aadhaar, and on-the-ground technology deployments both by government and private entities, it is important for us to take stock of our achievements and failures and chart a way forward. We believe the following issues will be critical over the coming year:\n Freedom of Expression: There are rising incidents of censorship by various police departments abusing laws such as criminal defamation, sedition and even the unconstitutional Section 66A. We will work for comprehensive legal reforms to combat this. KeepUsOnline, our project against Internet shutdowns, will focus on getting greater transparency in shutdowns and blocking orders. We will also work on solutions to disinformation that do not involve weakening encryption or vague laws criminalising speech. Privacy, Encryption and Data Protection: SaveOurPrivacy, a community effort supported by us to defend and expand privacy protections in India, will continue and expand to cover Aadhaar. We\u0026rsquo;re wary of growing surveillance of online lives by both government and private actors, and that the government\u0026rsquo;s flawed data protection bill might be rushed through parliament without open deliberation. We stand ready to intervene using a mix of public awareness, legislative and litigation strategies. Electoral Integrity and Support for Digital Rights : The integrity of our electoral process is at risk from both well-funded online misinformation campaigns and censorship on the pretext of combating these campaigns. The increasing importance of the Internet in our lives is not reflected in the national political conversation. We aim to reach out to political parties and individual candidates to elicit pledges on digital rights. Net Neutrality: Our work is not done yet! The TRAI recommendations have still not been put into practice and binding law by the Government. We will continue to campaign for this process to be completed, and be vigilant to identify and highlight violations by ISPs.  In all our work, we hope to partner with other rights organisations to achieve shared objectives.\nThis is a very ambitious acceleration in the scope of our work, which is only possible by building an organisation with a talented and motivated staff, starting with Apar. We\u0026rsquo;re excited to welcome him as our executive director to help steer IFF through the next phase of our journey.\nAravind, Karthik, Rachita, Raman and Rohin, IFF Board of Trustees\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/looking-towards-the-future/","summary":"The Internet Freedom Foundation made its first public post on Independence Day, 2016 with the ideal of building an organisation that is an effective advocate for digital rights in India.

Justice B.N. Srikrishna submitted its 176 page report to the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology at 1600 Hrs on 27 July 2018 (today). The Committee also submitted a draft of the legislation on data protection titled, ‘The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018’. After weeks of secrecy, denial of information in RTIs about the proceedings of the Committee, the report as well as the draft legislation have now been placed in public domain. It is a welcome step to see a comprehensive data protection and privacy framework finally publicly proposed for India - home to over 1/5th of the world’s population and the second largest internet user base.\nIn August last year, a month after the constitution of this ten-membered committee, the Supreme Court had delivered its landmark Puttaswamy judgment interpreting the right to privacy as a fundamental right. The judgment was expected to work as the guiding principle of the experts’ committee. It is our hope that the bill provides a substantive manifestation of the fundamental right to privacy and plugs the hole in Indian legal framework where no effective data protections rights, regulation, and remedy exist.\nNow that the report and the Bill have been submitted to the Ministry, it will consider the bill, perhaps make amendments and then may choose to bring the bill to Parliament - for enactment. It remains to be seen whether the Ministry places the Bill in the on-going Monsoon session of Parliament or not. The onus now lies on the Union executive and eventually the Parliament of India to provide our nation a comprehensive data protection and privacy framework. Having said that, it is important that a thorough and transparent public consultation is now undertaken on the Draft Bill before it is passed by Parliament. The Government is mandated to do so under its own Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy of 2014.\nWhile the development of a data protection framework in India is encouraging, many gaps reveal themselves in the current documents submitted by this government committee:\n Many exceptions for processing of data by the government can be seen. This seems to dilute the rights of the citizens with respect to their data vis a vis the the State. There is a dire need for surveillance law reform in India. It was our hope that this effort would provide a comprehensive framework overhauling surveillance and interception in India - in consonance with the international standards on necessary and proportionate principles, along with providing proper judicial scrutiny. However, the report and bill does not seem to provide substantive changes in the surveillance regime in India. As noted in an official dissent by certain members of the committee, Rishikesha T. Krishnan and Rama Vedashree, the provisions for keeping a copy of all data in India is concerning. This move towards data localisation takes away from the open character of our global internet and is disproportionate to the benefits (if any) it would achieve.  We would like to point out that there have been previous attempts at proposing laws for protection of data and privacy, including expert recommendations like the Report of Group of experts on Privacy under Justice AP Shah and the draft bill prepared internally within the Union Government across 2011-2015. There have also been attempts in the past to reform our intelligence agencies with respect to their surveillance and interception functions, as well as place them under some form of legal oversight. But it isn’t clear how much of these past attempts have informed the proceedings of the current Committee and its recommendations. We are in the process of going through the bill and the report in a much more comprehensive manner. We shall be providing a detailed take on the bill as well as an evaluation of the bill when compared to the seven privacy principles proposed in the Indian Privacy Code, 2018.\nThis is an important day for the nation - in its move towards securing the rights of its citizens. The report is not the end of the process, but instead marks the beginning of the development of a comprehensive data protection and privacy regulation in India. We hope to continue engaging with the government and our elected lawmakers, and continue the struggle to #SaveOurPrivacy. A strong privacy and data protection law must come into force before our next general election - this is a critical step to protect our increasingly digital democracy.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/saveourprivacy-initial-statement-on-justice-srikrishna-committee-report/","summary":"Originally posted on SaveOurPrivacy.in\nThe Expert Committee chaired by Retd.

The response dismissed our petition and call for reforms stating, “the other additional issues raised in your reference, such as, increasing number of internet shutdowns, procedures not being followed by State Governments, public inconvenience due to such shutdowns, etc. had already been duly considered while formulating the rules referred above and the consensus is that Security and Safety of the Citizens and the State are paramount and cannot be compromised in any circumstances”.\nWe are disappointed with this outcome and will keep pressing these demands.

Srikrishna Committee on its call for comments on a white paper.\nGiven the concerns which have been repeatedly made on the composition, lack of diversity and transparency of this committee, as well as a larger lack of pace over the years on a privacy law we felt it was necessary to support a civil society project to build awareness on privacy and data protection in India. To start this process we sent an email to Justice B.N. Srikrishna Committee with a copy of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 and seven core principles.\n###Main features of #SaveOurPrivacy The main features and goals of the SaveOurPrivacy website are explained below:\n  Call to action: SaveOurPrivacy has a simple call to action. It relies on public voices to put forward a demand to the Government to introduce a user right focussed data protection law in parliament hopefully in the monsoon session of parliament. This legal text should match the 7 privacy principles and the ideas behind the Indian Privacy Code, 2018.\n  Public awareness: SaveOurPrivacy will rely on a series of summaries on what a privacy and data protection law should contain in addition to a summary of seven core principles which should be at the heart of a data protection law. It will also explore holding roundtables and hearings in different cities as it believes the public is the principal stakeholder in the formation of a data protection law. The campaign will reach out to popular voices to broad base the issue and spur civic participation.\n  Transparency: The website seeks to invite not only endorsements but substantive comments on the Indian Privacy Code through an online tool that permits line by line, word by word annotations. This is to facilitate greater public and expert participation. The comments received will be published and all changes will be considered.\n  Collaboration: The model of SaveOurPrivacy facilitates organisational sign-ups and endorsements to the seven core principles and this is an effort to facilitate a draft law based on protecting the individual and her fundamental right to privacy. In addition to the online tools, pro-active outreach through in-person meetings and roundtables is intended. IFF is playing the supporting role of a facilitator to what we hope will be diverse voices of leadership on data protection and privacy.\n  We believe the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 even though a model draft that will change and become better in time, puts through a comprehensive statute, a user right focussed data protection law. This is a policy fix for the recurring concerns and controversies including issues such as Aadhaar, Cambridge Analytica, the Social Media Communication Hub and the Snowden revelations on mass surveillance. We believe that a data protection law that protects people should consider preventing any dilution to the right to information, reform state surveillance and interception of our communications, most importantly prevent the denial of legal entitlements and subsidies caused due to weak user rights.\nAs our world becomes more connected and digital, our personal data has immense power over us, it is time to give that power back to the people of India.

We impress upon people to spend time reading it as many of these are not even inferences, but functionality desired as per express statements in the tender document.\n###Violative of Privacy and Freedom of Speech These functions give rise to an array of legal harms, constitutional, legal - for privacy and the freedom of speech and expression. The Social Media Communication Hub will create a surveillance society and have a chilling effect on internet users across India.\nApar Gupta, co-founder and volunteer at IFF, said, “In China, a Social Credit Scheme builds off capacity for mass surveillance and uses big data analysis. It relies on detailed profiles of all its residents which are aggregated, analysed and stored on multiple data points. It is not out of place to remember that China also heavily censors its internet. Reading the tender document one feels it comes from a heavy inspiration of the Chinese model. Thankfully we have constitutional text and culture to protect us. Specifically, the Social Media Communication Hub is contrary to our fundamental rights to privacy and free expression. It is an insult to the nine-judge bench judgement that unanimously reaffirmed our fundamental right to privacy. We hope that the tender is recalled and cancelled failing which the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting will imperil the aspiration of a digital India, converting it into a digital panopticon.”\nIFF reiterates its commitment to fight for privacy and free expression online. Failing positive action by the government to rescind and cancel this tender we will take all steps available under law.\nLink to our correspondence:\n Our notice dated May 30, 2018 PDF or GoogleDocs  About us\nInternet Freedom Foundation (IFF) is a non-profit organisation that supports and advocates for a free and open Internet.

The new rules reinforce and provide a legal basis to shutting down the internet for vague reasons, without transparency and little oversight. A recent press report found even these rules are not being properly enforced when it noted, “In the past fortnight, six states have used internet shutdowns to control law and order crises. They are West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. But of these, only two states – Madhya Pradesh and Punjab – followed the procedure laid down in rules notified by the Centre in 2017.” (Scroll.in, India’s Internet Shutdown: Most States block services without following new rules [April 7, 2018]).\nApar Gupta, co-founder, IFF said, “In 2016, India shutdown the internet more than any other country. This is a shameful statistic. It sets back the goals of a vibrant digital India and our fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. It flies in the face of not only rights but logic given it is counterproductive to any public policy goal such as maintaining and restoring normalcy when there is a breach of law and order. For instance the internet is used by people when there are physical curfews to tell their loved ones and pass messages for safety. It impacts businesses causing thousands of crores of losses. It impacts government services for instance lawyers cannot access court websites and plan and prepare for the cases listed the next day. Even with the new rules, which require a thorough review, transparency remains a problem. There is no central database or disclosure on the number of internet shutdowns and we have been reduced to rely on underreported and faulty data sets based on episodic media stories.

By taking a decisive stand on upholding Net Neutrality, TRAI has built upon the strong foundation it had laid down in 2016 by issuing regulations prohibiting Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services.\nWe welcome these recommendations for the following reasons:\nRecognition of the principle of non-discrimination: The TRAI has recommended license changes to expressly prohibit discriminatory treatment of content. This recommendation goes a long way in preserving the open internet. We are particularly supportive of the broad framing of, “discrimination” which would include, restrictions, interference, blocking, degrading, slowing down, or granting preferential speeds or treatment.\nLimited exceptions: To the broad rule of non-discrimination, the TRAI has recommended limited exceptions which represent a positive recognition of net neutrality principles. For instance the TRAI has - despite lobbying pressure - refused to carve out a special exemption for, “Internet of Things” (IOT) services and devices unless they are specifically identified to be servicing critical services. Similarly a requirement of a trio of proportionality, transiency and transparency bring a higher sense of rationality and reasonableness to any traffic management services that are to be implemented by telecom companies.\nTransparency and accountability mechanism: We are especially glad that the principle of non-discrimination will be safeguarded by a mix of a transparency and an accountability mechanism. This will ensure that the intent of these recommendations once made into binding rules is complied with and any violations are penalised.\nThere are some concerns we continue to have and will keep monitoring the implementation of these recommendations, specifically:\nFuture consultation on OTT Services: The TRAI has indicated in a covering letter containing the Net Neutrality recommendations it’s intention to hold a separate consultation to, “regulate” OTT Services. While we are concerned and continue to look forward to a comprehensive data protection regime, any intent to mandate heavy handed licensing or registrations for internet applications are services will undermine the open internet. Since SaveTheInternet.in’s first submission we have warned against creating that bureaucratic red tape, as well as any poorly reasoned attempt to license internet applications and service will prevent innovation on the open internet and restrict user choice.\nLack of precise definitions and ambiguity: While the overall scope of TRAI’s recommendations is positive some finer details lack proper definition or are framed in a manner which has the potential for abuse. For instance, the exception to the non-discrimination principle which is available to, “specialised services” is open to abuse given that the criteria to qualify as one is fairly broad. Further we are also concerned that the suggested formation of the multi-stakeholder body is suggested to be, “industry lead”, which on the contrary should be built on principles of balance and diversity.\nPossibility of intellectual property related censorship: From the perspective of ensuring freedom of speech and expression online and to prevent overbroad takedowns we are concerned with the recommendation that discrimination may be permitted to comply with international treaty obligations. Such obligations, without court orders, underlying legislation can potentially open up requests for blocking content online on grounds of intellectual property compliance.\nThe TRAI recommendations are another recognition of India taking the lead on Net Neutrality worldwide and we hope that this is soon followed up with action from the Department of Telecom.\nWe call on for the following actions:\n  A public statement from the Hon’ble Minister of Telecommunications endorsing the recommendations of the TRAI;\n  An indication by the Department of Telecom on timelines for implementation of the recommendations of the TRAI;\n  A publication of draft rules and license amendments by the Department of Telecom to ensure that the recommendations of the TRAI. This is to ensure that the recommendations are followed in spirit and also to address concerns on the limited concerns highlighted above that may undermine net neutrality.\n  We continue to maintain the TRAI can in the interim exercise its powers under provisions of the provisions to maintain quality of service make rules to safeguard its recommendations on net neutrality.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/trais-recommendations-are-another-big-victory-for-net-neutrality-but-follow-up-action-is-needed/","summary":"IFF notes with appreciation the recommendations issued by Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Net Neutrality despite push back from some quarters of the telecommunication industry against any additional regulations.

What brought us together was a shared passion for protecting the open internet and the digital rights of users. We strongly felt that this couldn\u0026rsquo;t be done without protecting the privacy of individuals. Our very fundamental notions and protections of privacy and data protection are today under challenge by Aadhaar, and we are taking the following steps to protect it.\nWhat is the problem with Aadhaar? Aadhaar is the government of India’s mandatory, biometric identification system. It uses a centralised repository to maintain digital identities and their authentication records. This is open for use not only by government but also private companies. As a centralised system with a shared identifier, it enables mass surveillance that breaks data silos and increases the profiling of individuals. The technology implemented to build Aadhaar is not only demonstrably faulty, it has evaded any public scrutiny or transparency as to its security and reliability. We are gravely concerned with its architectural design, and with implementation flaws.\nThe Aadhaar program has undermined the fundamental right to privacy and left us without safeguards. There is absolutely no recognition of consent as the use of Aadhaar is mandatory, which violates the very premise of any data protection law. Further, centralisation and the lack of data minimisation principles has made us all vulnerable to be profiled from the cradle to the grave. This continues in the face of legal challenges before the Supreme Court, and in the absence of any meaningful data protection law.\nWhat is IFF planning to do? While our work remains limited to privacy and data protection, there have been citizen groups who have been working on Aadhaar for a long time. They come from diverse streams of work. Some agitate against the system on grounds of the right to information, some on exclusion from rations, subsidies and pensions, and others on grounds of national security. As the Aadhaar program grows in scale, so does the opposition against it.\nWe offer our support to these groups, making available our tools, techniques and time. IFF also recognises that far more work on privacy is needed, and will seek avenues to complement existing efforts. There will be further updates.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/aadhaar-undermines-informational-privacy-and-data-protection/","summary":"When the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) was launched more than a year ago, we had a spirited conversation on taking forward our work from SaveTheInternet.in and net neutrality.

We previously posted a short summary of this consultation paper back in September.\nYou can read our full November 6 comments to the TRAI here.\nWe request the TRAI to protect user privacy and data protection in the telecom sector in the following way:\n  A comprehensive rights based data protection statute: Data protection is about protecting the privacy of users by advancing their rights vis-a-vis their data. We request the TRAI to not go beyond the powers under the TRAI Act and the Telegraph Act. Any measures that the TRAI proposes should be a stop-gap arrangement targeting data collected by telecom service providers till a comprehensive privacy and data protection act is passed by Parliament.\n  A rule of law framework: We are troubled by the framing of the consultation paper which seeks to advocate that a “technology framework… will enable the regulator pro-actively monitor the system, as well as bring in advanced techniques for fraud detection”. This seems to suggest a technical framework that undermines consent, purpose limitations and accountability (consent is one of the primary principles of data protection).\n  Big data is personal data: The focus to fork out, “big data”, from the definition of “personal data” will undermine citizen rights. Aggregated data sets which are based on individual information have tremendous data protection implications.\n  Read our detailed submissions.\nWe have specifically suggested three steps the TRAI must take:\n  Consistently advance a position based off the foundation of privacy being a fundamental right of all Indian citizens and goes beyond “ownership”.\n  Protect telecom users against mass surveillance which is illegal and unconstitutional by starting a public consultation.\n  Share public consultation practices with the Justice Srikrishna Committee on Data Protection.\n  Want to become an Internet Freedom Fighter?\nIFF promises to keep advocating for your Internet freedoms—freedom of speech, privacy, net neutrality and freedom to innovate, inside and outside court.

The Internet Freedom Foundation is releasing a copy of these recommendations to public and calling for a consultation.\nStruck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 was the unconstitutional tool used to curb free speech on social media. The Section had been used to arrest a number of internet users voicing their political opinions on social media, like in the famous case of Facebook user Shaheen Dhada being arrested for posting her thoughts on the death of politician Bal Thackeray.\nIn 2015, the Supreme Court by its decision in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, struck Section 66A down as being vague and unconditional. Given the public interest in this issue we have been able to access the government recommendations for the new Section 66A and are releasing it today.\nLack of transparency around process used to formulate a new Section 66A Our first concern remains the opaque process through which the T.K. Vishwanathan Committee (Section 66A committee) functioned. This committee did not invite any inputs or any public comment, and to our knowledge did not have any members of civil society. This is illustrative of a wider landscape in which technology policy in India is being determined without involving public policy, tech experts or civil society organisations. Even the recommendations of the Section 66A committee were not made public till now. We urge government to stand by the robust tradition of public consultation as was observed by TRAI in its net neutrality consultation.\nStifling freedom of expression and fundamental rights of internet users Much more substantively the recommendations of the committee do not fully consider the import of the landmark Shreya Singhal judgement and seem to extend hate speech provisions which are by themselves susceptible to abuse. The law of hate speech in India has seen problematic application where it has often been abused and applied to artists, writers and journalists. Expanding such a law without building in sufficient safeguards is likely to result in greater abuse.\nParticularly the proposal to insert Section 505A is a cause for worry as it reads a lot like Section 66A. Even though the Section 66A committee has limited the application of the provision by inserting conditions under which it can be used, such conditions are of little benefit given that undefined phrases such as, “highly disparaging” and “grossly offensive” still exist. Since these phrases do not contain any legislative guidance in any law they will be susceptible to abuse.\nWhat’s next for internet users IFF urges the government to recognise the democratic underpinnings of internet communications which have provided masses an ability to speak and receive information at an unprecedented scale. Any restrictions even if socially desirable should be through an open, transparent, public consultation.

The Section had been used to arrest a number of internet users voicing their political opinions on social media, like in the famous case of Facebook user Shaheen Dhada being arrested for posting her thoughts on the death of politician Bal Thackeray.","title":"Urgent Release: Government Committee wants to bring back Section 66A"},{"content":"Chapter I – Introduction and Background The evolution of telecommunications services in the recent times has been of great advantage by aiding the overall economic and social development of the country, enabling better connectivity among users and emergence of a variety of new business models and increasing the use of information and communication technology services (ICT) services. Moreover, the user’s interaction with the modern ICT services through any form of content lately has increased the quantity and value of data that is being generated in large amounts. This leap in the generation of data to 9 times the earlier amount in the last two years has enabled (i) businesses/agencies to monetise their products/services and gain a competitive edge over others, (ii) government agencies to efficiently deliver services and prevent/handle crimes, by the use of tools like data collection, storage and analytics. (para 1.1 to 1.2)\nWhile recognizing the benefits and potential of data analytics, the rights of individuals in association with data protection i.e. the ability of individuals to understand/control the access/use of their information by others, also needs to be given due importance specifically the issue of informational privacy. In this context, establishing the ownership of the data is imperative which also brings in the dimension of empowerment to the user. (para 1.3 to 1.4)\nThe rationale for govt. intervention is to prevent harm to consumers in this sphere arises on account of: (i) issue of under-estimation by consumers about (a) the long term consequences of their actions while consenting to share their personal information to avail benefits (bounded rationality), (b) the value of their personal data and ignorance about the scale and use of their data collected by data users (information asymmetry), and (ii) issue of service providers generating, holding data and using it to get into adjacencies (data monopoly). (para 1.4)\nThe govt./authorized agencies should enable the growth of the industry either by creation of newer services. This could either be done by extracting all user data from a service and sharing it with another (data portability) or by creating anonymized public data sets to be used as test bed by newer service providers, thus (i) enabling the creation of innovative services by new players and (ii) ensuring a level playing field, which ultimately provide significant value to customers/businesses. In essence, this consultation paper aims to identify the key issues pertaining to data protection in relation to the delivery of digital services. (para 1.5 to 1.6)\nChapter II – Data Protection Data protection - legal control over access to, use of data, stored in digital format - process of safeguarding digital information from corruption/loss.\nKey principles\nA report of planning commission (Group of experts headed by J. A.P. Shah) on data privacy recommended formulation of sector and technology neutral bill by adoption of national level privacy principles: i) Notice, Choice and Consent: DC shall give simple notice about what personal information is being collected, its purpose and use, disclosure to 3rd party, notification in case of breach to all users/individuals and shall give opt-in/opt-out choice to individuals in regards to providing their personal information, take consent after such notice. ii) Collection, purpose limitation: DC shall collect information necessary for purposes identified and the data collected, processed should be adequate/relevant to the purpose. iii) Access and correction: Individuals to have access to their information with DCs and be able to seek correction, amendment, deletion, if inaccurate. iv) Disclosure of information and Security: Only disclose information to 3rd party after notice to and seeking consent of individual and to secure information using reasonable security safeguards. v) Openness and Accountability: DC shall take steps to implement practices, procedures, policies, systems proportional to scale, scope, sensitivity to data collected to ensure compliance with privacy principles and make this information available to individuals and shall also be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to privacy principles. (para 2.2) [*Data controller (DC) - any organisation that determines purposes/means of processing user’s personal information]\nThese principles can be considered a starting point to examine the soundness of the current framework that governs data protection in the current digital ecosystem. Whereas it is also imperative to consider the challenges relating to aspects of high variety, velocity, volume of data and issues like accessibility, accuracy, reliability of data, harmonization of standards that arise in the context of data with increase in use. (para 2.3)\nTelecommunications and data protection\nIn order to protect the privacy of users of telecom services, it is important to ascertain aspects like ownership rights, authority to use,transact,delete personal data which is currently ambiguous and ensure TSPs and data controllers involved are bound to follow certain safeguards while collecting,storing,using data of subscribers which they gain access while delivering their services. Moreover, the report of the planning commission after a review of the current telecom regulatory framework upheld the privacy principles enumerated above and also noted both the elements already in place and elements missing in the framework. (para 2.4 to 2.5)\nTelecom sector-specific requirements (An overview of the current framework)\nTSP’s bound by no. of requirements that flow from sector specific laws and conditions and general provisions as per Information Technology Act, 2000 relating to data protection. a) India Telegraph Act, 1885 puts a general obligation on telecommunication service providers (TSPs) to prevent unauthorized interception of messages and maintain secrecy. (Sections 24, 25, 26, 30 and Rules) b) Unified license agreement contains requirements relating to data protection. (Clause 37, 39.12) c) Initiatives taken by TRAI – Directive to all TSPs ensuring compliance of terms and conditions of license in regards to confidentiality of information of subscribers and privacy of communications. d) IT Act contains provisions for TSPs/intermediaries relating to data protection and interception of information by authorized agencies. The grounds of interception under the IT Act has a wider scope on comparison to Telegraph Act. (Section 43A, 72A and Rules) (para 2.6)\nSecurity of the telecommunications network\nIt is imperative to safeguard the telecom infrastructure through adequate security measures from potential vulnerabilities and to preserve data confidentiality. Also, this sector is a key pillar of critical national infrastructure and requires security as vulnerabilities lead to disruption of basic services, severely impacts citizens and businesses and delivery of public services. Confidence in the network and services offered to customers/subscribers, public authorities demand to ensure availability of services, fair competition, privacy protection, security to safeguard operation and business interests of network/service providers and meet obligations mark the requirements of network security framework. Also, Section 70 of IT Act declares certain areas as critical information infrastructure (CII). (para 2.7 to 2.8)\nChapter III - Stakeholders: Digital Eco System The privacy concerns that relate to services provided by TSPs also emanate from the activities of variety of other stakeholders like content/application service providers, device manufacturers, browsers, operating systems etc. that process/control the personal data of users.\nWays in which data of users can be accessed and controlled by these stakeholders: i) Cookies and fingerprinting – Cookies allow a website to identify a user’s device and can be of various types such as session, persistent, first party and third party cookies. However, the general users have low awareness about the use, beneficial and harmful objectives of deploying cookies. Device fingerprinting uses various information elements transmitted by a device in order to identify it which is used as an alternative for cookies to track internet behavior over time. ii) Permission taken by applications – Software applications pose data protection concerns by allowing the app owners/stores, operating systems, device manufacturers and analytics/ advertising providers to collect vast amount of data of the user from their device and process it for business purposes. Apps also collect information about others people through consenting customers as the users allowing access don’t understand the implications of granting consent and sometimes they do not have an effective choice due to the uneven bargaining power of the provider. Further, the lack of security mechanisms in these apps, like a malware attack on vulnerable apps also pose a concern. iii) Generally, operating systems as intermediaries set rules in terms of permissions sought by apps, provide disclosures and transparent to users in regards to privacy controls. But there is also a need to consider appropriate mechanisms for the timely detection and reporting of any threats as the use of proprietary codes and systems contributes to an increase in the vulnerabilities of certain types of systems. iv) The growth in adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices also raises concern about the nature and extent of data collected by devices, the purpose for which it can be used and security of these devices as devices and equipments used by individuals to connect to various networks gather large volumes of data about user’s behaviour. (para 3.1)\nThe issues above to an extent are catered to by the provisions of IT Act but a more comprehensive privacy and data protection law for the country still needs to be formulated to address issues of identifying the categories of data that needs protection, the stakeholders that would be bound by requirements of data protection and the obligations to be cast on them and mechanism for proper enforcement of these obligations. Moreover, the scope of personal data keeping in mind changes in technology and methods of aggregation needs to be broadened as data protection regulations have always been focused on personal data as it is attributable to individuals which has an ability to generate greater harm. (para 3.2 to 3.3)\nEssential elements for a data protection framework\nIt will be useful to build a technology framework which monitors the uses of data and its compliance with regulations as the growth in use of data also requires the regulations to cope with the volume and diversity of usage. An appropriate safety and security mechanism to preserve the infrastructure and systems of providers is also required because data breaches not only expose personal information but also have financial and reputational consequences. The stakeholders involved also need to improve awareness and understanding of consumers in regards to use and protection of data. Also, the issues of cross-border transfer of data and exercise of jurisdiction over service provider which currently is absent in the country are becoming relevant. All these issues needs to be addressed in a manner that balances the requirements of business innovation, efficiency and security to ensure an effective solution on data protection. (para 3.4 to 3.7)\nChapter 4 - Data Protection Framework in other countries European Union\nThe Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePrivacy Directive) sets out rules for providers of traditional electronic communication services to manage subscriber’s data. It also lays down directives in regards to confidentiality of electronic communications, security obligations, confidentiality of terminal equipment, processing of traffic and location data etc. A regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications has been proposed to update current rules to adapt to technical developments and the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework adopted to ensure confidentiality of electronic communications regardless of technology used.\nGDPR - protects personal data, applies to all sectors, requires consent of data subject, provides data breach notifications, requires privacy by design, conditions applicable to transfer of data across borders. It does cover business-to-business communication/communication between individuals which does not include personal data.(para 4.1 to 4.3)\nUnited States\nThe Federal Trade Commission implements the federal consumer protection law that prohibits unfair/deceptive practices and applies to offline, online privacy and data security policies. Further, the Federal Communications Commission enacted broadband privacy rules aimed at greater choice, transparency and security protections for personal data. (para 4.4 to 4.6)\nChapter 5 - Issues of Consultation Questions posed to stakeholders to obtain views on next steps for a comprehensive consultation on data protection in telecom sector and other areas of digital ecosystem. Answers/comments to issues should be supported with justification. They can also comment on other issues related to data privacy and security in telecom sector with details.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/summary-of-the-consultation-paper-on-privacy-security-and-ownership-of-the-data/","summary":"Chapter I – Introduction and Background The evolution of telecommunications services in the recent times has been of great advantage by aiding the overall economic and social development of the country, enabling better connectivity among users and emergence of a variety of new business models and increasing the use of information and communication technology services (ICT) services.

This includes a tweet from the news wire service ANI and parody/gossip handles such as @LutyensMasala and @LutyensSpice. These blocking orders call for urgent focus on the problematic process and legality of website blocking in India.\nWhat do the letters say? The letters which have been issued under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 [“Blocking Rules, 2009”].\n  The letter issued on August 16, 2017 (available here) is accompanied with a list of URLs and hashtags running into 133 entries (available here). The letter issued on August 16, 2017 is premised on earlier requests for blocking and states that, “it came to the notice of this Ministry that certain URLs which were ordered for blocking in the aforesaid meeting are still accessible”. There is no aforesaid date for meeting, with the only relevant reference being, “several occasions”.\n  The letter issued on August 24, 2017 (available here) is accompanied with a list of URLs running into 115 entries (available here), it states the order has been issued due to information, “received from law enforcement agency” that tweets/handles are, “propagating objectionable contents”. It then directs them to “block/remove” the 115 entries, “in the interest of the public order as well as for preventing any cognizable offence”.\n  What’s the problem? There letters are vague and illegal even of the few safeguards which are contained under law.\n  No notice or hearing: These blocking orders do not record whether any opportunity was provided to Twitter’s users prior to passing this order. This is required not only by Rule 8(1) of the Blocking Rules, 2009, but also by the constitutional norms which require the government to provide an opportunity of hearing.\n  Absence of reasons: While on the face of it both the letters dated August 16 and 24 contain reasons for the blocking, they are not explanatory, and are what are termed in the law as “non-speaking orders”. The reasons, beyond merely hinting at “public order”, lack any specificity. They fail to reason what the illegality is, and under which substantive provision of law the illegality is. Finally, they bunch together a large laundry list, without specifying on what reasons these individual tweets, twitter handles and trends were blocked.\n  Overbroad, pre-censorship: We are also concerned that the blocking of Twitter accounts and hashtag trends is broad pre-censorship. Twitter accounts and especially hashtag trends may not be illegal in themselves, as compared to individual tweets. Such censorship is incredibly worrying and reminiscent of the “keyword based censorship” as practiced in China. This may set a grave precedent in which certain words and phrases are scrubbed off search engines, and off our online vocabularies.\n  Lack of transparency: The Blocking Rules contains problematic language which has been cited in the past by government to prevent disclosure of blocking orders. Though the present letters have been made available on Lumen, this is a departure from regular practice which lacks transparency. We urge the government to publish all blocking orders.\n  The blocking of any content impacts not only the speakers of the content, but also the fundamental right of persons to receive information.\nWe unequivocally urge the Indian Government to recall the blocking orders issued particularly through its letters dated August 16 and August 24. We further call on the Government to open a public consultation to reform the blocking power and process, particularly the Blocking Rules.

This case arises from a challenge to the change in WhatsApp’s privacy policy, after which it began sharing data with Facebook.\nThrough the WhatsApp case, we hope to carry forward our promise that the landmark nine-judge-bench ruling upholding privacy as a fundamental right is just the beginning. Yesterday, we pressed for interim reliefs to restrict WhatsApp from sharing your data.\nRead more to find out the latest developments.\nArguments by the parties At the start of arguments, the Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Government referred to an office memorandum by which a committee of experts had been formed to deliberate on a data protection framework. IFF has grave concerns on the composition of this committee. However, is not making any substantive comment at this time. The ASG submitted that the Government will soon bring in a legislation to protect data protection, which will cover concerns as have arisen in the WhatsApp case. This was strongly supported by senior counsel appearing for WhatsApp, Facebook India and Facebook, Inc.\nIn response to this, Ms. Madhavi Divan, advocate for the Petitioner, submitted that there were important constitutional determinations which are applicable irrespective of a future or an existing data protection legislation. Representing IFF, Senior Counsel Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan supported this stand and submitted that the recent nine judge bench Privacy Judgement directly considered the constitutional interaction between privacy and metadata. Given such arguments were likely to take time and would not have concluded yesterday, we pressed for interim reliefs.\nInterim Reliefs “Interim reliefs” are essentially safeguards that a court can grant till the case is finally heard and disposed off. Hence, till the time the Court decides the larger legality, users should not be put at risk with respect to their personal data. We sought to limit the sharing of data, on which the Hon’ble Court directed the filing of affidavits by WhatsApp and Facebook to state their data sharing practices (which may include details such as, what data is shared, how it is shared, with whom it is shared, and how it is processed), after which it will consider the passing of an interim order.\nWe are thankful to our legal team which consists of Vrinda Bhandari, N. Sai Vinod, Ravi Raghunathan and Mukunda Rao, who assist Mr. K.V. Viswanath, Senior Advocate, and appear pro-bono to support the digital rights of internet users in India.\nThe case has now been fixed for hearing on 20.11.2017.

Titled the “Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017” and issued by the Centre under Section 7 of the Indian Telegraph Act, they were quietly published in the Gazette of India earlier this month on August 7. Quite simply, they provide a legal mechanism under which the internet can be turned off. This is a change from the earlier situation when there was no clear legal power for the regular internet shutdowns taking place across states in India.\nWhile this may seem like a positive development, we still think it falls short of meaningful reform this country deserves. We have concerns both on how these rules were made, and also what they say and how they may be enforced; we provide our initial views in this post:\n###How were these rules made ? We do not know. There was no public consultation or even a panel of independent experts who got a chance to look at them.\nWe are immediately concerned with the process through which these rules were made as there was no public consultation, no opportunity for academics, engineers, experts and research organisations to comment on any draft. Though required under the terms of the Telegraph Act and Indian parliamentary procedure, these telecom service suspension rules have not yet been tabled before the houses of Parliament. A closed process for drafting without involving a multi stakeholder process, or inviting stakeholder comment often results in solutions that are ineffective or which fail to survive judicial scrutiny. Greater diversity brings the benefit of wider input and deliberation resulting in positive, public interest friendly policy fixes. One example of this is the TRAI model and the net neutrality consultations in which many made their voice heard.\nWe request the government to put these rules and its policy position on the issue of internet shutdowns and telecom service suspension through a consultation process and openly engage with citizens.\n###What do these rules say ? Why should we be concerned. Even though the rules provide - some - clarity, they still remain vague and problematic.\nThe rules create an administrative structure at the level of central and state governments to issue legal orders for shutting down the internet, and review committees to oversee this at both levels. But there is a lot the rules do not say and there is an absence of safeguards that we think are necessary. For instance the rules do not contain any limitation on the grounds under which the shutdown order can be issued or the period for which it will be in force. This will allow government officials to shut down access to the internet on flimsy pretexts such as preventing people from cheating in exams through mobile resources. This is has happened before and gives us concern that this power may be used indiscriminately.\nWe are also concerned that these rules lack transparency and pro-active disclosure of government measures on shutting down telecom services, including the internet. Though we believe that there should be proactive publication of all orders issued under these rules, there is no specific provision within them that mandates concerned government officials to explicitly do so.\nWe have many other concerns on substance with the rules and will continue to study them. It is our belief that they do not follow the international norms of necessity and proportionality, and the ever increasing view that blanket internet shutdowns and blocking of entire websites is not compatible with fundamental rights.\n###How will they be enforced?\nIt is important to note that these rules did not come out today or yesterday. They seem to have been quietly published on August 7, 2017 without any Ministerial statement. During this period wide ranging internet shutdowns have been enforced in various parts of the country. These include a rolling data blackout in Darjeeling which has not had internet access for more than 70 days, in the State of Haryana which also includes parts of North India’s IT Hub Gurgaon, and every other day in Kashmir and Manipur.\nClearly things have not become better since these rules were made. Though we do acknowledge the Government trying to address this policy gap through law, we disagree with the solution. We fear these rules are insufficient and poorly designed.\nIFF supporters may recall our Keep Us Online petition which gathered around eighteen thousand signatures and had more than 100 organisations sign on. Our principal ask in our petition to the Office of the Hon’ble Prime Minister to start a consultation process on the issue of internet shutdowns. We call on his office to take steps to fulfil it.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/the-union-government-taking-clear-action-to-prevent-internet-shutdowns-no-not-really/","summary":"Press reports have revealed that the Union Government’s Department of Telecom has issued rules on governing network disruptions or internet shutdowns in India.

For those who are looking for more background on the case one of our earlier posts which is available here contains a neat summary.\nWhile online privacy is important for the welfare of internet users if this is imposed through licensing requirements it will kill innovation. This is a hard balance to strike as India at present does not have a privacy law and one of the easier solutions is by making online platforms register and license like telecom companies. But online platforms are not telecom companies.

Add your signature to it.\n To: Shri Narendra Modi The Hon’ble Prime Minister\u0026rsquo;s Office South Block, Raisina Hill New Delhi - 110011\nDear Prime Minister,\nWe are signing this petition asking you to — keep us online!\nIndia had more Internet shutdowns in 2016 than any other country. Recent research estimated this caused us a loss of more than Rs. 6000 crores. A disruption to the internet is a disruption to everyday life. Research from the Centre for Communications Governance and the Digital Empowerment Foundation show that this is a growing trend - in total numbers and across states in India.\nState governments are increasingly shutting off the Internet, supposedly to thwart everyone from protesters to exam cheats. Millions of people are routinely cut off on someone\u0026rsquo;s whim, with zero rules or oversight. This is unacceptable. Even for stopping riots — the official justification often provided for many shutdowns — there is evidence that blackouts do more harm than good. Cutting off Internet access prevents innocent people from using the Internet to learn about trouble spots to stay away from, from reaching out for help and from making sure that loved ones are safe.\nThere is little evidence that that harm is even prevented by Internet shutdowns. Misinformation spreads when credible sources are inaccessible; the Internet, like other mass media, is a powerful tool to restore order.

Internet shutdowns are an absolute restriction placed on the use of internet services due to an order issued by a government body. It may be limited to a specific place and to specific period, time or number of days. Sometimes it can even extend indefinitely. An internet shutdown may be limited to mobile internet that you use on smartphones, or the wired broadband that usually connects a desktop - or both at the same time.\n  The Centre for Communications Governance has referred to a shutdown as an, “internet kill switch”. Read more\n  The Digital Empowerment Foundation in a recent report has called them, “digital curfews”. Read more\n  The Center for Internet \u0026amp; Society, Bangalore in a recent report has identified six categories of disruptions, “national internet, subnational internet, national mobile internet, subnational mobile internet, national app/service, and subnational app/service”. Read more\n  The KeepItOn campaign coordinated by Access Now has noted: “An internet shutdown happens when someone — usually a government — intentionally disrupts the internet or mobile apps to control what people say or do. Shutdowns are also sometimes called “blackouts” or “kill switches”. Here’s a more technical definition developed by experts: “An internet shutdown is an intentional disruption of internet or electronic communications, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information”. Read more\n  What are some of the common reasons for restricting the use of the Internet? The reasons for shutting down the internet have often first been said to be to respond to concerns about law and order but they have only grown with time. Reasons for shutting down the internet now have included to ensure peace during a festival procession as well as to prevent cheating in exams.\n  The Digital Empowerment Foundation in a recent report has stated that, “[t]he reasons behind the shutdowns were not always properly described. in most cases, state governments allowed these shutdowns in the time of protests”. Read more\n  The Internet Democracy Project has in a stakeholder report stated that, “no checks and balances are in place to ensure that shutdowns are indeed legitimate… sometimes for reasons as frivolous as cheating on an exam”. Read more\n  How frequently, where, are Internet shutdowns done? We are quickly moving towards a digital life. Unfortunately as more of India gets connected to the Internet, the frequency and geographic extent of shutdowns are spreading. Research indicates that India ranks the highest in the number of internet shutdowns in 2016.\n  The year has barely started but as per the Centre for Communications Governance and we already have had six such incidents. This is in line with a growing trend to increasingly shut down the internet. See illustration on the number of internet shutdowns in India from 2010.\n  Even the number of places, internet shutdowns are only growing. The Digital Empowerment Foundation has prepared an interactive map to illustrate network shutdowns in more than 10 Indian states. See map of internet shutdowns in various Indian states\n  A study by Brookings lists India, globally as the country with the most number of internet shutdowns standing at a total of 22 in 2016. Read the complete report\n  Does blocking the internet even have any “actual” or “real” harm, or is it entirely about protecting freedom of expression? Shutting down the internet can lead to a direct harm to the economy of the country. Studies suggest that India loses at least $968 million (more than Rs.6000 crores) in a year due to internet shutdowns. There also has an adverse impact on common man, that is both short term and long term.\n  Reports by the Brookings Institute and by the Global Network Initiative discuss the economic cost of Internet Shutdowns.\n  The Gujarat Chamber of Commerce noted the impact of internet shutdowns in their state: “Communication through internet is the crux of business nowadays and this has hampered business transactions adversely. We are cut-off from international market completely” Read more.\n  Access Now states is quite well when it calls an internet shutdown, “a threat to human rights around the world. They harm everyone: businesses, emergency services, journalism, human rights defenders, and demonstrators.” Read more\n  If by shutting down the internet during a riot or a protest, the police will be able to save a few lives, why should we question it? There has been zero evidence that internet shutdowns help quell violence, because rioters are organized and have other ways to communicate — after all, we’ve had riots far longer than we’ve had the Internet.\nIn fact, shutting down the Internet might delay the return to normalcy: rioters go home when they think the Government is back in control; an information blackout is a strong signal that it is not.\n  During the Kaveri riots, Bangalore police posted frequently on Facebook and Twitter about their presence in various troubled areas, using the Internet to amplify their on-the-ground presence and help restore normalcy.

Union of India \u0026amp; Ors. [WP(C) 341/2008] that are undermining internet freedom, particularly the right of free expression online. The case concerns allegations that search engines are acting in contravention of S. 22 of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”) insofar as they are showing results relating to sex determination kits and techniques. A series of orders passed in the case throw up the worrying prospect of undermining intermediary liability exemptions, and hence increasing censorship without proper safeguards.\nInformation on the orders of the Court The Supreme Court, in its order dated 19.09.2016, following the submission of the Solicitor General of India, directed the respondents to develop a, “technique so that the moment any advertisement or search is introduced into the system, that will not be projected or seen by adopting the method of auto-block.” This, “doctrine of auto-block”, as per the Supreme Court, shall ensure that no one can access information that is prohibited under the Act. Such a doctrine of auto-block would also be supported by the blocking of the auto-completion of the search query. In order to develop these techniques, a list of words was approved for which auto-completion and results would be blocked and a warning would be showed. The Supreme Court also stated that this has to be an in-house procedure introduced by search engines to pro-actively filter content. To further prevent contravention of the Act, the Supreme Court in its Order dated 16.11.2016 stated that a nodal agency should be set up which will provide search engines the details of the website to be blocked because they were acting in contravention of the Act. This would be without the court examining the legality of specific requests. A further report on the hearing on 16.02.2017 as reported by the Center for Communications Governance is available here.\nConflict with the Shreya Singhal Judgement and International Norms The orders of the Supreme Court in the Sabu Mathew case suggest that intermediaries can be held liable even for information without prior knowledge. This is surprising, considering the landmark judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, where S.79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act was read down by the Supreme Court to mean that an intermediary can be held liable only when, “the intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge that a court order has been passed asking it to expeditiously remove or disable access to certain material must then fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to that material”.\nThe decision of the Supreme Court also conflicts with the view expressed by a host of committees on Internet rights and freedom of speech. The UN’s Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression has expressly stated that\n “[w]hile a notice-and-takedown system is one way to prevent intermediaries from actively engaging in or encouraging unlawful behavior in their services, it is subject to abuse by both State and private actors. Users who are notified by the service provider that their content has been flagged as unlawful often have little recourse or few resources to challenge the takedown. Moreover, given that intermediaries may still be held financially or in some cases criminally liable if they do not remove content upon receipt of notification of users regarding unlawful content, they are inclined to err on the side of safety by over-censoring potentially illegal content. Lack of transparency in the intermediaries’ decision making process also often obscures discriminatory practices or political pressure affecting the companies’ decisions. Furthermore, intermediaries, as private entities, are not best placed to make the determination of whether a particular content is illegal, which requires careful balancing of competing interests and consideration of defences.”\n Concerns that arise from the case We at the IFF are concerned with the developments in the Sabu Mathew George case and consider it problematic for a host of reasons.\nFirstly, the doctrine of auto-block can easily lead to legitimate information being censored. Even if the website uses the words in a legal manner, access is blocked because of the mere presence of the questionable terms. This leads to censorship of potentially legal information, and thereby dilutes the right of freedom of speech and expression.\nSecondly, the nodal agency established as per the 16.11.2016 order goes against the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009. This is because Rules prescribe that there will be a Committee for the examination of requests for blocking access will review each blocking request and verify whether or not it is in lines with S.69A of the IT Act. There is no such review committee as per the Sabu Mathew George case as the Nodal Agency is merely responsible for intimation of the request to the intermediary. Furthermore, as per the rules, intermediaries are provided a 48-hours window to respond to the request for blocking, whereas the Sabu Mathew George orders only provide for a 36-hours window.\nThirdly, the nature of the ban is more generic than content-specific. The very basis of the censorship is a list of words and their combinations that have been censored, and these words in themselves may not necessarily be illegal - and could in fact often result in censorship of medical literature and other likely legitimate discussions pertaining to this subject.\nIn light of these reasons, the Sabu Mathew George orders have caused a deep apprehension that the safeguards provided to intermediaries under the IT Act and as per the Shreya Singhal case would be diluted and would no longer effectively protect the intermediaries. Therefore, we urge that the Union Government - after obtaining legal opinion of its law officers - should make the following submissions in Court by filing a counter affidavit to support the rights of Internet users:\n That the doctrine of auto-block and blocking of auto-complete not be used as it leads to over-censorship and impacts the right of freedom of speech and expression. The doctrine of auto block is a dangerous act of censorship which would lack proper safeguards. Restate the safe harbors for intermediaries as contained in the judgment of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India and argue against their dilution. The position of law with respect to intermediary liability stated in Shreya Singhal should not undermined by carving out exemptions as being attempted in the Sabu Mathew George.

State governments love to shut off the Internet, supposedly to thwart everyone from protesters to exam cheats.

This is unacceptable.\nEven for stopping riots — the official justification for most shutdowns — there is evidence that blackouts do more harm than good. Cutting off Internet access prevents innocent people from using the Internet to learn about trouble spots to stay away from, from reaching out for help and from making sure that loved ones are safe.\nThere is little evidence that riots are actually stopped by Internet shutdowns. Misinformation spreads when credible sources are inaccessible; the Internet, like other mass media, is a powerful tool to restore order. Bangalore police understand this well — during the Kaveri riots in 2016, they used Twitter and WhatsApp effectively to prevent panic and highlight police presence in volatile areas.\nWhen governments shut down the Internet, the real objective is to prevent journalists and citizens sharing evidence of misconduct — whether you are a chief minister in India or lifelong dictator in Gambia.\nTo add insult to injury, we’re even made to pay for the Internet access we’re denied. Telcos pocket our money while politicians steal our freedom.\nInternet shutdowns are unnecessary, harmful, and have no place in a democracy. We demand credible measures to stop their indiscriminate use, including the following:\n1. Clearly condemn shutdowns: A statement of concern from the Prime Minister’s Office condemning internet shutdowns as violative of the fundamental right to access to the Internet.\n2. Stop using Section 144: An interministerial commitment and direction through the Ministry of Home Affairs to all state governments and the Indian Police Service expressly stating that using Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for internet shutdowns is illegal.\n3. Reform Shutdown laws: Commit to ensuring that the Constitution and other laws (IT Act, Telegraph Act) are not unlawfully bypassed, with the Union Govt commencing a consultation process on how to frame specific updated rules under these laws for preventing internet shutdowns and access.

State governments love to shut off the Internet, supposedly to thwart everyone from protesters to exam cheats. Millions of people are routinely cut off on someone\u0026rsquo;s whim, with zero rules or oversight. This is unacceptable.\nEven for stopping riots — the official justification for most shutdowns — there is evidence that blackouts do more harm than good. Cutting off Internet access prevents innocent people from using the Internet to learn about trouble spots to stay away from, from reaching out for help and from making sure that loved ones are safe.","title":"Petition Test"},{"content":"Yes!

Union of India [W.P. (C) 7663/2016]. The case related to a prayer by the petitioners regarding a threat to their privacy due to product changes in the popular messaging application WhatsApp. These changes related to its integration with the social media platform Facebook and the protections under the privacy policy of WhatsApp. We await the order of the court at this time.\nKarmanya\u0026rsquo;s case is not in isolation as, earlier this year RTI Activist Sudhir Yadav had approached the Supreme Court asking for a ban on WhatsApp. His petition urged that the deployment of encryption technologies would negatively impact national security was dismissed on June 29, 2016.\nBoth these cases demonstrate the lack of an institutional mechanism to protect user privacy and provide a remedy to citizens. In the absence of substantive clarity and an process to enforce it, people are constrained to file public interest petitions which remain ad-hoc remedies.\nIFF is concerned as to the lack of a referee in the form of a Privacy Commissioner or Data Protection Authority (DPA) in India. We express specific concern on the substantive movement on encryption regulations given the last version of the Draft Encryption Policy that was withdrawn after massive public outcry contained provisions that would have severely undermined user privacy.\nIndia today is one of the few major democracies with no government authority or institutional recourse to safeguard user privacy. There has been a complete lack of movement on the Privacy Bill since 2011 and the recommendations of the Justice Shah Commission on Privacy made in August, 2012. On the contrary the Union Government has made submissions casting doubt as to the origin of the constitutional right to privacy in a series of petitions [Justice K.S. Puttaswamy \u0026amp; Anr. v. Union of India \u0026amp; Others W.P. (C) 494/2012] challenging the UIDAI - a mandatory biometric identification scheme. A constitutional reference in this case has been pending with the Supreme Court since August 11, 2015. In the meantime further surveillance schemes have been announced and operationalised which operate under questionable legal standing.\nCollectively these developments give rise to considerable apprehension and fear. Today, citizens and internet users are concerned about their informational privacy and have little recourse in law.\nWe urge the union government to urgently take the following steps:\n  Make an express commitment as to the existence - and enforcement - of a constitutional right to privacy.\n  Officially involve civil society, technologists, and non-governmental experts in committees for consultation on any issues related to encryption and privacy. It is suggested that such an effort should be inclusive and involve stakeholders across the spectrum. A model to follow may be the DOT consultation on Network Neutrality which held focussed stakeholder meetings and invited a broad array of experts, and published a draft report for public comment.\n  Following these stakeholder consultations an approach paper identifying the main issues may be made public to invite comments and suggestions. This should be put up for public consultation following a transparent, inclusive model adopted by the TRAI.\n  All these processes may be followed in a time bound manner with the stated intent of introducing legislation that comprehensively, robustly protects the privacy of Indians.\n  About the Internet Freedom Foundation:\nThe Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) is an non-profit organisation that supports and advocates for a free and open Internet.

Notice was issued by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi on IFF\u0026rsquo;s application and arguments on the intervention will be heard after pleadings are filed.\nAs per public reports the case specifically titled, Laksh Vir Singh Yadav v. Union of India, involves an argument from the petitioner calling for the High Court to order the creation of a “right to be forgotten” legal regime in India, starting with request to “delist” publicly reported court judgments.\nThe Internet Freedom Foundation is concerned by this attempt to undermine our right to free expression and our right to information. The argument by the petitioner may create a broad, vague right to be forgotten allowing private parties to force the delisting of public information from our internet. This is especially troubling given that in would be in the absence of a comprehensive law on the Right to Privacy - a fundamental right which the Internet Freedom Foundation believes must be safeguarded for all Indians though the constitution and statute.\nThe Internet Freedom Foundation - as a non profit organisation established to further the rights of all Indians to a free and open Internet - is deeply concerned by the potential implications of this argument and is therefore engaging in this case before the Delhi High Court.

This includes making sure it remains open and free. The TRAI’s explanatory memorandum on the Discriminatory Pricing Regulation expressly acknowledges it by linking network neutrality to our fundamental right to speech and expression.\nOne of the steps to broaden our work has been by supporting the Office of Tathagata Satpathy with the www.speechbill.in effort. The Speech Bill online consultation aims to create greater awareness and present a legislative path to reform India’s broken defamation laws. The process of online consultation itself promotes transparency and rigour in law making.\nThe #SpeechBill principles have two main objectives. The repeal of the criminal law of defamation and the consolidation and reform of the civil law. We believe that the offence of criminal defamation places a disproportionate criminal sanction on mere speech. Many constitutional democracies have taken an electoral route to reform defamation laws. We believe that defamation law concerns all Indians, as it restricts not only their ability to speak but also to listen. It especially concerns people who are using the Internet given the prevalence of social media platforms and the broadcast of opinions and commentary to large audiences. The law of criminal defamation impacts of all of them, not only through the threat of prosecution but also how it causes censorship, by chilling speech which they would receive.\nMany people at the same time justify the criminal offence of defamation due to the ineffectiveness of the civil law. The civil law of defamation is supposed to result in a declaration to vindicate a person’s honor as well as give monetary damages. These damages are given not to penalize the defendant but to repair an injury. By their very nature they cannot be excessive, however today large amounts, running into hundreds and thousands of crores are claimed in Courts. This completely censors speech, as no matter the verdict, the existence of such a claim itself scares the speaker into silence. Even people who suffer a genuine injury, fairly value their claim and do not file the case in a remote, distant place have to wait decades for a decision. The civil law of defamation has two paradoxical problems, first it’s abuse and second it’s ineffectiveness. These deficiencies may be addressed through legislative action. Our legislature should consider consolidating the law of civil defamation, to make it clear, effective and balanced.\nIFF believes that content laws fundamentally interact with the Internet with most publications and more people coming online. Due to these reasons we support the SpeechBill.in effort. Some of our members are assisting in the outreach, legal drafting and technical support. There are many other volunteers besides us. We have reached out to other organizations and stakeholders seeking their comments and endorsement. We must fairly state that a private member’s bill has not passed through parliament into law in the last four decades. Despite such odds, at the very least we hope to help spark a policy conversation around content laws. We believe that this will change the present status quo on defamation reform in a non-partisan manner.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/iff-supports-speechbill-in/","summary":"IFF was launched from the roots of savetheinternet.in with an objective to support and preserve the charachter of the Internet.

The Internet Freedom Foundation regards this as a very important issue and we have formally submitted our inputs to this consultation; this post explains our position.\nIn the consultation paper, TRAI pointed out that our country has woefully few public WiFi hotspots, even compared to other countries far smaller than ours. It also outlined a farsighted vision for an ubiquitous network of hotspots run by small entrepreneurs across the country — the modern equivalent of the Public Call Office (PCO) — and asked what regulatory changes are needed to bring this about.\nAt the Internet Freedom Foundation, we’re excited about this goal. In addition to bringing the Internet to everyone, public WiFi will bring some sorely needed decentralization and competition in the Internet Service Provider space.\nNeedless to say, big telcos are out in force trying to scuttle this vision, arguing that in their interpretation of current law only they can run public hotspots - and that’s the only way things ought to be.\nWe disagree. Three major changes are essential for public WiFi to take off:\n  One, anyone should be allowed to set up a public hotspot. This might seem like a no-brainer, but under current regulations only Unified Access Service License (UASL) holders can sell Internet access — something that needs hundreds of crores in the bank. We believe that re-selling Internet access using technologies that don’t need licensed spectrum or right-of-way (like WiFi, which is provided via delicensed spectrum bands) should not require a UASL.\n  Two, the pointless KYC requirements supposedly created “for fighting terror” should be scrapped. These are trivially bypassed by criminals and terrorists using forged documents or simple technical measures. On the other hand, they hinder law-abiding users, expose people to identity theft and other digital security threats, and impose unreasonably high costs on low-margin WiFi hotspot operators preventing them from being deployed in rural and low-income areas. Most importantly, these requirements are completely ineffective in fighting terrorism — — and are now being phased out in other countries even for pre-paid SIM cards. India should follow their example.\n  Third, all unlicensed spectrum bands used internationally should be made available in India. Already in use for WiFi and other emerging technologies like WiGig, de-licensing these bands will be critical to allow a high density of WiFi devices and new wireless technologies to operate, especially in dense urban areas.\n  We have expanded on all three points, especially on issues related to KYC, in our submission to TRAI.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/troubleshooting-indias-wifi/","summary":"A recently-closed consultation paper by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) explored how public WiFi could bring high-speed Internet to a large number of unconnected Indians.

All existing consultations should be closed with specific recommendations. The reasons for conducting future consultations should be flagged and reasoned expressly, so that members of the public and other stakeholders in this issue can meaningfully engage and contribute.\n  An attempt should be made for substantial agreement to a framework of technical and economic equality which forms the core of net neutrality. This must be ensured through telecom regulation rather than competition law given that an expert, technical regulator needs to exercise constant oversight over telecom service providers. A clear policy statement on core principles and regulatory outline on initial enforcement for network neutrality in India could provide initial flexibility and aid in future rulemaking.\n  Rules which are made to ensure network neutrality may individually fall within the jurisdiction of the TRAI or may be incorporated as express provisions or amendments to the existing language of telecom licensing conditions. In any event an attempt should be made to ensure a strong legal basis for any rulemaking. A conscious effort should be made to bring certainty and stability given that litigation may upset the progress made over the past two years, and add impediments to the commitment to protecting net neutrality made across party lines in Parliament.\n  Though security and privacy are key public interest priorities, it appears at present that they also being used by telecom operators (as evidenced through their earlier submissions) to argue for further regulation, licensing and imposing burdens on online services. Regulatory discussions regarding security should be specific and keep regulatory compliance limited to serve that interest alone.\n  Similarly the privacy of users is an important interest which needs to be urgently addressed. However the TRAI is not the proper body which can ensure an adjudicatory and regulatory system which is available to individuals on issues concerning privacy due to the limitations of the TRAI Act. Further even the DOT may not be able to provide this even by changes in the license conditions. Given these limitations we request the TRAI to make a recommendation given the importance of user privacy that a comprehensive privacy law is made in India, and carry forward the earlier legislative discussion on this topic which has been pending before the Department of Personnel and Training and the Ministry of Law and Justice.\n  We are greatly concerned with question no. 6 which seems to ignore more than a million responses of ordinary Indians against the licensing of online services, including those which enable easy communications via computer to computer VoIP functionality and other features. We would like to restate our earlier submissions that have consistently made the point that radically seeking to further regulate online communications by requiring the licensing of internet applications and web services is not an issue of network neutrality. It is being conflated by Telecom Service Providers who are seeking to extract rents through regulation. Even issues of licensing of online applications and services do need to be considered by the TRAI it should be through an independent consultation. Bundling the licensing of online services within a network neutrality consultation is doctrinally inconsistent and gives the appearance of bartering to safeguard the interests of telecom service providers at the cost of end users and innovators who benefit from the free and open internet.\n  A full copy of the submission can be accessed here (Link).\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/iff-on-the-pre-consultation-paper-on-net-neutrality/","summary":"July 5, 2016\nThe Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) made its submissions on the TRAI\u0026rsquo;s pre-consultation on Net Neutrality.\nWe specifically requested the TRAI to approach any future consultation on net neutrality in the following manner:\n  A clear roadmap should be prescribed for network neutrality rulemaking in India.

If you are looking for something specific, or have a query, reach out to us at info@internetfreedom.in\nWhat is IFF? The IFF is an Indian digital liberties organisation that seeks to ensure that technology respects fundamental rights. Our goal is to ensure that Indian citizens can use the Internet with liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.\nOur expertise in free speech, digital surveillance and privacy, net neutrality will help us to champion freedom in the digital age. We spur grassroots membership through public campaigns and take them towards institutional engagement with regulators, legislative bodies and courts.\nWe were originally a group of volunteers who worked on the SavetheInternet.in campaign. In order to make a meaningful and lasting contributing towards a free and open Internet, we banded together to incorporate an organisation, set up to support research regarding the online freedoms and rights of Indian citizens.\nWe are incorporated as a public charitable trust registered in New Delhi, and are granted exemptions under Sections 12A and 80G of the Indian Income Tax Act.\nWhy does IFF exist?   Digital freedom is our common path: With almost 4 out of 10 Indians online in January, 2019 we form the second largest number of Internet users in the world. We are special, not only due to our numbers, but due to our political system operating on democratic values and enforceable guarantees of fundamental rights. We must protect them in the choices and design of technology.\n  Technology has the power to fulfil constitutional ideals: India has been an enthusiastic adopter of the innovation, convenience and gains offered by digitisation. Today, technology is a form of power which enables, but also prevents human liberty. The IFF exists to ensure that such ongoing changes in our lives are positive;that they serve constitutional goals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity for individuals.\n  Freedom needs champions and advocates: India, to its credit, has a robust network of research and policy organisations that work on digital rights issues in India. But, a bottleneck exists in maintaining sustained, planned public advocacy. We need a fighting force that demands accountability, and spurs action in an organised manner.\n  How does the IFF work?   Strategy comes first: We support the passion and skills of our volunteers to plan and execute all our work based on strategic thinking and towards outcomes which are clearly mapped towards policy goals. We start with a plan.\n  We bridge the public and policy divide: The IFF complements, and even hopes, to bridge gaps in digital rights organisations, larger civil liberties groups and online collectives and movements. We take considered risks, make a stand and follow a path of advocacy towards outcomes. As digitisation grows in our lives, there is a greater need for our rights to be protected from infringement. We need to do much more to protect Internet freedoms in India. Our culture comes from the SaveTheInternet.in movement on net neutrality, and our work relies on civic education and engagement. Our model draws the public into processes which otherwise lack glamour and wider engagement. Technology and user rights are mainstream concerns impacting a growing number of Indians and need greater resources and organisational infrastructure. Online users often ask for help, but a lack of capacity in the campaigning ecosystem is noted. We hope to accelerate these efforts so that the entire ecosystem is benefitted.\n  Building community for public victories: Volunteer groups require long-term support to grow a diverse, inclusive and powerful base. An active organisational backbone is pivotal to building a membership base, as well as to ensure that the growing community endures over time. There is strength in numbers, and as more Indians come online, we need to ensure that they advocate for their rights. This will bring greater certainty to achieve, maintain and extend victories on digital rights. We have a collaborative and flexible work culture which matches a large, diverse group of volunteers organised by staff. We talk one-on-one to volunteers, to utilise their time, skills and interest into workgroups. By organising over time, we aim to grow a cadre of digital rights leaders working towards common goals. We encourage Indian citizen volunteers to offer us financial support for helping us to become a vibrant grassroots organisation.\n  We are no strangers to campaigns: We build online public-facing campaigns in India (5, and counting ) continuing the work of many founders who built the net neutrality movement. We use tech tools, VOX style video explainers, write articles, summaries and analysis papers. This brings greater power to our advocacy actions.\n  Channeling advocacy into institutional outcomes: Much of our work involves understanding how institutions work. We navigate this maze, engaging with decision makers to ensure systematic victories. This includes engaging with regulators, drafting digital rights legislation and parliamentary motions, sending notices and going to court and litigating to protect our freedoms. We do our work with courage and we dream big, but always with strategy, care and reflection.\n  Who funds the IFF? As a legal entity we operate on principles of transparency, inclusion and community. We believe that this will, in part, be achieved through support and partnership with organisations which work to further our core values. We have recently launched a recurring membership option for IFF supporters and will also explore other avenues of funding such as projects and organisational membership to accelerate our work.\n  We are independent of political parties and corporations: We are unaffiliated with any political party or organisation. Our stances are guided by constitutionalism and fundamental rights as they intersect with technology. We are not associated with any company, industry association or non-government organisation. We form our positions independently, and implement them through issue-specific partnerships.\n  Our charter and core donors are individual Indians: We engage in continuous community buildings and civic engagement. The IFF collective includes enthusiasts from various fields: technology, law, journalism, design, policy. Many of us are entrepreneurs. We have received monetary support from more than 350 people in this growing community. At present, we raise funds from Indians who share our values. These funds will be used to promote and advocate a free and open internet that offers freedom, privacy and innovation.\n  We are transparent about how we use our contributors’ funds: We intend to publish a detailed statement of accounts on fund use with key insights and infographics to let people know how we use their money. At present we disclose the monthly donations we recieve through individuals and also have set up a page on our financial disclosures.\n  Who are the people behind the IFF?

Over 1 million Indian citizens have participated at one point or another in the campaign that was started by a group of like minded individuals across India in May 2015.\nIn 2014, Indian Redditors began discussing net neutrality when Airtel decided to charge extra for Voice Over IP (VoIP) services like Skype. This discussion led to the launch of netneutrality.in, a website that explained the importance of net neutrality and Airtel’s threat to it. After seeing public outrage and discussion, Airtel withdrew their decision and this marked the first time that the principles of net neutrality gained mainstream media and public attention. This also resulted in the important question being raised around the lack of policy around net neutrality in India.\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), after being urged by the public and telecos alike, agreed to a public consultation on the issue of net neutrality. This paper was made public on 27th March 2015.\nSave The Internet volunteers created an abridged version of the paper and the campaign went into full swing when savetheinternet.in, a platform to submit comments to the TRAI consultation paper, was launched and pushed out by the comedy collective All India Bakchod.\nThrough various interventions and with the support of the public, dozens of influencers, organisations, and experts, in early 2016, we won a large part of our net neutrality campaign when TRAI announced that differential pricing would be banned in India.\nOn March 18, 2019, Internet Freedom Foundation re-activated SaveTheInternet.in. This decision was taken in light of the continous violation of Net Neutrality in the form of website blockings by various ISP\u0026rsquo;s through the months of December, 2018 and March, 2019. SaveTheInternet.in includes a reporting tool for the public to send reports of any blockings or forms of network interference that may be violative in nature. In addition, it provides individuals and organisations with the opportunity to show support to a list of joint demands, which are then sent to the relevant government offices through the “Take Action Petition”. The campaign aims to ensure TRAI and DOT devise the necessitated enforcement mechanisms in efforts to maintain the principles of Net Neutrality in India.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/campaigns-savetheinternet/","summary":"The SaveTheInternet campaign is a volunteer led effort to uphold a fair and open Internet.

This is prominently visible in the IT and online services sector. By building companies which foster innovation and utility online services are making everyday life simpler, efficient and more enjoyable. Every segment of our nation’s society and industry stands to benefit by being connected to an open Internet.\nWhile legal regulation is urgently required in several areas of internet policy in India there is a need to recognise its impact on innovation. We have historically seen that permission based systems such as those which require prior licensing only promote red tape and overheads. We believe that prior licensing or registration denies Indians an opportunity to have unbiased access to the solutions that our talented entrepreneurs are devising.\nAnother negative effect of local registration requirements or onerous legal compliances is the potential for preventing access to global web services. Often termed as the fragmentation of the internet, this will prevent the best of the web from being accessed in India. We believe this will set back innovation in India and also prevent users from accessing the best of the global web.\nThe chilling effects on online content by overbroad intellectual property laws is well documented. Even today, efforts are made through john doe injunctions to block entire web services through nebulous legal claims. Even our existing legal provisions for intermediary liability do not incorporate necessary safeguards.

While the use of personal information to deliver advertisements is a historical model for internet services, the dangers it poses are becoming clear only now. These risks emerge from both, private and state entities.\nWithout privacy, internet users modify their private behaviour out of fear. It takes away the ability of people to make important choices about their life \u0026mdash; it removes personal autonomy. It is important to consider that India at present does not have any comprehensive law to protect the privacy of internet users and this requires further work.\nMany people do not understand privacy and some even dispute its very existence. This stems from a lack of proper articulation on privacy \u0026ndash; given that privacy is a bundle of rights. We aim to create awareness on privacy and practices which can be followed by Internet users to protect it.\nThe legal right to privacy is under severe threat in India. Due to submissions by the Union Government in a case concerning the constitutionality of India’s biometric identification program the fundamental right to privacy has been thrown into doubt. India also does not have a comprehensive privacy statute. We support the constitutional right to privacy and believe a comprehensive, citizen friendly law to enforce it is urgently needed in India.\nBeyond a legal right to privacy its understanding will constantly evolve as technology becomes more pervasive and can capture more personal data. In situations such as these it is important to understand the benefits and risks associated with technology and then prescribe applicable policy and legal fixes. We believe that increased technology adoption has immense value which can be properly harnessed within a privacy framework.\nThe internet and digital technologies today provide tremendous utility to our daily lives. With time our dependence on them will only grow. There is a need to keep the personal data that is collected from each person by such services. This can to a large measure be implemented by secure communications. We believe that data security should be implemented through the wider adoption and legal recognition of advanced encryption technologies in the interest of end users.\nThe legal surveillance regime in India follows an imperfect, non-transparent executive system which works without any scrutiny. There is an acute absence of any checks and balances which leads to phone tapping provisions being abused. We believe that any system of surveillance requires prior-judicial review and notice to the person when the surveillance ceases.\nThe snowden revelations have illustrated the creeping nature of secretive mass surveillance where each bit of data is mined, extracted and analysed. This is the very definition of a surveillance state which prevents transparency on itself and at the same time keeps a constant watch over citizens. We are concerned with the recent announcements of mass surveillance programs in India which do not operate under any clear legal authority. We oppose mass surveillance in principle and believe it is inconsistent with our fundamental rights under the Constitution of India.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/issues-privacy/","summary":"As a growing number of Indians come online there is a sense of being under a perpetual state of surveillance.

It is a great enabler of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. This needs to be protected for everyone. Working to strengthen free expression online IFF hopes to be guided by certain key values listed below.\nCensorship today is carried out by a whole host of persons and entities beyond the bounds of law. We strongly oppose any illegal censorship by government and non-state actors on the internet.\nThe Indian legal system contains a number of provisions which limit free expression. Some - like the erstwhile Section 66A - are laws specifically made to censor online speech. We oppose vague, medium specific laws that have a chilling effect on online speech.\nThere are several other laws which criminalise speech. Many such laws are inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Reports of the Special Rapporteur on Free Expression and several other sources of human rights law which bind India. Our hate speech laws, the penal provision for defamation requires urgent reform. We support this growing movement away from criminalising or penalising speech to promote a web of free and fair discussion.\nNew laws create the potential for intermediary liability which can chill free speech and expression. Such laws also lead to pro-active takedowns and content filtering. We support laws which promote immunity for intermediaries. We also expect intermediaries to be transparent in their content takedowns supporting the interests of end users.\nInternet shutdowns are extraordinary measures which are used by repressive, authoritarian regimes to limit flows of information. Even in times of public disorder they lead to censorship of content that is otherwise legal and can be used to calm and assure large numbers of people. We support the right of Indians to constant flows of information and oppose internet shutdowns and curfews.\nInternet filters even though not implemented in India are increasingly being advocated to implement censorship. We believe that any filter would lead to a disproportionate system of censorship which would only grow with time.\nWebsite blocking today is carried out in a secretive process in which authors and end users of content do not get notices or an opportunity to respond. Secret orders are passed which deprive persons of legal remedies. We will work towards reforming website blocking to make it proportionate, transparent and implemented by following the principles of natural justice.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/issues-censorship/","summary":"The Internet has reduced barriers to communication.

This includes ensuring that network providers do not supply any competitive advantage to specific apps/services, either through pricing or Quality of Service”. We believe all aspects of network neutrality require protection through clear government rules and regulations.\nNet neutrality allows us to have the choice to visit and experience every site or application equally without any discrimination in terms of price, speed or availability from a telecom company. This freedom allows us to create, communicate and collaborate with people across the globe and for businesses to combine audio, video and text, and reimagine consumer experience. We want an open Internet, where everyone has an equal opportunity to use the sites and services they want, when they want, irrespective of which provider they use to connect to the Internet.\nThe SavetheInternet.in website helped more than million Indians voice their support for net neutrality to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).

Despite attempts by a few stakeholders to undermine this process, TRAI has stood firm, which is a testament to India’s maturing regulatory framework.\nThose volunteering with SaveTheInternet.in would, in particular, like to thank everyone in India and around the world who came out in support of Net Neutrality for their contribution and support throughout this movement. This includes lakhs of individuals, research organizations, advocacy groups, professors and academic institutions, captains of industry, and politicians cutting across party lines. We would also like to thank the media for sharing our positions with the public. We look forward to your continued support in ensuring that the internet remains free and open for all Indians.\nWe’d also like to thank the Government of India and in particular, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for their continued support and commitment to programmes for improving access to the Internet, such as Digital India, and their support for entrepreneurship, such as Startup India. For such initiatives to succeed in serving the growing needs and aspirations of Indian society and economy, it is imperative that Net Neutrality is observed.\nHowever, it is important to remember the following:\n  Two key aspects of the Net Neutrality consultation that remain: firstly, the proposed requirement for providers of VoIP services like Whatsapp, Viber and Skype to obtain a government licence, which would mean that telecom operators could be required to treat traffic from unlicensed VoIP providers differently from the rest, and secondly, allowing telecom operators the ability to slow down and speed up websites, giving them the ability to play king-makers and gate-keepers. Citizens should be vigilant, as always, and should consider participating in this process in the future. SaveTheInternet opposes any form of licensing of Internet Services. This includes VoIP.\n  Telecom operators, during the course of the last year, have mentioned that they are likely to go to court if the TRAI verdict doesn’t go their way. We would request them from refraining from doing so: such an anti-consumer move would be unfortunate, as we believe Net Neutrality would be covered under free speech protections provided under Article 19 of the Indian constitution.\n  Additionally, TRAI also has a consultation process that is on-going regarding the pricing of broadband services in India.

Signatories include well known entrepreneurs like Vijay Shekhar Sharma of One97 and Paytm, Deepinder Goyal of Zomato, Sairee Chahal of Sheroes, Paras Chopra from Wingify, Santosh Panda of Explara, Manish Vij of the Smile Vun Group, Hrush Bhatt of Cleartrip, Archit Gupta of Cleartax, Avlesh Singh of WebEngage, Abhinav Lal from Practo, and investors such as Mahesh Murthy, Brij Bhasin from Rebright Partners, Navin Honagudi from Kae Capital, Ritesh Banglani from Stellaris, Sanjay Swamy from Prime Venture Partners, Vishal Gupta from Bessemer Venture Partners and Abhishek Gupta from TLabs. Startup ecosystem support bodies such as iSPIRT and Headstart Network have also signed the letter. The entire list is available at http://www.savetheinternet.in/startups-pm-letter/#viewsigns\nThe letter, released on the eve of the Republic Day, welcomes Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s support for India’s Startup community through Startup India and Digital India, while pointing out that these initiatives aren’t complete without the support for Net Neutrality – a principle that assures Internet Service Providers don’t discriminate for or against online apps and services, on the basis of availability, speed, or cost of access, leaving that choice to the end user alone. The letter is intended to urge the PM to come out and issue a statement in full support of the net neutrality.\nIt states:\n“In the wake of the important messages made by you on helping drive forward Startup India, and on the eve of the Republic Day celebration of our nation\u0026rsquo;s commitment to democracy, we are writing to you, seeking your continued support for Net Neutrality.”\nThis letter comes a few days after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India held an Open House on their Consultation on Differential Pricing, where many startups, web services, policy experts spoke about the importance of net neutrality, and the harms of differential pricing.\nVolunteers at SaveTheInternet.in, a coalition of individuals who have been leading the fight for a neutral Internet for almost a year now urge startups to sign the letter. Mitesh Ashar, volunteer at SaveTheInternet and a co-founder of the Headstart Network Foundation, said “Startups are the heart of our country\u0026rsquo;s innovation. They are the ones who are going to solve the problems of tomorrow and make Digital India a success. Differential pricing, which includes zero-rating, will give disproportionate power to platforms and access service providers by giving them the ability to favor some services over others, hence friction for startups.” A copy of the letter and list of signatories is available at: http://www.savetheinternet.in/startups-pm-letter/\nFor more information, contact:\nKiran Jonnalagadda: 99452 35123\nMitesh Ashar: 81978 66622\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/startups-pm-letter/","summary":"Startups join hands to congratulate the PM for Startup India and Digital India, but stress on the importance of net neutrality to achieve initiatives\n25 January 2016: Over 500 startup founders from across India have signed a letter asking for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s continued support for net neutrality.\nThe letter, released by volunteers at the SaveTheInternet.in Coalition, has 1046 signatories, including 528 startup founders.

As a group of volunteers part of the Save the Internet Campaign, we have been engaging on the issue of Network Neutrality for much of the past year. It is a matter of distress that Facebook, through its internet.org platform and in its lobbying on regulatory consultations, has sought to undermine Net Neutrality in India and also increasingly questioned the motives of more than a million Indians who have participated in consultations organised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) as well as the Department of Telecom.\nYesterday, in your townhall address at IIT Delhi, you mentioned that “Those who don’t have access to the Internet cannot sign online petitions,” trying to make a case that those who oppose of your Net Neutrality violating Internet.org/Free Basics service are campaigning against those who do not have Internet access. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many of us have benefited from the Internet because of the openness, plurality and diversity it has to offer. We want more people to get access to the internet—the entire internet—and not primarily the filter for the web that you have set up with Internet.org/Free Basics. We’d like to remind you that Tim Berners-Lee, one of the founding fathers of the Internet who strives for expanding its use by the entire web recently called Zero Rating “Economic Discrimination”, saying that “Economic discrimination is just as harmful as technical discrimination, so ISPs will still be able to pick winners and losers online.”\nEven today, Internet.org has restrictions that those services which compete with telecom operator services will not be allowed on it. WhatsApp would have never emerged on this platform. You also reserve the right to reject services from Internet.org. We fail to understand why, if it is an open platform, someone even needs to apply, and conform to your pre-defined technical limitations, and has to go through unspecified checks determined by your organization.\nInternet.org is not an open platform, and all we are asking for, is for you to ensure that any such effort to bring access to the Internet ensure that users get access to the entire Internet, and not through a pre-determined menu or filter, which primarily benefits those who are selected for the platform. While we understand that there is currently no paid arrangement between Facebook, its partners and telecom operators, and you’ve suggested that this is a philanthropic endeavour, there is no undertaking from you that there won’t be any future arrangements for Facebook’s benefit. Internet businesses like Facebook and Google have been built around the idea of offering services for free in the beginning, and then monetization through means such as advertising. This is keeping in mind the choice of the “.com” URL for FreeBasics.com, as opposed to a “.org” for Internet.org.\nYou’ve also suggested that universal access is more important than Net Neutrality, and that there is a possibility of taking Net Neutrality “too far”. That is plausible if, and only if there aren’t any options available which provide universal access without violating Net Neutrality. Some examples, in case you haven’t heard of them:\n The Mozilla Foundation runs a program with Grameenphone, where users get free data in exchange for watching an advertisement. The Mozilla Foundation also runs a program with Orange in Africa, where those who purchase a $37 handset get 500 MB of free data. There are data cashback schemes such as Gigato offer data for free, for surfing some sites. Airtel has launched night plans, which give data as a cashback upon usage of the Internet between midnight and 6am, helping bring cost of access down.  Therefore, one does not have to choose between Universal Access and Net Neutrality. Qualitative research has found that less experienced, low income groups prefer access to an open and unrestricted Internet, and “some access is better than none”, but the trade-off they are willing to make is how much they use the internet, not necessarily how much of the internet they get to use. Therefore, the research indicates that users also don’t want that false choice between Net Neutrality and Access.\nIt’s also a matter of concern that data for all the websites on Internet.org will be with Facebook, and restrictions are placed on them publicly disclosing usage of their sites and services by users on Internet.org. Apart from the fact that no open platform places such restrictions, this data and the learnings gained from it gives a competitive advantage to Facebook, because of the competitive advantage given to Internet.org by its telecom operator partners.\nLastly, we’d like to point out that Free Basics does nothing to help address India’s key problem—not one of getting more users online, given that the IAMAI has reported that we’ve added as many as 52 million Internet users in the last six months alone—but of improving access infrastructure so that users get seamless high speed connectivity. We need to focus on growing the pie, not splitting the pie. Our concern with Internet.org/Free Basics is that it will create a new digital divide: those who access Facebook and its partner services, and those who access the open Internet.\nThere are ways of providing Internet access in a manner that is open, so that everyone gets access to the whole of the Internet, without discrimination between web services, and without violating Net Neutrality. Don’t forget that Facebook benefited from this openness and neutrality. Facebook, along with its intentions to connection billions to the Internet, should support and advocate for Net Neutrality and permissionless innovation in India, the way it has done in the US.\nSigned, The Savetheinternet.in team\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/response-to-facebook-townhall/","summary":"Dear Mark Zuckerberg,\nWe thank you for your recent visit and your continued interest in India.

It can\u0026rsquo;t be anybody\u0026rsquo;s case that one technology or service triumphs, not because of competitive advantage but due to a regulatory regime. The impact of any regulation, if we propose any, on over-the-top services will be considered in all its facets.\n Service providers have tools to distinguish between such calls. One such is called Deep Packet Inspection. source: ET\nWe\u0026rsquo;re not sure of how they\u0026rsquo;re going to conduct the open house sessions. From what we\u0026rsquo;ve heard from sources, the TRAI believes that only 66k submissions were relevant, not 1 million.\n  DoT process: AIB released a video explaining, most importantly, how an attempt was being made to change the definition of Net Neutrality. MyGov got 73k+ comments\nWe\u0026rsquo;re not sure of how things will play out from here on, but the DoT will wait for the TRAI process to begin.\n  Parliamentary Standing Committee: The Committee has, from what we know, so far met Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, DoT, TRAI, Civil Society including many of us from Save The Internet, apart from DEF, SFLC and CIS), Facebook, Microsoft, Cleartrip, Flipkart, and Academia (Prof Vishal Misra from Columbia and Prof Manjunath from IIT Bombay). There might be more rounds of meetings, but so far, we don\u0026rsquo;t know. From what I understand from sources, among the Internet companies, Facebook shared some new data, but they deposed alone. Cleartrip, Flipkart and Microsoft supported Net Neutrality, which is good. Google was invited to attend but backed out at the last minute.\n  In Parliament: Nothing noteworthy wrt Net Neutrality since, though questions about Privacy and Airtel inserting code have been raised by MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar . In case there\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve missed, please let me know. MP Tathagata Satpathy spoke about a host of issues including net neutrality in the Lok Sabha.\n  Internet Industry: Facebook and Google tried to play funny at the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), trying to force them to change their stand. Google, in particular, was surprising, but now we know that they want Zero Rating. STAR also wants Zero Rating, which the company has now clarified to me. From what I understand, the IAMAI will now oppose Zero Rating given that their governing council has allowed them to take the majority view. It\u0026rsquo;s almost as if it\u0026rsquo;s only Facebook, Google and Star versus the rest of the Internet companies, and there is a clear division: none of the major Indian Internet companies support Zero Rating, but will be forced to adopt it if it becomes a competitive scenario.\n  Facebook\u0026rsquo;s tactics: This is getting worrying now. Facebook not only ran a misleading campaign on its own website, it also has been running TV ads, ads in cinema halls and in newspapers. Apart from this, and I\u0026rsquo;ve confirmed this from a few journalists who got invites, they\u0026rsquo;re taking journalists on an all expenses paid trip to San Francisco to meet Facebook\u0026rsquo;s leadership team on the 24th, and Mark Zuckerberg on the 27th. The PM Narendra Modi is also going to San Francisco, and will be hosting a townhall with Zuckerberg on Sunday, September 27 at 10PM IST/9:30am PST. This is quite discouraging, and we can only hope that the PM won\u0026rsquo;t decide in favor of Internet.org.\n  What can we do?  TRAI Process: Wait DoT Process: Wait Standing Committee Process: Wait Internet Industry: Try and ask startups and Indian Internet companies to be more vocal in favor of Net Neutrality. None of the Industry associations have been vocal, whether NASSCOM, IAMAI or Ispirt. Not sure of what to do here. Facebook:  Inform journalists that they need to disclose that FB is paying for their trip in their articles, and that we\u0026rsquo;re going to judge their piece on whether it is taking a one sided view.

To do this,\n Registeron the MyGov.in website Sign into MyGov.in Visit the net neutrality pageand submit a response.  Please see sample points below that you may use. You may submit each paragraph as a different post on MyGov.\nText #1\n Government must act now\n  The DoT Report noted that a free and open Internet, available to all Indian citizens, is key to our country\u0026rsquo;s future. Despite that, telcos are already violating net neutrality and endangering that future. The Govt should pass regulation immediately to protect net neutrality in India - the status quo of mere promises is not enough. The Govt must commit to protecting net neutrality in law in India. Don\u0026rsquo;t take 5 years to decide this.\n Explanation regarding government process: While the regulatory process is being drawn out, telcos are already violating net neutrality in various ways. Our government must put an end to this.\nText #2\n Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING without discrimination\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t allow telecom operators to change the definition of Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality means access to EVERYTHING on the Internet, without discrimination. Not access to everyone. We want everyone to get access, but to all of the Internet. Don\u0026rsquo;t allow creation of private walled gardens.\n Text #3\n Don’t allow Zero Rating\n  Zero rating allows large companies to act as gatekeepers of the Internet, and control which services Indians can access, must be prohibited. The DoT draft recommendations are too weak on this, and the Govt must take a strong stand to protect users.\n Text #4\n Don’t allow Zero Rating, not even on a case-by-case basis\n  Zero rating will encroach upon the bandwidth meant for the open Internet, decreasing its speed and increasing its price. The Govt should ensure that licensed spectrum is exclusively used to give open internet access to consumers, and not to sell consumers to big internet companies. There should be a complete ban on zero rating, not case-by-case approval.\n Text #5\n Don’t allow Zero Rating\n  Zero rating will enable well-funded Internet companies to purchase captive user bases, killing off smaller competitors and then increasing prices to recover the cost. It will decrease choice and harm consumers not only on the zero rating plans but also on the open Internet. The Govt should prohibit zero rating completely instead of giving approval on a case-by-case basis.\n Text #6\n Don’t allow Zero Rating, not even on a case-by-case basis\n  Case-by-case approval of zero rating, as proposed in the report, is an invitation to lobbying and corruption. The government should make objective, unambiguous rules, not leave complex decisions affecting crores in profits to some corruptible bureaucrats. Remember that this is an industry that has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about paying huge bribes at the highest levels of government.\n Explanation regarding Zero Rating: Zero rating is telcos’ plan to split the Internet into two — the real one where telcos sell Internet access to consumers, and a “zero internet” where they sell consumers to big Internet companies. On these plans, all websites and apps except a handful will be blocked. This split damages the real Internet and affects everyone — not just those on zero plans.\nText #7\n Scrap the proposal to license VoIP apps\n  There should be no license-permit raj for the web. The Govt must not adopt regressive measures such as forcing licenses for Internet communication services or mobile apps. The proposal to license VoIP is completely against the consumer interest — it will decrease choice, increase prices and stifle innovation.\n Text #8\n No licensing of VoIP\n  The term “Regulatory Arbitrage” cannot hide the fact that DoT\u0026rsquo;s objective with VoIP licensing is to decrease choice and increase prices for consumers, in order to help certain telcos. It is very worrying that a government body, which is supposed to uphold consumer interest above all else, chooses instead to go against it.\n Text #9\n We don\u0026rsquo;t want licensing of VoIP\n  The proposal to license domestic VoIP will prevent Indian startups from creating a wide range of communication, collaboration, gaming and social networking services that include voice, while startups everywhere else will continue to do so. This new license-permit raj will damage our country’s knowledge economy, just as the old one suffocated our industries.\n Explanation regarding VoIP: VoIP refers to apps like Skype, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, Viber etc. that carry voice over the Internet, allowing us to call people for free.

This contradicts your view of OTTs eating into your revenues. Please explain.\n  What is the Internal Rate of Return for individual telecom operators over a 5 year period? Markets have competition, and if the smaller telecom operators are in trouble, why should the government bail them out? Telecom operators themselves say that there is high competition, and there are too many telecom operators in India. Why should the situation of a few telecom operators be used to benefit those who are doing well, to the detriment of consumers?\n  In November, Airtel and other operators requested the government to drastically bring down the USOF levy that they pay, by arguing that they were already doing a good job of providing rural connectivity. How then are they now arguing that they must have a right to charge a levy from Internet companies in order to fund rural connectivity? (source: Economic Times)\n  Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said in February that Airtel doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any additional investment in CapEx for enabling data services. Where is the need for infrastructure investment required for providing data services then?\n  Won’t Zero Rating create a situation where telecom operators will carry content only for those companies that pay them?\n  What are the privacy issues related to Zero Rating, and what sort of usage will telecom operators be able to track? Will they not be able to see exactly what content is being viewed by each user?\n  Will zero rated services, platforms such as Airtel Zero and Internet.org harm smaller players and startups? Do you have any selection criteria outside of money for zero rating? How do we ensure that there is no discrimination in this selection?\n  Why should we not institute price control mechanisms for Internet access to ensure that rates are not increased six times?\n  It was reported that Ogle, a video streaming site backed by former Rajya Sabha MP Pritish Nandy’s Pritish Nandy Communications, was being throttled and slowed down by Airtel. How can we prevent throttling of content?\n  Measurement Lab (M-Lab) reported in 2012 that Airtel and other ISPs had been throttling BitTorrent traffic in India (read here). Does this not contradict Airtel’s pledge (point 5) about having never done this?\n  If Airtel supports Net Neutrality, and had said in its pledge that they’ve never done fast lanes, how is it that their broadband “Games on Demand” service automatically upgraded to 2 Mbps, which is a fast lane?\n  Should a moratorium be placed to prevent any violations of net neutrality, such as Internet.org and Airtel Zero, till the consultation process is on, or a definite law is framed?\n  How will licensing of Whatsapp, Viber etc help reduce the regulatory burden on telecom companies?

I might edit this later with more details.\n###tl;dr It\u0026rsquo;s not over yet. TRAI process is paused, DoT report looks very worrying, Standing Committee process is on, Digital India makes no mention of Net Neutrality. Given the way Net Neutrality has been defined in RS Prasad\u0026rsquo;s Rajya Sabha statements, it looks the definition of Net Neutrality is still open to change. We need to request standing committee MPs to support Net Neutrality. We also need support across political parties, and to attend the TRAI open house sessions when they happen. We need to get industry to push for Net Neutrality too.\n  TRAI process:\nThe TRAI currently doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a Chairman, so everything appears to be stalled until one is appointed. After the comments were submitted, most via savetheinternet.in, and I guess many by redditors, counter comments were submitted. Some of us, including me (for Medianama) and the team at Savetheinternet.in chose to submit in the counter comment stage. We decided to file separate comments, and urged everyone to file individually as well.\n All countercomments are here: http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/ConsultationPaper/Document/201505110908380696878CComments20150508.pdf Savetheinternet.in countercomments: http://www.trai.gov.in/Comments/cc/SaveTheInternet.in.pdf MediaNama countercomments: http://www.trai.gov.in/Comments/cc/MediaNama.pdf We have some kind of a listing here, and I\u0026rsquo;m yet to do an assessment of the filings: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UMbst1oi7wrzMQfb98oyiPEmZn9sl1NjdTm9XXmHKqw/edit#gid=0    DoT process:\nWe deposed before the DoT. My submission was similar to that of the submission to TRAI above, which is the basis of most of my submissions. The DoT meeting had gone of well, and the DoT subcommittee seemed very keen on Net Neutrality, but appeared to be particularly concerned about security.\nIt appears, from an ET Now report, that: - the DoT has favored licensing for Internet communications apps (Whatsapp, Viber etc). - Asked the TRAI to look into Zero rating. ET NOW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8V7ibiyKvA\nAn earlier mint report corroborates some of this: http://www.livemint.com/Industry/rS9rB1w36nlRnuCFQ8xKKM/DoT-panel-says-zerorating-plan-does-not-violate-Net-neutral.html\n  Parliamentary Standing Committee:\nWas constituted in January, and has held meetings with the TRAI and DoT for an initial briefing, with the telecom operators and with civil society. The meetings with the telecom operators were held twice because of how late the telecom operator submissions were given to the MPs (giving them less time to prepare), and only Airtel, Idea and Voda had been called. http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lk-advani-opposes-modi-government-at-key-net-neutrality-meeting-oppn-stalls-gathering/article1-1349778.aspx\nThe rumor about the subsequent meeting with the telcos is that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t very easy for them.\nWe cannot disclose anything about the meeting, since the proceedings are confidential until the report comes out, and our disclosing information would mean that we can be prosecuted. Was surprised to find an Indian Express report, but we cannot confirm or deny this: http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/net-neutrality-campaigners-slam-telecom-cos-at-panel-meeting/\n  Digital India \u0026amp; Parliament:\nThe Government\u0026rsquo;s Digital India campaign, announced yesterday, had notably no mention of Net Neutrality, and a significant focus on cyber security. It also had the telecom CEOs promising to invest in Digital India. To me, this means two things: whenever cyber security comes us, there\u0026rsquo;s talk of licensing. Whenever there is a focus on access with the telcos, there\u0026rsquo;s a push for Zero Rating.\nIn the discussion in Parliament last month, we saw statements from multiple MPs and the telecom minister. Most of the MPs supported Net Neutrality: http://www.medianama.com/2015/05/223-what-mps-said-on-net-neutrality-in-the-rajya-sabha-today/\nThe telecom minister too supported Net Neutrality, but his definition of Net Neutrality can be read either as a support for increasing access or as support for Net Neutrality (without discriminating between service providers):\n \u0026ldquo;This government is committed to the fundamental principles and concept of Net Neutrality. That is, keep the Internet available \u0026amp; accessible to all without discrimination.\u0026rdquo; http://www.medianama.com/2015/05/223-what-ravi-shankar-prasad-said-about-net-neutrality-in-rajya-sabha-today/\n   Internet industry support: Has largely been absent. They won\u0026rsquo;t really care until it hits them, or they\u0026rsquo;ve assumed that we\u0026rsquo;ve won. In fact, you might remember Flipkart saying that they will form a coalition to support Net Neutrality, along with Cleartrip, Housing and Paytm. I\u0026rsquo;ve reached out to Flipkart on a number of occasions, spoken to company representatives, but there has been zero action (heh) from them since then.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget that if Licensing happens or Zero rating goes through, the bigger companies will have a competitive advantage over smaller ones. From a purely business perspective, they would like this. Only those who take an ecosystem POV will be against Net Neutrality and be against Zero rating.\n  What can we do?   DoT process: The report isn\u0026rsquo;t public yet, and hell, we don\u0026rsquo;t even know if it\u0026rsquo;s finalized. The initial draft is worrying, but if we have enough support asking the minister to not license apps and not do zero rating, he might take that into consideration since he is the final word on this, unless the PM steps in. Tweet to them (@rsprasad, @narendramodi), Facebook to them, let them know what you think.\n  TRAI process: We don\u0026rsquo;t know, but this is likely to be the slowest of the three, but when it happens, those of you who wrote to the TRAI might want to request permission to attend the TRAI open house and make your voices heard. I\u0026rsquo;ve attended many of these, and it is usually telcos there.\n  Standing Committee: This is the most important committee right now. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of MPs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZrq0GzfTLmU7jcigDPkBsQ43DQ9QI92P9TfqHPvwvI/edit#gid=0 you may write to them asking them to support Net Neutrality. The Chairman, Anurag Thakur (@ianuragthakur), is the man at the helm of this standing committee.\n  Parliament: Resumes on the 22nd or 23rd (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which day), but it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely it will continue, given Lalitgate and the land acquisition bill. So far, every party has had MPs supporting Net Neutrality, including Tarun Vijay from the BJP who called for an Internet bill of Rights. We need more support from MPs, especially from those in the BJP, and above all from the PM and the telecom minister.\nOur two old lists: Tell Indian politicians to support Net Neutrality: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hFECFTMB5sqQVrAqSgdQQ4N9rFxY6-TwzkimhSTOKIw/edit#gid=0 (also at tinyurl . com/INDIAmpsgovt)\nTell Lok Sabha members to support Net Neutrality: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dd_SfxIpsl1Uf4yGPBcC2ogyWDV2G2tfccZwb786j9o/edit#gid=1838261279 (also at tinyurl . com/Indiampemail)\n  Industry: tell Indian startups to get more involved and fight against licensing and support Net Neutrality: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ktlZJsQejKfZwZalsUxzGfP-zdnmhc0huvJCMPlHPB0/edit#gid=0 (also at tinyurl . com/INDIAstartups)\n  We\u0026rsquo;re also trying to reach out to MPs to try and convince them, actually meeting them. We\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of running around over the past two months, trying to collect information, write submissions, and convince people one by one. The telcos and facebook, from what we\u0026rsquo;ve heard, have already met lots of MPs. The COAI even sent them letters with their point of view.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/status-update-july-2nd-2015/","summary":"Hi, just thought I\u0026rsquo;d give you guys a lowdown on where we are with the Net Neutrality battle in India.

On that open Internet, all content, applications and services are treated equally, without any discrimination. We are especially concerned that access for impoverished people is construed as justification for violations of net neutrality.\nIt is our belief that Facebook is improperly defining net neutrality in public statements and building a walled garden in which the world\u0026rsquo;s poorest people will only be able to access a limited set of insecure websites and services. Further, we are deeply concerned that Internet.org has been misleadingly marketed as providing access to the full Internet, when in fact it only provides access to a limited number of Internet-connected services that are approved by Facebook and local ISPs. In its present conception, Internet.org thereby violates the principles of net neutrality, threatening freedom of expression, equality of opportunity, security, privacy and innovation.\nWe support the goal of bringing affordable Internet access to the two-thirds of the world who currently lack it. Many of us have been working for years on initiatives to bridge the digital divide, such as building Internet access facilities in public libraries and telecentres, supporting community broadband, local telecom ventures, public investment in broadband infrastructure, making websites and services more accessible to people with feature-phones and more. We have always sought to provide non-discriminatory access to the full open Internet, without privileging certain applications or services over others and without compromising the privacy and security of users.\nInternet.org appears to be taking another route.\nIn a May 4 video, you announced new rules pertaining to Internet.org and argued that net neutrality and Internet.org are not in conflict. However, on the accompanying website, the new rules explicitly state that \u0026ldquo;websites must be properly integrated with Internet.org to allow zero rating.\u0026rdquo;\nBelow we articulate our concerns about the current structure and implementation of Internet.org:\nNet neutrality: Net neutrality supports freedom of expression and equality of opportunity by enabling people to seek, receive and impart information, and to interact as equals. It requires that the internet be maintained as an open platform on which network providers treat all content, applications and services equally, without discrimination. An important aspect of net neutrality states that everyone should be able to innovate without permission from anyone or any entity. We urge Facebook to assert its support for a true definition of net neutrality in which all applications and services are treated equally and without discrimination — especially in the majority world, where the next three billion Internet users are coming online — and to address the significant privacy and security flaws inherent in the current iteration of Internet.org.\nZero rating: Zero rating is the practice by service providers of offering their customers a specific set of services or applications that are free to use without a data plan, or that do not count against existing data caps. This practice is inherently discriminatory — which is why it has been banned or restricted in countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Chile. Zero rating is currently Internet.org\u0026rsquo;s basic model: Facebook is partnering with ISPs around the world to offer access to certain Internet applications to users at no cost. These agreements endanger freedom of expression and equality of opportunity by letting service providers decide which Internet services will be privileged over others, thus interfering with the free flow of information and people\u0026rsquo;s rights vis-a-vis networks.\nNomenclature: Internet.org misleadingly labels zero-rated applications the \u0026ldquo;Internet,\u0026rdquo; when in fact users only receive access to a tiny portion of it. The project acts as a \u0026ldquo;walled garden\u0026rdquo; in which some services are favored over others — again, a violation of net neutrality. Freedom of expression: The project raises other freedom of expression risks. The censorship capability of Internet gateways is well established — some governments require ISPs to block access to sites or services. Facebook appears to be putting itself in a position whereby governments could apply pressure to block certain content, or even, if users must log in for access, block individual users. Facebook would find itself mediating the real surveillance and censorship threats to politically active users in restrictive environments. The company should not take on this added responsibility and risk by creating a single centralized checkpoint for the free flow of information. Privacy: We are very concerned about the privacy implications of Internet.org.Facebook’s privacy policy does not provide adequate protections for new Internet users, some of whom may not understand how their data will be used, or may not be able to properly give consent for certain practices. Given the lack of statements to the contrary, it is likely Internet.org collects user data via apps and services. There is a lack of transparency about how that data is used by Internet.org and its telco partners. Internet.org also provides only a handful of applications and services, making it easier for governments and malicious actors to surveil user traffic. Security: The current implementation of Internet.org threatens the security of users. The May 4 update to the program prohibits the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or HTTPS encryption by participating services. This inherently puts users at risk, because their web traffic will be vulnerable to malicious attacks and government eavesdropping. Two-tiered Internet: The economic boom and revolution in connectivity that the Internet created in developed countries needs to be shared equally with the next three billion people. Internet.org’s model — giving users a taste of connectivity before prompting them to purchase pricey data plans — fails to acknowledge the economic reality for millions of people who can’t afford those plans. These new users could get stuck on a separate and unequal path to Internet connectivity, which will serve to widen — not narrow — the digital divide. Facebook, in its stated intentions to connect billions to the Internet, should strongly support and advocate for safeguarding the principle of net neutrality, privacy, security and other user rights in its discussions with national governments and regulators, while also applying these standards to its business initiatives.\nSigned,\n18MillionRising.org - US Access - Global Ageia Densi Colombia - Colombia Baaroo Foundation - Netherlands Bits of Freedom - Netherlands Center for Media Justice - US Centre Africain D\u0026rsquo;Echange Culturel (CAFEC) - Democratic Republic of Congo Coding Rights - Brazil Coletivo Intervozes - Brazil Colnodo - Colombia ColorofChange.org - US Community Informatics Network - Global Data Roads Foundation - Global Digital Rights Foundation - Pakistan Digitale Gesellschaft - Germany European Digital Rights (EDRi) - EU Fight for the Future - US Förderverein freie Netzwerke e.V. / freifunk.net - Germany Free Press Unlimited - EU Fundacion Karisma - Colombia Fundacion para la Libertad de Prensa - Colombia Future of Music Coalition - US Global Voices Advocacy - Global Greenhost - Netherlands i freedom Uganda - Uganda ICT Watch - Indonesia - Indonesia Initiative für Netzfreiheit - Austria Instituto Bem Estar Brasil - Brazil Instituto Beta para Internet e Democracia - IBIDEM - Brazil Instituto NUPEF - Brazil Integrating Livelihoods through Communication Information Technology for Africa - Uganda International Modern Media Institute - Iceland Internet Policy Observatory Pakistan - Pakistan IPANDETEC - Panama IT for Change - India IT-Pol Denmark - Denmark Just Associates Southern Africa - Africa KICTANet - Kenya Korean Progressive Network Jinbonet - South Korea Media Alliance - US Media Matters for Democracy (Pakistan) - Pakistan Media Mobilizing Project - US MediaNama - India Movimento Mega - Brazil Open Wireless Network of Slovenia - Slovenia OpenMedia - Global Paradigm Initiative Nigeria - Nigeria Popular Resistance - US Protege Qv - Cameroon Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales (R3D) - Mexico RedPaTodos - Colombia RIght 2 Know Campaign - South Africa RootsAction.org - US Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy \u0026amp; Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC) - Canada SavetheInternet.in - India Savvy System Designs - US Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network/Safenet - Southeast Asia TEDIC - Paraguay The Agency League of Musicians - US The Heliopolis Institute - Egypt The Media Consortium - US Unwanted Witness - Uganda Usuarios Digitales - Ecuador Vrijschrift - Netherlands WITNESS - Global xnet - Spain Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum - Zimbabwe\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/open-letter-to-mark-zuckerberg-regarding-internet-org-net-neutrality-privacy-and-security/","summary":"Savetheinternet.in has signed this open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, from digital rights organizations and groups from across the world:\nDear Mark Zuckerberg,\nWe, the undersigned, share a common concern about the launch and expansion of Facebook’s Internet.org platform and its implications for the open Internet around the world.

These press reports state that INIEWA shares the goal of various internet users in India to safeguard net neutrality. The notice mentions that failing action, INIEWA will approach court.\nWhile we, at Savetheinternet.in, believe that there shouldn’t be licensing of internet platforms and that we need legal regulations to ensure Net Neutrality, we also believe that this isn’t the right time to approach court for protecting Net Neutrality, for the following reasons:\n  We believe that the processes currently underway - TRAI and DoT consultation process and the consultation with the Standing Committee on Information Technology (2014-15) - must be respected, and should be allowed to proceed. We believe that these processes will lead to the passage of clear legislation in Parliament, and are the appropriate means for upholding net neutrality.\n  There are high chances that approaching court will not provide the right results given the absence of a clear legal regulation in favour of net neutrality. There is a need for speedy introduction of net neutrality regulation/legislation, and in the meantime a moratorium on violations.\n  There is every chance that filing a petition at this point and engaging the judicial process is likely to delay, rather than speed up, this process. There is a significant danger that it will cause the regulators to adopt a wait-and-watch approach. The need of the hour is to have a policy clearly defining the do’s and dont’s with respect to net neutrality. Again, this can only happen through a clearly defined law rather than risking the entire net neutrality campaign through litigation.\n  The adversarial process also pits DoT and TRAI against those working for net neutrality, including us. This is highly counterproductive. We do not see the government and regulatory bodies as our adversaries — on the contrary, we see them as partners in the fight to preserve consumer interest.\n  A dismissal may at this point may be cited by Telecom Operators and ISP’s in the ongoing consultations as support for their propositions.\nWe hope the reasons stated above are considered by INIEWA and Mr. Bajaj. Approaching court may be premature and will likely harm the cause of Net Neutrality in India.\nSome members of SavetheInternet.in have dealt with similar situations in the past and when all else fails, have as lawyers assisted parties to approach court. It is on the basis of experience and a hope for a clear network neutrality law we appeal to Mr. Bajaj to reconsider filing a case against the DoT.

While over 10 lakh individuals have written to TRAI favouring Net Neutrality, the operators have compared this massive response with something akin to a mob, asking the TRAI to decide the issue based on their own responses rather than going by those 10 lakh emails.\nThis debate is not really being carried out in a way it should be. The right debate should be a series of arguments and counterarguments from all sides. I see a potential risk that while TRAI will have the arguments from the operators side, as they are so few in numbers, TRAI may not cull out the counterarguments given by the 10 lakh users. To make the debate logical, I attempt to lay down a few basic starting points. All sides need to agree at least on a few common starting points, and then they could have different views, which in turn can be debated.\nHere I point out that the terms \u0026ldquo;Internet\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Net Neutrality\u0026rdquo; need to be defined and agreed upon at least for the benefit of non-technical common users, media and the government officials such as those in TRAI.\nInternet: Internet is a well defined, single, global network of computers. These computers range from humble smart phones to massive servers. Internet operates on a key defining protocol called \u0026lsquo;Internet Protocol\u0026rsquo; (or IP) which states that all computers on internet are identified with their IP addresses (they often look like 104.28.19.166). IP takes the data in the form of packets (or bunches of data bytes) and describes how the packets are routed from one IP address to another. The data packet could be carrying part of an email, a web page, a video, an audio clip, a number, a form response,\u0026hellip; The content of the data packets are immaterial to the IP. The purpose of the internet is to simply carry data from one computer to another using the Internet Protocol.\nInternet Service Provider (ISP): There is only one, global internet. The job of an ISP is to link its customers with that internet, using the globally standardised IP as the protocol. Internet service is provided under license (the ISP license) in India. The mobile telecom operators have this license but so do many others including landline telecom companies and even non-telecom companies.\nIt is easy to see that just as the internet doesn\u0026rsquo;t care what data its protocols are carrying, the ISPs too should not care what data their networks carry. Rarely, the law could require the ISP to block access to certain IP addresses, but even that doesn\u0026rsquo;t give them the right to try and decipher the users' data.\nYet, that has not stopped a few ISPs, especially the mobile operators, to deploy certain specialised tools that attempt to read the users' data packets. While often these tools are not able to decrypt the users' data, based on certain patterns they attempt to find out the type of data the packets might be carrying, such as voice, text, images, etc. Those patterns are proprietary to the tool vendors and their accuracy in being able to identify the packets is doubtful. The internet standards certainly do not specify any way to identify the packets. It is quite possible, for example, for a tool deployed by Airtel to identify a video stream data as VOIP data.\nThe mobile operators are also trying to confuse TRAI and the public when they equate their voice services with the likes of Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, etc. It is important for the public, media and especially the regulators to understand that unlike the operators these applications are not the ISPs or carriers. They run at the computers and use the already licensed internet to transmit their packets. These services are not free to the users. They consume data and the users pay to their ISPs for that data.\nNet Neutrality: Obviously, internet, linking billions of computers, is not a trivial platform. It is an outstanding result of an immense amount of effort from thousands of engineers from several countries. It was no exaggeration when the telecom minister Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad referred to internet as one of the finest creations of human mind.\nAlthough Net Neutrality is not a recognised legal principle in India, Net Neutrality is a powerful engineering principle that lies at its core. Without such engineering, internet could not have grown into such a stellar platform that it is today. In my words, I identify some of the following attributes of Net Neutrality:\n Any computer on internet should be able to communicate with any other computer on internet over IP, except for rare occasional legal restrictions. The physical or geographical location of the servers on internet is immaterial. Internet should be agnostic of the higher layers, that is, the applications generating the data packets are immaterial for internet and it does not give preference to one over the other. Internet transmits data packets equally irrespective of the manufacturer of various equipment and computers or the companies or the individuals who develop the applications as long as everyone follows the defined standards.  These defined standards are crucial for the success of internet. Net Neutrality is about preserving of these open engineering principles that has made it so successful.\nThe proponents of Net Neutrality must force the TRAI to list down the arguments and counterarguments based on facts. Media too should take a moment to understand what is internet, what makes it successful, what is net neutrality and why it is so crucial when it reports.\nThe government and the regulators now need to only make up for the missing link and recognise the neutrality of engineering principles underlying the internet as a law so that the ISPs cannot tinker with internet as they choose to in their own pecuniary interests. The ISPs are licensed to provide \u0026ldquo;internet\u0026rdquo; service, not some arbitrary variant of internet that suits their individual interest. The Net Neutrality regulation must preserve and aid the engineering of internet that has made it so successful rather than try to undermine it.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/the-basics-of-net-neutrality/","summary":"The debate on net neutrality is at its fiercest these days.

By sheer numbers, this is an unprecedented level of public participation in any regulatory consultation in India’s history.\nIn addition, everyday Internet users, hundreds of business leaders, artists and film personalities, political leaders, entrepreneurs and technologists have joined the discourse on the need to prevent Internet licensing and ensure rules to protect network neutrality. Such a cross section of society has rarely found reason to unite on complex issues of telecommunications and Internet regulation. In a way, every person today to some degree is invested in the effort to protect network neutrality.\nThe draft responses published on savetheinternet.in, ask TRAI for the following:\n No licensing of Internet content and communication apps and sites Legitimate and transparent network management without paid prioritisation to ensure stability of the network. A legal framework to protect Net Neutrality in India, to: prevent predatory practices from telecom operators and Internet companies via paid discrimination between services, which restricts consumer choice in the long run; address ‘zero rating’, which creates hurdles for new enterprises, reducing innovation \u0026amp; tech advancements.  On reaching the milestone, the volunteer group requests that in the absence of a recommendation from TRAI and any decision from the government, telecom companies be restricted from rolling out any plans and services which violate Net Neutrality, with prioritisation not pertaining to network management. The group also requests support from across political parties for an issue that impacts both the freedom of access to the Internet for all Indian citizens, and the survival of thousands of Internet-enabled Indian startups trying to Make In India.\nNotes about the SavetheInternet.in platform and submissions to TRAI:\n The number of responses sent via savetheinternet.in could be higher than 1 million, since the savetheinternet.in platform counts only those submissions that are copied to its email addresses. Users have the ability to edit the template of responses to the TRAI and substitute them with their own. This process meets both the goals of adequate notice to a user as well as providing them the choice to change the answers which have been made by a group of expert volunteers. This process is novel and not been attempted in the past. It leverages the Internet to further participative democracy: each individual has the ability to make a unique representation to the government. The march towards one million is publicly documented through the twitter handle @bulletinbabu. The movement on Net Neutrality started on March 27, 2015, after a consultation paper from TRAI invited comments on the licensing of internet companies and the viability of network neutrality oversight in India.The consultation paper runs to 118 pages and contains several proposals which pose an existential threat to the way the Internet is accessed in India for each individual user. Realising the dangers of the licensing of internet services and the absence of network neutrality regulation, the SaveTheInternet.in campaign was formed after an open call for volunteers. The goal here was not only to petition TRAI but to educate and inform everyday users disconnected with regulatory consultation processes and involve them in the formation of public policy. Towards this, the coalition abridged the 118-page-long TRAI paper to a 24-page summary (read) along with a Frequently Asked Questions guide (read), set up in the first week of April. Both were created via an online collaborative process, and released on netneutrality.in, which now hosts detailed resources for users to read and form a position, as well as a set of other ways in which they can support the cause (eg.:reach out to parliamentarians asking for their support). On April 11, 2015, the coalition launched savetheinternet.in, which hosts a simple process for individuals to reach and to submit their views to the TRAI. In less than two weeks, more than a million people across India have used it to send in submissions. Realising the long-term impact violating net neutrality creates on competition and innovation, respected Indian brands like Flipkart, Cleartrip, Times Internet and NDTV have disassociated themselves from ‘zero rating’ efforts from Airtel and Facebook. SavetheInternet.in’s volunteers include concerned individuals from different walks of life: journalists, engineers, artists, web developers, policy experts, entrepreneurs and lawyers from across India. Some have been publicly vocal about their concerns; others have contributed anonymously. Political leaders, business leaders, film stars, artists and citizens across the spectrum have come out in support of net neutrality.

There is no move to disallow telecom operators and ISPs from selling higher or slower speed packs to consumers. There is a request, however, to prevent predatory practices from telecom operators via paid discrimination between the services that consumers access on the Internet, which would, in turn influence consumer choice.\nThere is also an issue of cross-media ownership wherein telecom operators like Airtel can launch music services like Wynk, by virtue of their ownership of both content and carriage, and advantage themselves by only allowing their applications to offer free data bundled with the service, or launch service after service to compete with other online services, in order to force competition to buy free data from them, to address a disproportionate competitive advantage.\nThere is also a mention of IPTV and the need for end-to-end connectivity in the opinion piece, and hence the mention of requirement of flexibility.

Question: How will it impact me as a user? Question:But what’s wrong with Facebook’s Internet.org? Why can’t people get free Internet if they want it? Question: So I’ll only use home, office or public WiFi/Broadband. Or mostly Question: The TRAI won’t let this happen. Aren’t they supposed to protect consumer interest? Question: Yeah, but the TRAI still protects consumer/public interest, no? How will it impact me as a startup?  The Difficult Questions  Question: What is the rationale for not letting telcos use their pipes to maximize their business goals. If Levers can sell the same shampoo for different prices in different markets; or if Medianama can have different rates for different advertisers. (Alok Mittal on Facebook) Question: Does charging all Internet companies 50 paise/GB to boost investment in internet infrastructure violate net neutrality? Question: Carriage fees are norm in cable why not apply that to telecom? (source) Question: Net Neutrality-\u0026gt; Higher prices-\u0026gt; slower adoption of mobile internet! (source) Question: What is legal definition of net neutrality and what should be role of TRAI/ govt in your view because we know government intervention can have serious negative effects? Question: Which countries have a good model to deal with this? Question: Government maximises revenues when it auctions spectrum, what’s wrong in telecom companies trying to do the same? Internet is not a public utility, American courts have in the past struck down FCC regulation on Internet companies saying the same. Question: One of the arguments that has surfaced is that differential pricing is necessary for telcos to recover the high costs they bear during spectrum auctions and also to improve their networks. Without differential pricing and revenue sharing, there is no apparent incentive for telcos to upgrade their networks. What\u0026rsquo;s your response to that? Question: Could TRAI and Telecom Operators already have a deal? (source) Question: You say telecom companies will abuse net neutrality due to lack of competition and cartelisation, but govt enforced rules may lead to underinvestment in infrastructure, lack of innovation. Doesn’t lack of competition theory apply there too, which will further decrease network quality? Question: Why don’t you trust telecoms to maintain current scenario voluntarily? Question: But airtel backed off due to consumer backlash, isn’t that best kind of market regulating itself? I think market forces won’t let abuse of net neutrality work. Question: If the business of companies like Whatsapp, Google and Facebook, is in danger then why are they not coming out fully in support of Net Neutrality? Question: I already buy multiple prepaid packs. How is this different? I\u0026rsquo;m confused and need more simple references. Question: Anyone worried about security/privacy? Aren\u0026rsquo;t the TSPs looking at every bits of data consumed now and hence are working hard to get the most-used data packets turned into add-on packs? Question: Great! I want to support Net Neutrality. I want to send a mail to TRAI. Can I copy and paste a standard reply? Question: Can ISPs block any site without a government order? Question: Is there some info-graphic that I can share with my peers on social media to make them aware of the importance of Net Neutrality. Question: Electricity companies already charge based on usage. Above a limit, you are charged differentially, so why should telcos not charge differentially? Question: Telephone companies are not doing charity, they need to make money. If they are losing revenue because of WhatsApp and other services, isn’t it fair if they charge WhatsApp and others or charge us for different apps? Question: Apart from spreading awareness (by posting status messages/pictures) and mailing the TRAI, what are the other things that users can do to pressurise the government to let the internet remain the way it is? Question: Is there a way for us to send physical mailers into the TRAI, PMO office? Question: Can you help us draft something? Question: What steps the Indian startups are taking to make their voices heard? Are they supporting #NetNeutrality or are still not taking out their cards? Now that we have a list of startups, can we note down their views? Question: What is the reaction of the media? Are they concerned or still not taking sides?  The Easy Questions Question: What is going on? Answer: India’s telecom regulator TRAI has begun a consultation process (read) to decide three things:\n Should there be licensing of Whatsapp, WeChat, Ola, Uber, Line, Viber, Hike, Skype (communication Internet companies), and Flipkart, Snapdeal, Paytm, Saavn, Gaana, YouTube, Redbus, Naukri, Makemytrip (non-communication Internet companies ) in India or not? Should there be licensing for only communication Internet companies, but not for non-communication? Should telecom operators in India (Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, Uninor, Reliance Communications, Reliance Jio) be allowed to do “traffic shaping” and use differential pricing:  Slow down some sites/apps and speed up others Make some sites/apps/types of services more expensive, some sites/apps/types of services cheaper. Slice up the Internet into packs, so that instead of buying as per kb or mb, you are buying, say, a Whatsapp pack, a Twitter pack, a Flipkart pack. Create gateways so you get only some part of the Internet.    Question: How will it impact me as a user? Answer:\n  If there is licensing of Internet companies:\n If it had been there a few years ago, Whatsapp would not have been available in India unless they bought a license from the Indian government. The next big thing to come out globally (or even the little sites and services only you and a few others know and love), would have to buy a license to be made available in India. @NeutralWeb: The UAE has already banned Whatsapp Voice. (link) The next great idea from an Indian startup will not be available to you: it would be available to the rest of the world first, and then later in India if the government gives them a license. You might have to buy a separate packs for different licensed apps or services.    If there is licensing of communications services only:\n If Whatsapp refuses to buy a license, it will not be available in India. If Paytm or Quikr don’t buy a license, then you, as a buyer, will not be able to chat with a merchant via their platform. If Goqii doesn’t buy a license, then you won’t be able to chat with a fitness trainer via their app. If Facebook doesn’t buy a license, then Facebook might be available, but Facebook Messenger will not. Anything that uses messaging and voice will need to buy a license, or the Indian government will block it.  Anonymous Commenter: Should apps, whose main function is not communication, be allowed to bundle communication functionality inside them? TRAI views Ola and Uber as messaging apps with geolocation. Seriously. Read 3.1.1 here. Maybe they’re right: you are messaging a driver. They’ll need to buy a license.    If there is traffic shaping:\n  If there is speed discrimination: Telecom operators complain about how much bandwidth video takes up. So they might slow down YouTube so that you can access other sites or get YouTube to pay them to keep the same speed or make it faster. Why should you care? Because a Spuul or an Ogle might not be able to do this (read), and might never work for you because they’ll be too slow. YouTube wins. Also, if YouTube is made faster, the rest of your connection slows down a little, because of limited bandwidth. YouTube has done deals with Airtel before (read).\n  If there is price discrimination: Did you like it when Airtel made VoIP (Skype, Viber) more expensive? Today you don’t really think about how much you pay to access a site or an app because you’re paying to access the Internet, in kb and mb. Airtel wants to change this. So a different price for shopping, maybe a different price for Flipkart and Amazon. Instead of paying a monthly fee, now you’re paying to access each service separately, not knowing how much that will cost you. Sometimes telecom operators will increase the price of video separately, sometimes they’ll increase the price of messaging. You won’t really know how much you’re paying. You’ll start using a few things less (because more expensive), and a few things more (cheaper). Some big companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter) might even pay telecom operators.   If there are gateways: You’ll get limited access to the Internet. A few sites. On Internet.org, you get Cleartrip, but not MakeMyTrip, so you can’t really compare which is cheaper. You get Cricinfo but not Cricbuzz. You get Bing but not Google Search. You get OLX but not Quikr. To use a gaming analogy: the Internet is a free roam environment. You can go wherever you want. Would you be okay with a gated experience that tells you what can and cannot use? If not, why should those people who are just coming online not get to see the full Internet, the best and the worst of it?\n    Question:But what’s wrong with Facebook’s Internet.org? Why can’t people get free Internet if they want it? Answer: You have to understand the impact it has on the Internet ecosystem, and the impact that has on your choice:\n  Internet.org isn’t free Internet. It’s free Facebook + a few sites. You get a limited experience of the Internet, and Facebook (or the telecom operators) define which sites are available on it. As explained above, you have fewer choices, and Facebook plays king-maker.\n  Facebook wants to become the gateway to the mobile web, so that you access everything via it. The more powerful Facebook becomes, the more difficult it will be for you to find things it doesn’t want to. As a publisher, Facebook reduced the reach of my news stories, trying to decide what you should see in your newsfeed, even if you like my page. If Facebook becomes the primary access point on mobile, I will have to pay them to be seen (they have a Boost Post option), or my site will die. Google is still better, because search is based on your intent: you can still randomly land on my page via search. Also read: What Facebook Doesn’t Show You.\nAnonymous Commenter: Also, Google has been sued multiple times for having manipulated search results to rank it\u0026rsquo;s own inferior content above others (read).  There are two definitions of the word free. Would you want a free (zero cost) Internet, if the Internet wasn’t free (as in freedom)?\n  Airtel did the same thing with their “One touch Internet”. If this is allowed, everyone will have their own gateway. So users will have a different list of services on Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, Tata Docomo, Uninor, MTS. Maybe even landline ISPs will do this. Maybe governments looking to offer free WiFi will do this. The Internet, when accessed from India, will never be the same again. Remember “Airtel Live”, where you got a portal with limited access? You want the Internet to be like THAT?\nAnonymous Commenter: Zero-rating is sometimes viewed as a marketing tactic used by ISPs and Internet Companies to push to users apps/services which serve vested interests or could be directly/indirectly owned by Telcos stakeholders. They basically play with consumer\u0026rsquo;s penchant for free stuff to \u0026lsquo;psychologically\u0026rsquo; reduce their choices and reduce viability chances of competing alternatives in the long run. Internet.org is viewed as strategy by Facebook to penetrate developing markets to boost user base and minimize future competition (read).  Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web wrote:\n Of course, [net neutrality] is not just about blocking and throttling. It is also about stopping ‘positive discrimination’, such as when one internet operator favours one particular service over another. If we don’t explicitly outlaw this, we hand immense power to telcos and online service operators. In effect, they can become gatekeepers — able to handpick winners and the losers in the market and to favour their own sites, services and platforms over those of others. This would crowd out competition and snuff out innovative new services before they even see the light of day.\n Question: So I’ll only use home, office or public WiFi/Broadband. Or mostly Answer: Not everyone has that option. Why shouldn’t they get access to the same Internet that you do? Secondly, once the TRAI allows this, what stops ISPs from doing the same thing? Remember this model can very truly be applied to the broadband as well. So WiFi may also have “limited connectivity” for lesser value packs, with some sites or apps blocked.\nQuestion: The TRAI won’t let this happen. Aren’t they supposed to protect consumer interest? Answer: Read the paper here (pdf), or its shortened version here (Google Doc). The paper mostly presents a telecom industry point of view. Note that the TRAI document mentions Also, the TRAI appears to have decided to do something at least, find a middle ground, which might involve some licensing or allow for some Net Neutrality violations. Quote from the consultation paper:\n 5.38 Therefore, the two extremes- strict NN and no regulation- are inherently flawed. Banning all discrimination is over-inclusive and restricts the evolution of the network. Allowing all discrimination can lead to exclusion and, effectively, make the rule against blocking meaningless. Hence, a few standards or principles such as ‘No Blocking’ and fixed QoS standards ought to be specified to respond to concerns\n This means there might be some regulation and some traffic shaping and discrimination. It just wants to figure out how much of this should be allowed.\nAlso, the TRAI mentions in the paper that this was based on a seminar held in Delhi in August 2014. I was there. Lots of Internet companies spoke up against this (we covered most of it), but their point of view is not represented in the paper.\nAlso, the TRAI Chairman said then that “Over the last 6-8 months, a number of CEOs from the telecom sectors have come and spoken to me about the impending problem of OTT.” Lobbyists from the COAI have been pushing the TRAI to do this (read). They’ve finally got this consultation out.\nQuestion: Yeah, but the TRAI still protects consumer/public interest, no? Answer: Some other statements from the consultation paper on why the Internet needs regulation, licensing and/or traffic shaping. You be the judge.\n Free speech   Yet another potentially problematic area is that users of the social media websites express opinions freely without the usual social restraint. - 3.25 (Page 53)\n Big data is bad   It is said that Big Data can even predict an individual’s future actions.

(Page 57)\n How will it impact me as a startup? Answer:Simple:\n Competition: Only the big ones with deep pockets will be able to strike deals with telcos to make themselves available on their networks. A startup by, say four college kids, who have invested their own money to build the company, will not have the wherewithal to cut deals with each and every telco. There will be no level playing field. And many genuinely innovative companies will lose out because of this. Time to market: Time to Market will greatly increase. A startup product will have to be evaluated by every Telco out there. Each will have its own complications. (Anonymous commentor) Conflict of Interest with telecom companies : How will Airtel deal with an mobile/online music streaming company which competes with its own offering Wynk. How will it deal with a messaging startup which competes with Hike, which Bharti Enterprises (Airtel’s parent company) has a stake in? How will Snapdeal be dealt with by Reliance Jio, since Reliance Industries owns Homeshop18? (Anonymous commentor) Agility: if VoIP or messaging is a different pack or price from regular Internet telephony, and a startup wants to integrate it into its offering, will it need a license from the Indian government, or a telecom operator? The telecom operators have an executive who manages “vendor relations”, called a “Supply Chain Manager”. Startups will not have the ability to chop and change and reimagine consumer experiences.  The Difficult Questions Question: What is the rationale for not letting telcos use their pipes to maximize their business goals. If Levers can sell the same shampoo for different prices in different markets; or if Medianama can have different rates for different advertisers. (Alok Mittal on Facebook) Answer:\n  Public utilities are regulated differently: Telecom operators license a public resource: spectrum. In the same way that we regulate how coal mines draw coal, or how toll booths charge cars that go through them, we have to regulate how telecom companies charge users. Levers and MediaNama are private companies, their resources and products are not public property. Differential charging is fine: heavy users (like Heavy Traffic Vehicles) are charged on the basis of their usage. That’s why you have expensive data plans and cheaper data plans. You don’t stop each car, ask where they’re going, and charge accordingly. You don’t stop each vehicle, find out the value of the goods they’re carrying, and charge accordingly. I’m all for businesses getting the freedom to do what they want, but spectrum, and hence Internet access, is licensed public property, not the private property of telecom operators. Structurally, there is also significant market concentration (a point made below). Broadband and Internet access is oligopolistic in nature, and telecom operators work like cartels. That’s why Mobile Number Portability is great, because it gives you the freedom. However, not all networks are equal, not all spectrum availability is equal. To protect consumer rights, and indeed (a point made below), the freedom to do business online, regulation has to protect neutrality online, not allow the platform to discriminate and play king-maker. (thanks to this tweet for reminding me about this point)A point made here: Levers doesn’t price shampoo differently based on whether you’re shampooing the hair or the beard.Anonymous commentator adds: You buy \u0026ldquo;Quality of Access\u0026rdquo;. But once you have access you should have the freedom to do whatever with it without further interruption, restriction, influence or coercion through unfair tactics from the \u0026ldquo;Access Provider\u0026rdquo;.There\u0026rsquo;s a question later \u0026ldquo;I already buy multiple prepaid packs. How is this different? I\u0026rsquo;m confused and need more simple references\u0026rdquo;. The answer to that can be referred here.Conclusion: You can buy a sedan, an SUV, a hatchback, a luxury car, a sports car, a truck , a bus or whatever. But once you buy that vehicle, the car maker has NO say in what, where, why, when, how you use the car.\n  Impact on the Internet ecosystem: For the growth of the Internet (the Digital India goal), you need a stable platform, and for access to be open. Startups need the stability of the knowledge that just because they launch a service, it will not be slowed down, blocked, sliced into a separate package that a user will have to buy from a telecom operator, and a big competitor like Facebook or Google will not pay off a telecom operator to make their own service free, while a startup can’t afford to make its own service for free. A level playing field. If the Internet loses this, consumers will not be able to try the latest global service just because they don’t have an interconnect or carriage agreement with an Indian telecom operator. Indian startups will switch to markets where the laws allow more freedom. I know I would, if I needed to (though, I can’t because India is my only market, and I’ve always only wanted it that way).\n  You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. (watch)\nIs this the Internet that you want? (via)\n@adityamishra: I agree that TSPs should be allowed to maximise their business goals ie Revenues, profits etc. They have a right to it as much as any business. But their right needs to stop where it infringes upon the rights of other businesses. TSPs have a right to charge more for their data service if SMS usage is going down and data usage is picking up. But why should they charge more or less for specific services?\nI think these two are two different questions and need to be discussed as such. The first one a decision internal to Telcos. They decide the price of their product. The second one is about deciding the end user pricing of someone else’s product. Why should any one market player have that power over other market players? To extend the analogy given in the question - does HUL get to control the price of shampoo sold by P\u0026amp;G? (Actually the analogy is wrong because HUL is a producer and not a distributor).\nQuestion: Does charging all Internet companies 50 paise/GB to boost investment in internet infrastructure violate net neutrality? Answer:\n@nixxin: It does. The Internet is a two sided market: on one side, you have users like you and me, and the other has Internet companies (Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Whatsapp, Twitter). We use the connection provided by telecom operators to reach the Internet services. From a revenue generation perspective, the Internet access has a mechanism similar which is one sided: we pay telecom operators to access the Internet. This allows kids in college to create apps without having to sign an agreement with a telecom operator, make money by finding buyers or users for their app. Changing that model changes the principle on which basis the Internet has operated for years, and adds a layer of bureaucracy to the whole thing. Imagine having to stand outside a telecom operator’s office, or filling up a vendor form, just to allow people to access your app or service. It’s not about Rs 0.50 per GB.\nIt’s about the principles that have allowed the Internet to flourish to be changed just because telecom operators are seeing users prefer a more open and democratic ecosystem. In telecom, you paid for how much you used, and what you use. Online, you only pay for how much you use, not what you use. Look at the vibrancy of a more open ecosystem.\nI started MediaNama in 2 weeks, and we’re now 6 years old. I paid Rs 500 to register a domain name, Rs 500 a month for hosting, and a free Wordpress blog. If I wanted to start a Mobile VAS company (ringtone, ringback tone, mobile radio etc), I would have to go to each telecom operator to give me a short code, and convince each to keep renewing it every year. Telecom operators are losing control over content because of the Internet, and the TRAI paper says that too. Also, this is like charging Hafta (their pound of flesh). As an Internet company, I’m running a shop and I have consumers. The telcos wants to charge me for the consumer using a road to come to my store?\nAnonymous commenter: Telcos should have NO control over the flow of content because they were never responsible for its creation, or of the creation tools.\nQuestion: Carriage fees are norm in cable why not apply that to telecom? (source) Answer:\n@nixxin: Carriage fees were extortion in the cable business. Because TV channels make money by advertising, DTH and cable companies refused to carry their channels without paying. The TRAI legalized this. Just because it exists in Cable doesn’t mean it should exist in the Internet space. Small startups will not be in a position to negotiate with telecom operators. (Anonymous commenter adds: That is why starting a TV channel is very costly. Otherwise, comedy groups like AIB, TVF and EIC would’ve been able to start TV channels easily.) Also TV channels require government approval. We would have never had the vibrant video ecosystem we have online if it was regulated.\nSomething like this happened in Mobile VAS (wallpapers, ringtones, hello tunes, Mobile Radio etc.). In that case, 4-5 odd companies dominated the entire Mobile VAS space and there was corruption in the telecom operator ranks because someone had the power to allow or disallow a service. Smaller companies were asked to come via them. The Internet is open, Mobile is not used to being open.\nImagine if Viber, WeChat and Line, all messaging and voice calling apps, were not available for you to try out because as a messaging service, they needed to get approval from Vodafone, Idea, Airtel, Uninor etc. The rest of the world will have it. You won’t. Like the latest movies, we would be waiting for the latest apps to be made available in India. Imagine if Flipkart had to stand in queue to get a license to sell books online before it started: that was a time when no one believed that ecommerce in India. Small startups will not be in a position to negotiate with telecom operators. would be big. Look at it now.\nQuestion: Net Neutrality-\u0026gt; Higher prices-\u0026gt; slower adoption of mobile internet! (source) Answer:\n@nixxin: Three things:\n What is the Internet you want? Do you want a limited, closed Internet where you can’t explore anything, even if it is free? Would you want a muft (zero cost) Internet if it wasn’t a mukt (as in freedom) Internet, one that allows you to explore, learn, collaborate? Do we want to give those coming online an inferior Internet? Prices will come down when there is real competition in the telecom industry. Right now, they’re all collaborating on this issue, and there is no competition. Airtel, Idea and Vodafone have 66% of the active Mobile users in India, and a majority of the Mobile Internet users. Have you seen how they raise prices together, one after the other? Mobile prices only came down when there was competition, when Tata Docomo brought in per-second-billing, because there was real competition. India has poor Internet infrastructure. It ranks 122 globally in Broadband Penetration. Connectivity sucks. If there is abundance of connectivity, prices will come down. We have no wireline internet because BSNL and MTNL haven’t been unbundled. The government doesn’t sell spectrum to increase mobile and Internet access, only to pay for its expenditure. This is why we have unreliable, crappy wireline speeds, and unreliable crappy wireless Internet.  Question: What is legal definition of net neutrality and what should be role of TRAI/ govt in your view because we know government intervention can have serious negative effects? Answer:\n@nixxin: There is no precise or universal legal definition for network neutrality internationally and it is not defined in any convention. It is most commonly identified by a set of principles which have been adopted by several countries in different ways. It is developing as an area of regulation however India with the world\u0026rsquo;s third largest base of Internet users require it urgently.\nThe Internet is built on principles of openness and freedom. At the core of this is non-discrimination at an ISP level. So, three principles of Net Neutrality which have emerged and are reflected in some foreign legislation including the most recent order of the FCC in Open Internet include:\n No discrimination in terms of speed: no throttling (slowing something down, like Comcast did with Netflix), or speeding it up (like Airtel did with YouTube). No discrimination in terms of access: no gateways like Facebook’s Internet.org, which only includes a few websites and plays kingmaker. No blocking of certain sites just because they compete with you (for example, some operator could block Saavn.com because it has its own music service… :D). No discrimination in terms of cost: access to one service should not be more expensive than another. Today, when you access something online, you don’t really think of how much it costs you to access, because it’s all the same. This means that startups compete on the basis of product, not on the basis of cost of access. If there is discrimination in terms of cost, then startups will have to queue up outside a telecom operator’s doorstep, and the telecom operator will play kingmaker. Companies with deeper pockets will pay to make their services free, and this way, kill competition because other services will be paid.  @aparatbar: Timothy Wu, Professor of Law, Columbia Law School who first coined the term, “network neutrality”, stated in his original proposal in 2002 that, “As a general description, the proposal would strike a balance: it would forbid broadband operators, absent a showing of harm, from restricting what users do with their internet connection, while giving the operator general freedom to manage bandwidth consumption and other matters of local concern.” (source)\nAnonymous Commenter: Net Neutrality concept originates from \u0026ldquo;Common Carriage / Carrier Law\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Network neutrality means applying well-established \u0026ldquo;common carrier\u0026rdquo; rules to the Internet in order to preserve its freedom and openness. Common carriage prohibits the owner of a network, that holds itself out to all-comers, from discriminating against information by halting, slowing, or otherwise tampering with the transfer of any data (except for legitimate network management purposes such as easing congestion or blocking spam).\u0026rdquo;\nQuestion: Which countries have a good model to deal with this? Answer: @aparatbar: At present several countries are models of network neutrality legislation. These are segregated on the basis of strong, moderate and proposals.\nQuestion: Government maximises revenues when it auctions spectrum, what’s wrong in telecom companies trying to do the same? Internet is not a public utility, American courts have in the past struck down FCC regulation on Internet companies saying the same. Answer:\n@nixxin: I would argue that the Internet is a public utility. Spectrum is a public resource, leased to telecom operators for a certain period of time (20 years). That doesn’t necessarily give them the right to control whether we can access some services and not others, pay more for accessing some services, not others, have some services accessed at a higher speed than others. We pay for access to certain MB or KB, and that has been the norm. Look at how it has benefited us: is there any space as open, collaborative, competitive and vibrant as the Internet? Businesses and companies are free to operate whatever services they want, reimagine consumer experiences. Features become full businesses. That freedom will get constrained by this approach to maximise revenues by restricting. Telecom operators should be seeking to maximise revenues by making us use more of the Internet. They’re slicing the pie instead of growing the pie.\nMost core services - communications, commerce - run on digital infrastructure, and it brings in competitiveness and efficiency. The moment you find that you can’t do some things, the Internet will break. For example: if there is a license for a messaging app in India, would you be able to chat with merchants on a Quikr or Paytm app to negotiate rates? If there is a separate license for video, and you don’t have one, you might download a health app that has both a trainer and exercise videos. You might not be able to interact with the trainer, or watch videos, unless you have a separate license for apps, a separate license for video and one for messaging. This will break the Internet into data packs. Don’t believe me? Read what Airtel said: “We are trying to change the vocabulary away from megabytes and gigabytes in to songs and videos” (source) and what Uninor did: here.\nAnonymous commenter: In 20 years, Internet connectivity will be a core fabric for everyday necessities of life, in the same way that electricity is part of the core fabric of everyday life.Whether it be financial inclusion, health, governance, education, entertainment, communication. When electricity was being rolled out, if we saw it as being offered differentially for different services (lower cost electricity for Reliance home appliances, less reliable connection when you use a third party electrical tool), it wouldn’t be as pervasive and reliable as it is today. The Internet is at that same crossroads, between between a tool to connect a limited subset of services, or becoming a backbone for how our country evolves, innovates, and operates for the next 50 years.\n@aparatbar: Past arguments in the United States are based on legal technicalities than the ordinary dictionary definition of, “public utility”. This question to a certain degree is moot given the reclassification of Internet and Broadband utilities have been classified as services under Title II of the Telecommunications Act bringing them under the jurisdiction of the FCC. At present the legal regulations in the US, with the issuance of the Open Internet Order on March 12, 2015 are supportive of network neutrality.\nQuestion: One of the arguments that has surfaced is that differential pricing is necessary for telcos to recover the high costs they bear during spectrum auctions and also to improve their networks. Without differential pricing and revenue sharing, there is no apparent incentive for telcos to upgrade their networks. What\u0026rsquo;s your response to that? Answer:\n@nixxin: That’s what happens in a market where there is insufficient competition. Like I said earlier, the top 3 telecom operators have 66% of the active users, the top 4 have 69%. The top three ISP’s have over 95% of the ISP market. If we had more telecom operators, more ISPs, they would be competing for our money. Telecom operators can make more money, and will make more money with data, if they focus on growing the market, not slicing the market. It’s been growing :\n(source behind paywall)\nIf that kind of growth isn’t incentive to grow networks, then I don’t know what is. India has over 200 million mobile Internet connections. Airtel’s mobile Internet base has grown 2.65 times in two years.\nAlso, are you trying to tell me they didn’t do their calculations before the auctions, as to how much they can afford? Uninor didn’t win any spectrum because it became expensive. They decided to bail. Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, Jio, Tata Tele continued. How is it the Internet’s fault?\nPoint is, they are going to be forced to improve networks because consumer demand is growing, and they are making more money. Why should the Internet industry, without whom they wouldn’t have a data business, subsidise this? Telecom operators are trying to change the way ISPs have always operated, trying to convert the Internet into a telecom service.\nQuestion: Could TRAI and Telecom Operators already have a deal? (source) Answer:\n@nixxin: The TRAI held a seminar on April 5th 2014 in Delhi, which I attended, where the Chairman Rahul Khullar said that telecom operator CEO have been meeting him often and complaining about Internet companies being valued very high, while telecom operators provide them access to consumers (in actuality, telecom operators provide consumers access to the Internet.\nAnonymous Commenter: A car maker CANNOT say that it provides shopping malls access to buyers and vice-versa. It just provides the buyers access to a \u0026ldquo;Means of Transport\u0026rdquo;.\nLots of Internet companies (Rediff, Hungama, Paytm, Google) spoke against any intention to license the Internet services there. We’ve documented it here. In the regulation paper, there is hardly any information on what Internet companies said at the seminar, only what telecom companies said.\nThe first half of the paper has a heavy slant towards telecom operators, and raises issues over which TRAI has zero jurisdiction (copyright, national security, freedom of speech). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that this battle is lost, but the TRAI has is going to find some middle ground. Internet licensing was never a part of that discussion, but has been brought in into this paper. It might be a red herring: it could be that we are glad that the TRAI doesn’t have licensing for the Internet, but allows telecom operators to violate net neutrality by allowing toll-boothing, traffic shaping, zero rating etc. (explained here) Or it might be that Internet companies are okay with Whatsapp, Viber and other communications services being licensed, but not ecommerce or publishing. Either way, the Internet will not remain the way it currently is. There can and should be no middle ground, in my opinion.\nQuestion: You say telecom companies will abuse net neutrality due to lack of competition and cartelisation, but govt enforced rules may lead to underinvestment in infrastructure, lack of innovation. Doesn’t lack of competition theory apply there too, which will further decrease network quality? Answer:\n@nixxin: Not sure of how lack of competition applies here, and if there is a cartel in operation, the government needs to step in and break cartels. We haven’t seen less investment in infrastructure in the current scenario, and that is the scenario we want to retain.\nQuestion: Why don’t you trust telecoms to maintain current scenario voluntarily? Answer:\n@nixxin: We can’t trust telecom operators to retain current scenario voluntarily because of what they have said and done. Reliance Communications and Facebook have partnered to offer a gated Internet with Internet.org. RCOM and Twitter, Airtel and Google. Airtel tried differential pricing for VoIP. Check what they have been saying here and here.\nQuestion: But airtel backed off due to consumer backlash, isn’t that best kind of market regulating itself? I think market forces won’t let abuse of net neutrality work. Answer:\n@nixxin: Read Airtel’s statement. It said it backed off because the TRAI said it would do a consultation, like it has. The market didn’t regulate Airtel. They got what they wanted: a consultation. I wrote about this here. They now want to use this consultation paper to legitimise their business model where they will charge for selected apps on a differential basis.\n@mbchandar literally airtel forced TRAI by playing a drama. now what airtel has done will soon become real if TRAI sides with telcos. airtel followed by others. Anonymous Commenter: In fact, TRAI had earlier (in Aug, 2014) rejected plans for consultation (Source)\nQuestion: If the business of companies like Whatsapp, Google and Facebook, is in danger then why are they not coming out fully in support of Net Neutrality? Answer:\n@RedditIndia: This is one of the dangers of not having Net Neutrality. Without Net Neutrality, there would be a possibility that large corporations, like Google and Facebook, can collude with Telecom Operators to stifle competition in India, a very large market for these companies, and restrain the growth of new startups who don\u0026rsquo;t have deep pockets. (Also, Google and Facebook are members of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) which counts multiple TSPs as its members, like AirTel, Vodafone, Aircel etc.)\n@nixxin: Also don’t forget that companies like Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp and Google have violated Net Neutrality in India. Twitter was free on Vodafone, Facebook as Internet.org, Whatsapp tied up with multiple telcos for Whatsapp packs, Google had data free with Android One, and a tie up with Airtel for increasing YouTube speeds during the IPL. All of this violates Net Neutrality. Having done this, can they now publicly back Net Neutrality and have the humility to admit that what they did was wrong? I doubt it.\nQuestion: I already buy multiple prepaid packs. How is this different? I\u0026rsquo;m confused and need more simple references. Answer:\n@RedditIndia\n Ist scenario: Let\u0026rsquo;s say you buy a car. You are going to visit a Mall. The road to the Mall has a speed limit of 60 km/hr. But your car maker says that you can drive at 60 km/hr only if the Mall owner pays the car maker else you drive at 30 km/hr. Then the Mall owner charges you extra for the expenditure.\n  Anonymous commenter: This increases YOUR expenditure.\n  IInd scenario: Let\u0026rsquo;s say your car has a maximum speed of 60 km/hr. Ideally, you should be able to drive at that speed all the time. You need to visit a doctor. But your car maker says that you can drive at 60 km/hr only if you visit a Shopping Center else you drive at 30 km/hr when going to a doctor. Or you pay the car maker extra every time to drive at 60 km/hr.\n  Anonymous commenter: IIIrd scenario: Assume there are 3 shopping malls (A, B, C) in a city. Shopping mall (C) is owned by the Car Maker itself.\n  The car maker allows you to go to his shopping mall for FREE. But charges you extra $ 100 to go to A and $ 200 to go to B, everytime.\n  Conclusion: You can buy a sedan, an SUV, a hatchback, a luxury car, a sports car, a truck , a bus or whatever. But once you buy that vehicle, the car maker has NO say in what, where, why, when, how you use the car.\n  You buy \u0026ldquo;Quality of Access\u0026rdquo;. But once you have access you should have the freedom to do whatever with it without further interruption from the access provider.\n Question: Anyone worried about security/privacy? Aren\u0026rsquo;t the TSPs looking at every bits of data consumed now and hence are working hard to get the most-used data packets turned into add-on packs? Answer:\n@nixxin: We are. India doesn’t have a privacy law. There’s a mandate from the government to bring location awareness down to 50 meters. There’s tracking and recording of calls, GSM sniffers (source), Social Media Monitoring via Netra), NATGRID. What’s more, there is no judicial oversight of surveillance. The Centralised Monitoring System is meant to allow governments to tap calls even without telecom operators knowing or receiving orders.\n@DekaJayanta: Let me try to answer my question. I think when the network will pay attention to the content of data rather than concentrating solely on delivering, there starts a serious problem. The Telecom Service Providers are trying to make windows for every bit of data and slab it accordingly to charge differentially. By reading the data in a packet, they are definitely breaking privacy as well.\nQuestion: Great! I want to support Net Neutrality. I want to send a mail to TRAI. Can I copy and paste a standard reply? Answer: Yes, you can do that via savetheinternet.in\nQuestion: Can ISPs block any site without a government order? Answer:\n@nixxin: The way blocking works in India, under Section 69A, blocking is secret. So, typically, without leaks, we don’t even know if the government has gotten something blocked. In case of ISPs, there is an allegation that they have blocked sites. Anonymous, a few years ago, had hacked the servers of Reliance Communications, and found a list of sites blocked, and published them on pastebin. Details here. There’s no telling whether this is true or not, but I wouldn’t say that this may not have happened.\nQuestion: Is there some info-graphic that I can share with my peers on social media to make them aware of the importance of Net Neutrality. Answer:\n@RedditIndia: Here is one info-graphic created by a redditor (source) and he/she has made it license free. You are free to use this to spread awareness. https://i.imgur.com/gazt94B.png\nAnonymous Commenter: You can also freely use these funny memes to spread the message.\nYou can also find more resources on Support Net Neutrality page.\nQuestion: Electricity companies already charge based on usage. Above a limit, you are charged differentially, so why should telcos not charge differentially? Answer:\n@ravithinkz: I think we need electricity neutrality. We should not segregate based on the type of consumption - household or industrial or agriculture, after all, what we do with our kilowatt-hour is none of their business, isn’t it?. Combine them all and charge everyone with the same unit rate and have same amount of outages.\n@DekaJayanta: The model of electricity companies charging on usage is what we look up to in case of Telecom companies as well. A 1 GB pack for the present rate is OK instead of getting charged Rs 1 per website. I can make use of that 1 GB in whichever way i want to - browsing all the \u0026ldquo;legal\u0026rdquo; websites. Electricity companies don\u0026rsquo;t ask which devices you will use with the connection. They do provide a cap - to manage load better - but they don\u0026rsquo;t charge you like say Rs 100 access fee for using AC, Rs 50 for washing machine etc. They neither charge you differently for different brands - LG refrigerator will have low electricity rates than Samsung! In this case, the telecom companies are pitching for a regulation where they would be able to: 1. Charge access fees for websites which \u0026ldquo;are harming their business\u0026rdquo;. Like preference to Hike over WhatsApp. 2. They can provide better speed to Bing rather than Google (or the other way round) and may also levy extra charges on accessing Google. 3. This will also have bigger impact on small start-ups who would be coaxed to go for deals with these telecom companies - the almost certain death of new players.\nAnonymous Commenter: Electricity Company analogy is valid only for \u0026ldquo;Price for Quality of Access\u0026rdquo;, that is the price you pay to access per unit of electricity depending on your usage band. \u0026ldquo;Price for Quality of Access\u0026rdquo; is different from how ISPs are defining it. ISPs are saying, \u0026ldquo;Pay them depending on where Internet is used, i.e., both the user and the online service used by the user should pay the ISP.\u0026rdquo; If I use a 8 Mbps internet connection with a monthly download limit of \u0026ldquo;80 GB\u0026rdquo;, obviously I will pay more than someone using 8 Mbps with a monthly download limit of \u0026ldquo;10 GB\u0026rdquo;. And also I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is a concept of \u0026ldquo;Bandwidth throttling of electricity\u0026rdquo;, which is a major concern with Internet Bandwidth throttling.\nAlso read this article by Secretary of State for European Affairs for the Portuguese government who says, \u0026ldquo;The real question is - Who gets to decide on Content?\u0026quot;\n@adityamishra The analogy is broken. Besides the excellent points made below; electricity is a regulated market. This means that the regulator fixes the price and not the electricity company. In telecom, it is the TSP that sets the price and not TRAI.\nFurthermore, the price increases with consumption bands in electricity because richer customers (ie higher consumption band) subsidises the poor customers (ie low consumption band). There is no such subsidy in telecom.\nOne can compare the electricity transmission business with Telco business in a limited way. This can be done by looking at the Fee that Reliance charges Tata Power in Mumbai for using its network. It’s flat fee per unit and does not change with consumption bands. @ankitpandey: Telecom companies already charge you based on your usage. The FUP (Fair usage policy) is exactly that, where the user is charged more if over a certain limit. However the Electric companies do not charge you for the kind of appliance you are running using that electricity. Whether you use an AC or an electric kettle or a fan, the charges remain same. THIS is what the ISPs and TelCos are trying to change with the internet.\n@chupchap: The issue is not about metered rates. The issue is when the electricity provider charges you separate rates for using a bulb and a different rate for using a bed lamp. You should be charged based on usage and not based on what the usage was for. Continuing the electricity analogy, you cannot run an industry using a home electricity connection. Similarly you cannot set up a server using your home internet. There are already checks in place to avoid abuse of the system. FUP is not part of net neutrality and that is something that will be fixed my free market over time (or at least that is the hope).\n@mbchandar i think telcos already charging differentially based on usage. remember FUP applied on broadband which is started by airtel and then everyone followed upto bsnl. what if electricity are charged based on devices - for computers, for lights, for ACs, for Water heaters, induction cookers etc each consume different power …. would you be willing to pay per device usage….. telcos suggesting of charging OTT players are like that.\nQuestion: Telephone companies are not doing charity, they need to make money. If they are losing revenue because of WhatsApp and other services, isn’t it fair if they charge WhatsApp and others or charge us for different apps? Answer:\n@adityamishra Telecom Operators have the option of increasing the price of net access across the board to make up for the lost revenue. Why should they decide what to charge for and what not to charge for?\n@chupchap: Should electricity board charge you extra if you have a solar water heater? Should you have to take permission from them to set up a solar water heater?\n@mbchandar just because telcos are losing money and hence policy has to be made for them: that idea is insane. They have to come up with new VAS. Like they did with caller tunes, ringtones, sms packs etc.\nAnonymous Commenter: Nobody is stopping Telcos from diversifying their business portfolio. Telcos can freely launch their own competing apps BUT don\u0026rsquo;t break Net Neutrality.\n@DekaJayanta: We are looking this from a very micro-level. What if Telecom Opertors say only TOI.com, Gaana.com and a few xyz.com will be available through the basic pack. And for every other bunch of websites, you need to pay (say Rs 2 per website). This sounds like a cable TV rather than internet. What if a company (TOI for an example here) strikes a deal with say Airtel. Someone willing to browse HT will have to pay an extra fee! (Example for better understanding)\nQuestion: Apart from spreading awareness (by posting status messages/pictures) and mailing the TRAI, what are the other things that users can do to pressurise the government to let the internet remain the way it is?

Are they concerned or still not taking sides? Answer: They are taking sides, and that\u0026rsquo;s their call, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s an open bias, and readers know that bias. That\u0026rsquo;s the beauty of the Internet: you\u0026rsquo;re not restricted to one point of view because you get only one newspaper or a few TV channels. The media will take its own call.

We use it to do our work, connect with people and gain knowledge.\nYou, our representatives, and your parties, also use it to gather research about the issues faced by your constituents, the challenges faced by different parts of our country, and the expert knowledge needed to legislate for India’s future and shape our national decisions. You use it to communicate directly with your supporters.\nBut today, the Internet in our country is facing the danger of losing its neutrality. Neutrality is vital to ensure that the Internet reaches many more of our fellow Indians, especially the disadvantaged, to ensure that they can gain knowledge and take advantage of is opportunities; it is also vital to those who are using the Internet to innovate and help India grow.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we, a collectve of concerned citizens, have launched a campaign with fellow Indians who wish to ‘Save the Internet’.\nSavetheInternet.in is an apolitical collective, where various individuals — journalists, engineers, artists, web developers, policy experts, lawyers — have come together in their personal capacity to voice their concerns with respect to threats to the free and open character of the Internet.\n This letter is addressed to parliamentarians who have already taken or are considering taking a position on the recent consultation paper released by the TRAI for Internet licensing and net neutrality.\nWe are grateful for the support we have received and the various public statements made by several of you which cut across party lines. Through this letter we wish to point out the intent and purpose of SavetheInternet.in campaign and the reasons for the call for a larger network neutrality law in India.\nAs of 11:30, 22 April 2015, more than 970,000 individuals have sent submissions to TRAI on the present consultation after visiting savetheinternet.in. This is an unprecedented volume of reponse to any public consultation organised by a regulator in India. It reflects public concern about the increasing threats to our Internet.\nWhat are these threats?\n Misplaced arguments calling for additional regulations (nearly a new “license permit raj”) on Internet applications and services; and The absence of any network neutrality oversight in India on telecom operators. This presents an existential threat to the way the Internet is accessed in India, by failing to provide for a system to protect the public interest.  The Internet in India is already regulated by many law; many Parliamentarians have often publicly spoken about the comprehensive provisions of the Information Technology Act; many have called for its reform in order to stop over-regulating the innovation and creativity of Indians online. Other sector-specific laws overseen by the RBI and IRDA — such as regulations about online payments, the banking industry, and insurance — already exist. Despite this clear intent by Parliament and our Government as a whole, TRAI’s current paper has called for such regressive measures as licensing Internet sites and apps. Such a proposal would not only throttle consumer choice, it will kill all innovation and hinder the rapid growth of India’s technology sector, destroying the future of tens of thousands of entrepreneurs and hardworking young IT professionals, along with . We therefore oppose any measure calling for the licensing of the Internet.\nThe second prong of the TRAI consultation revolves around network neutrality. Net neutrality requires that the Internet be maintained as an open platform, on which network providers treat all content, applications and services equally, without discrimination. This principle, which preserves the free and open character of the Internet, has been recognised by several fellow democracies, including Brazil, the United States, a number of South American countries, and has support from the European Parliament.\nThe Government of India and TRAI need to urgently commit to a policy which outlines how net neutrality will be safeguarded. Some telecom companies operating in our country are increasingly engaging in commercial and technical practices which violate network neutrality, to the detriment of consumer interest, free competition and innovation between Internet businesses. In particular, attention needs to be paid to the recent practice of “zero rating” some select services, where access to specific web sites or online applications are given for free at the discretion of the telecom operator. Several countries have chosen to carefully oversee and regulate this practice of zero rating services, or have given only case-by-case approvals to ensure that they do not skew incentives and create entry barriers for young entrepreneurs. Zero rating also affects user behaviour, destroying the free and open nature of the internet.\nIt is also surprising for us that telecom companies have shown little respect for TRAI\u0026rsquo;s consultation process; some are already rolling out and announcing such services. This is unfortunate. It appears to be with a view towards consolidating violations of network neutrality as a norm.\nWe request all parliamentarians and political parties to urgently call for a policy of forbearance on such practices enforced by TRAI while the present consultation is progressing*. Let TRAI do its job\nFinally, we urge, with the utmost humility, that — just like the Internet — the present effort should not to be appropriated by any individual, organisation or political party.\nWe are an apolitical group and do not have any party allegiances, but we are grateful at the support shown to our concerns by political leaders across India’s political spectrum. We hope the cause of a free and open Internet continues receiving support from all people committed to our democracy.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/letter-to-parliamentarians/","summary":"The Internet has become an integral part of all of our lives.

We love free stuff as much as you do. We love Wikipedia for the stupendous volume of human knowledge it is, and can only wish that everyone in the world has access to it for as low a cost as possible (all costs considered, from phone to data plan). We love our free torrents too.\nWho can hate free stuff? Why would we deny someone else getting something for free, whether it’s free data or free services?\nOur concern is with who gets to decide what you should have for free.\nWhatsApp is free. The WhatsApp folks (now part of Facebook) have figured out how to give you the service for free while thriving as a business. That’s wonderful and we love it. Skype is free too, and also thriving (now as part of Microsoft). We love that too.\nSo who is Airtel to step in between and tell you they will charge you extra for using WhatsApp or Skype? They did just this in December 2014 and your outrage prompted TRAI to step in and put out their ponderous consultation paper asking if they should formalise licensing arrangements, among other things. Your further outrage prompted this #SaveTheInternet campaign.\nWe all clearly don’t like TRAI or any telco interfering in a pricing decision between a service provider and you, so consider this further and ask why a telco is interfering again to make something free for you.\nFree stuff is great, make no mistake, but if the earlier plan was to charge you extra, what new scheme is cooking to make it free now? Are telcos doing this from the goodness of their heart, or is there an ulterior motive that we have trouble seeing because it has FREE signs plastered all over? The common arguments often advanced for zero rating schemes:\n Services like Wikipedia are free. How dare you deny anyone access to Wikipedia? (We aren’t.) Free data will spread access to the Internet. Limited access is better than no access. (We don’t disagree.)  Our question is simply this: who’s playing the gatekeeper who decides what is free and what is not, and what kind of oversight do we have on them? Gatekeeping on the internet makes one powerful, so one should be concerned the position is not abused. Is it even possible to regulate it?\nCase in point: how does Internet.org decide what sites are available for free and what aren’t? Mark Zuckerberg explained on his Facebook post that Facebook works with local governments to pick sites, but to date we have no idea what local government picked the sites that are available in India—we don’t even know which body to file an RTI request with—nor do we know what criteria was used to select them. When Cleartrip withdrew from Internet.org April 15, they said:\n But the recent debate around #NetNeutrality gave us pause to rethink our approach to Internet.org and the idea of large corporations getting involved with picking and choosing who gets access to what and how fast. What started off with providing a simple search service has us now concerned with influencing customer decision-making by forcing options on them, something that is against our core DNA.\n  So while our original intent was noble, it is impossible to pretend there is no conflict of interest (both real and perceived) in our decision to be a participant in Internet.org. In light of this, Cleartrip has withdrawn our association with and participation in Internet.org entirely.\n Internet.org’s philanthropic claims have been questioned widely:\n The Verge: How Facebook stumbled into India’s fight for net neutrality Techdirt: Facebook’s Zuckerberg Thinks Aggressively Violating Net Neutrality Is Fine\u0026hellip;If You Just Mean Well Doc Searls: Internet.org is a failed exercise in misdirection Osama Manzar: An open letter to Mark Zuckerberg on Net neutrality  Or if you think Internet.org is only for poor people and doesn’t affect you, consider Airtel Zero. Airtel wasn’t beyond some creative twisting of facts in their recent pledge, so any claims of Airtel Zero being an open platform with fair and transparent pricing deserve scrutiny. When Flipkart backed out of Airtel Zero, they said:\n We at Flipkart have always strongly believed in the concept of net neutrality, for we exist because of the Internet. Over the past few days, there has been a great amount of debate, both internally and externally, on the topic of zero rating, and we have a deeper understanding of the implications. After reviewing implications of zero rating deeply, we reached the conclusion that it doesn’t meet our standards of net neutrality and violates the principles that we stand for\n Just what did Flipkart see in Airtel Zero that bothered them so much? Here is Flipkart’s CTO Amod Malviya going into more detail. Take a moment to read it.\nStill confused? Aravind Ravi-Sulekha identified the precise issue days before media attention took off, so you likely missed this.\nAravind notes that you as a customer have a choice of which telco you want to do business with. The choice is completely yours from within the limited range of telcos and plans on offer, and telcos compete to present you the most attractive plans. Since telcos use licensed public spectrum and are effective monopolies on that slice of spectrum, limiting competition, TRAI has a job to ensure competition remains fair and free of cartelisation. (Their effectiveness at this is a different matter.)\nHowever, for app developers hoping to zero rate their apps to gain more users, there is no competitive pressure on prices. If Airtel wants Re 1 per MB for zero rating (that figure being the example from their press release), the app developer has no choice but to pay what Airtel is quoting, “fair and transparent”. There is no negotiating around this figure because there is no other way to access the telco’s users. App developers have a binary choice: pay up or drop out. As Amod notes, app developers will be compelled to pay up to compete with other apps in the same category, so it only requires one to kickstart the scheme—and Airtel has indeed done this, offering free data with their Wynk music app.\nVodafone or Idea may offer Rs 0.50 per MB to compete with Airtel, but all zero-rated plans are free for the end user, so there’s no compelling reason to switch. If users don’t switch, the lower price offer has no value for app developers. Developers have no recourse but to recommend you try their app on another telco’s network.\n(In this case, accidentally.)\nWhat can a regulator do to ensure fairness in such a situation? No one has a clear proposal.\nActual data rates today are in the range of Rs 250 per 1 GB or roughly 25 paise per MB, a quarter of Airtel’s example rate. If app developers have to pay four times what a user pays—and unlike a user have no choice—that burden will indirectly be passed back onto users, while ensuring data rates remain high. Users are now paying 4x as much for data on a purpotedly free plan, routing their money via an app developer’s pocket so the telco appears untainted.\nIn summary, we don’t hate free. We just think schemes like Internet.org and Airtel Zero are disingenious, handing power without oversight to the sort of entity that has a known history of abusing this power. Everybody deserves Wikipedia for free, but not if it destroys the Internet in the process.\nDo we have a better idea that improves internet access without potential for abuse? We don’t, which is why we are asking you to engage with the problem instead of blindly accepting the telco agenda.\nUpdate: One recurring refrain is that bandwidth-hogging apps like VoIP and video strain already scarce spectrum, so they should be regarded separately from light activities like browsing. However, a byte is a byte, no matter whether it\u0026rsquo;s a byte of video or text. Every byte strains spectrum in the same way, so the obvious solution is to charge heavy users more, and this is exactly what telcos are already doing. It’s making them a lot of money too.\n(This post may be reproduced freely under the Creative Commons Attribution CC-BY 4.0 license.)\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/why-does-savetheinternet-hate-free/","summary":"We don’t.

We are a group of volunteers. There are over 50 of us. We are apolitical and, as a collective, unaffiliated with any political party or organisation. Our belief in net neutrality is above whatever political affiliations individual members have. We are not aligned with any company, industry association or non-government organisation. We come from various backgrounds, from various parts of India, each with different skills and talents. Our collective includes geeks and enthusiasts from various fields: technology, law, journalism, design, policy. Many of us are entrepreneurs. The time we donate to the effort is personal time, and given of our own free will. Domain names and server space have been paid for by members of the collective from their personal funds. Our total expenses on the campaign are under Rs 1000. We have no external funding, and we aren’t looking for any at present.  Why we exist  We want an open Internet, where everyone has an equal opportunity to use the sites and services they want, when they want, irrespective of which provider they use to connect to the Internet. We want net neutrality to be protected in India. Net neutrality allows us to have the choice to visit and experience every site or app equally without any discrimination in terms of price, speed or availability from a telecom company. This freedom allows us to create, communicate and collaborate with people across the globe and for businesses to combine audio, video and text, and reimagine consumer experience. The TRAI consultation [PDF: 2MB], which could either lead to licensing of Internet companies or convert them into vendors of telecom operators, has us very worried about the future of the Internet in India.  What we do  We run netneutrality.in and savetheinternet.in. We educate: we create awareness about the TRAI consultation, and help people understand the nuances of issues related to net neutrality by providing data, information and opinion, answering questions and addressing misconceptions. netneutrality.in hosts links to various arguments for net neutrality, and a set of suggestions for concerned citizens on how they can participate in the effort. savetheinternet.in hosts a set of answers to the questions raised in the TRAI consultation paper. These answers were prepared by the collective, with the help of lawyers (who are part of the collective). Users are free to edit these answers to reflect their point of view, even if they disagree with ours. We don’t send answers to TRAI for them: they copy their answers to their email accounts, and send them to TRAI. As of 21 April, 17:00 hours, over 9.5 lakh emails have been sent to TRAI CCing or BCCing us. Many more may have been sent without our knowledge. The collective is also on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.  How we work  We’re in different cities. Most of us have never met each other before, online or offline. We collaborate from wherever we are, using whatever devices we have at hand, via anything from phone calls to private online chat rooms. The group is loosely organised; problems are discussed, solutions arrived at, individuals put up their hands to implement the solutions. Sometimes individuals see a problem, go off and solve it, then bring the solution to the group for discussion. We aim for rough consensus and running solutions. Of course there are arguments. Ferocious ones sometimes. Some of these have taken place in public view. We understand that we are not fighting; we’re just trying to understand differing points of view about complex subjects and come to a common ground that the collective is comfortable with. We’re all still talking to one another and will buy each other beverages if and when we do meet in person.  The story so far  Members of Reddit India began discussing Net Neutrality in December 2014, after the news of Airtel deciding to charge extra for Skype (VoIP services) use on its network. netneutrality.in was started on December 25, 2014, to talk about net neutrality and how Airtel was breaking it. A petition was started on change.org Airtel decided to reverse their decision after the issue gained public attention and TRAI agreed to bring a consultation paper, which was made public on 27 March 2015. We created an abridged version of the TRAI consultation paper. Spreadsheets which allow users to inform startups, politicians and influential Twitter users about the consultation were created. Members of Reddit India and of other forums began discussions on the topic, with members collaborating on writing answers, and answering concerns. Detailed answers using legally correct language were prepared. We launched savetheinternet.in to help concerned Indian citizens submit responses to TRAI; the answers were a result of collaboration by a group of volunteers. After an initial push by the collective, a video by the comedy collective All India Bakchod that urged viewers to go to savetheinternet.in and mail TRAI the answers there gave the movement a huge boost. Their loyal following, which includes many celebrities with massive fan followings of their own, in turn linked to the AIB video, widening the campaign’s reach. News of the Flipkart and Airtel Zero deal broke. Flipkart immediately came under harsh criticism. AIB’s video and the Flipkart news led to the media, which had already been covering the issue sporadically, moving their coverage up several notches; the #SaveTheInternet movement moved to newspaper front pages, prime time television, and online news and views sites. Simultaneously, we ran sub-campaigns to encourage founders of start-ups and internet-based businesses to declare their support for net neutrality (including some who had signed up for platforms like Airtel Zero and Facebook’s internet.org); some of these companies withdrew and publicly stated support for net neutrality (notably, Flipkart’s withdrawal from Airtel Zero made a splash). Others proclaimed support for net neutrality without joining these schemes. Cleartrip withdrew from Internet.org, making it the first blow to that scheme. Several others quickly followed. The campaign continues, and we’re now focussing on other groups of influencers. For instance, we are asking concerned citizens to contact parliamentarians and political parties across lines to encourage them to support the movement. And we are putting together an open letter from start-ups. For those who have already sent email to TRAI, and who would like to help more, we have put together a set of suggestions on other things to do to support the movement. Our immediate goal is to get at least 1 million letters to TRAI; we’re less than 45,000 away from the target.  Public support for Net Neutrality We’ve had over 2 million unique visitors to savetheinternet.in, and over 950,000 emails have been copied to us. Many activists are organising on-the-ground events in their cities to bring attention to the need for net neutrality. A host of companies and organisations have declared support for Net Neutrality, some through their official social media feeds, some with public statements from their executives or owners on web sites and to the media. So have a number of stars and celebrities. They have done so out of their own free will. We are grateful for their support, and accept it in the spirit in which we think it was given: i.e.: unconditionally.\nAll numbers and other data as of 21 April 2015, 17:00.\n","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/about-2/","summary":"Who we are  We are not a company or any kind of formal entity.

We’re addressing a few claims made in the letter here:\n  Airtel said that it is committed to Net Neutrality. However, Airtel cannot be committed to Net Neutrality while simultaneously violating it. The TRAI consultation paper (read) itself says on page 77:\n“In other words, NN implies that there cannot be any price discrimination between suppliers of content and also among the customers that access such content.”\nAnd on Page 98:\n“Airtel’s intended differential pricing for VoIP is an example of price discrimination.”\nIn the same way, differential pricing for different sites, with some sites costing Zero, and others not, is an example of a Net Neutrality violation. The TRAI says so too (read). Airtel needs to clarify how it can be committed to Net Neutrality while violating it.\n  There is something factually incorrect about the statement “No blocking, No fast lanes. Never done it. Never will. #airtelpledge”. For the Indian Premier League in 2010, Airtel had provided a fast lane to users accessing YouTube, increasing their speed to 2 Mbps. Read about it here. Two years later, the Measurement Lab (M-Lab) reported that Airtel and other ISPs had been throttling BitTorrent traffic in India for years (read). If Airtel says that it will not block and not provide fast or slow lanes in the future, then there should be a mechanism holding it accountable to that pledge.\n  Airtel Zero says that every Indian has the right to be on the Internet. We agree with that. However, Airtel Zero is not the Internet. Even if it has 10,000 websites paying Airtel, those 10,000 sites cannot replace the millions that comprise of the Internet. So, even though Airtel says that “We know that if we allow them to experience the joys of the internet, they will join the digital revolution”, we’re afraid that those users will get limited access, and every time they try and go out of Airtel Zero, they stop, because they will get a message that says that they cannot view the world wide web unless they buy a data pack. The best case scenario here is that they will be (rightly) warned that they will be charged per kb for going out of Airtel Zero. If that happens, they will be less likely to jump the fence around Airtel Zero, and experience the rest of the web. Since this would be the first time a lot of these people maybe accessing the internet, this amounts to those people being denied the knowledge of what their choices are, leave apart the right to choose.\n  We’re also concerned that Airtel Zero will slice the Internet: There might be an Idea Zero, Vodafone Zero, Aircel Zero, Uninor Zero, Tata Docomo Zero. This means that each user will get a different experience of websites, and may never know the universe outside of this collection of websites. That restricts consumer choice. Zero rating is “positive discrimination”. Tim Berners-Lee, one of the founding fathers of the Internet as we know it, wrote in February that Net Neutrality is “also about stopping \u0026lsquo;positive discrimination\u0026rsquo;, such as when one internet operator favours one particular service over another. If we don’t explicitly outlaw this, we hand immense power to telcos and online service operators.” Airtel Zero favors those services who pay them to be zero rated.\n  Airtel Zero changes the way the we access information via the Internet. The web was created as an open platform, where anyone could set up and host their site anywhere, and be available across the globe. This is why sites hosted in India are available across the globe. Websites don’t tie up with and pay each telecom operator and ISPs in each country (hundreds across the world) so that consumers can access these sites. If the next 200 million users in India are on Airtel Zero, startups and other companies will have to choose between ignoring these customers or tying up with multiple Indian telecom operators. Historically, telecom operators have co-ordinated when negotiating rates with content owners (read)\n  Airtel is incorrect when it says that Airtel Zero is like a toll free number. Here is why:\n  A toll free voice service is a support mechanism for most businesses, and not the sole entry point for the business like an app or a website. An Internet company has 100% dependency on Internet access providers and telecom providers, while that is not the case with most companies that use toll free voice services. This leaves room for potential abuse, in case of differential pricing, manipulation of access speeds, or monopolistic hiking of rates, like in case of carriage fees in Cable TV. Read what happened in Cable TV in India (here).\n  A toll free voice service isn’t the mode of delivery for the service itself: it’s a mode of information, and rarely, a mode of transaction. In case of the Internet, all delivery of content and communications takes place over the access mechanism, and all transactions take place via the access for ecommerce companies.\n  Providers of toll free voice services do not compete with their customers. However, in case of the Internet, telecom operators have launched competing services. For example, Airtel’s Wynk is a music streaming service which has plans that come bundled with free data, while, at the time of launch, its competitors did not have that option. This is a cross-media ownership issue, where the carriage mechanism also owns content, and can abuse its position of controlling access.\n  Once one startup joins, because of high dependency, competitive pressure ensures that others also join. When Flipkart allegedly joined Airtel Zero, its competitors began examining that option. Times Internet has said that most of its publication businesses will not exit Internet.org unless their competitors also do so: no one will risk being the first to leave if competing sites are around.\n    Airtel Zero is not a marketing expense, it’s an access fee. It shifts the model of the Internet from a situation where a consumer pays Airtel to access whatever she wants, with the whole Internet being accessible, to where a company pays to allow its app or service to be accessible to Zero users, and access to the rest being limited. While it may be seen as an optional marketing expense to begin with, once one company comes on board, its competitors will also be forced to join. They will be locked in. Startups that wish to compete with zero-rated companies will have to raise money separately. Today, they can choose not to spend on marketing, and student startups can grow purely on the basis of their product and consumers sharing it. In a fenced-in Airtel Zero, that virality will not exist, and it will become a compulsory cost as an access fee. Airtel Zero is not a marketing expense.\nIf companies paid the same rates as users, there would be no business model in Airtel Zero. The rates will necessarily be much higher, and companies that pay will eventually pass on the burden to consumers. Airtel Zero will increase costs for everyone with only Airtel benefitting.\nTo sum it up, Airtel Zero changes the way the Internet works by reducing consumer choice by fencing them in, making Internet companies dependent on telecom operators for discovery and access of their services. The Internet model isn’t broken, and has grown on the basis of the principles of neutrality and openness. We have no reason to change this model, and to allow telecom operators to discriminate in terms of how and what we access will end up only empowering telecom operators, not citizens. Digital India is meant to empower citizens, not telecom operators.\n  ","permalink":"https://internetfreedomfoundation.github.io/archive/post/airtelpledge/","summary":"On April 18th, Airtel sent a letter, called #airtelpledge (read), to all its employees and all its postpaid users, making some claims and promises about Airtel Zero. We’re addressing a few claims made in the letter here:\n  Airtel said that it is committed to Net Neutrality. However, Airtel cannot be committed to Net Neutrality while simultaneously violating it.
