 What are Internet Shutdowns? Internet shutdowns are an absolute restriction placed on the use of internet services due to an order issued by a government body. It may be limited to a specific place and to specific period, time or number of days. Sometimes it can even extend indefinitely. An internet shutdown may be limited to mobile internet that you use on smartphones, or the wired broadband that usually connects a desktop - or both at the same time."><meta name=author content="Aravind R S"><link rel=canonical href=https://archive.internetfreedom.in/shutdowns-faq/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.48a18943c2fc15c38a372b8dde1f5e5dc0bc64fa6cb90f5a817d2f8c76b7f3ae.css integrity="sha256-SKGJQ8L8FcOKNyuN3h9eXcC8ZPpsuQ9agX0vjHa3864=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=preload href=/iff-logo-600x250.png as=image><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.4dcb3c4f38462f66c6b6137227726f5543cb934cca9788f041c087e374491df2.js integrity="sha256-Tcs8TzhGL2bGthNyJ3JvVUPLk0zKl4jwQcCH43RJHfI=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Read more\n  What are some of the common reasons for restricting the use of the Internet? The reasons for shutting down the internet have often first been said to be to respond to concerns about law and order but they have only grown with time. Reasons for shutting down the internet now have included to ensure peace during a festival procession as well as to prevent cheating in exams.\n  The Digital Empowerment Foundation in a recent report has stated that, “[t]he reasons behind the shutdowns were not always properly described. in most cases, state governments allowed these shutdowns in the time of protests”.

Unfortunately as more of India gets connected to the Internet, the frequency and geographic extent of shutdowns are spreading. Research indicates that India ranks the highest in the number of internet shutdowns in 2016.\n  The year has barely started but as per the Centre for Communications Governance and we already have had six such incidents.

Shutting down the internet can lead to a direct harm to the economy of the country. Studies suggest that India loses at least $968 million (more than Rs.6000 crores) in a year due to internet shutdowns.
