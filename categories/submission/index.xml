      <description>In its current form, the RPP Bill is plagued by definitional confusion and lack of a clearly stated purpose. We urge the government to start from a clean slate by publishing a whitepaper and conducting public consultation.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting Indiaâ€™s WiFi</title>
      <link>https://archive.internetfreedom.in/post/troubleshooting-indias-wifi/</link>

      <guid>https://archive.internetfreedom.in/post/troubleshooting-indias-wifi/</guid>
      <description>A recently-closed consultation paper by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) explored how public WiFi could bring high-speed Internet to a large number of unconnected Indians. The Internet Freedom Foundation regards this as a very important issue and we have formally submitted our inputs to this consultation; this post explains our position.
In the consultation paper, TRAI pointed out that our country has woefully few public WiFi hotspots, even compared to other countries far smaller than ours.</description>

      <guid>https://archive.internetfreedom.in/post/iff-comments-on-the-draft-geospatial-information-regulation-bill-2016/</guid>
      <description>Earlier this year, the Ministry of Home Affairs to the Government of India put out a draft bill for comment - the Geospatial Information Regulation Bill, 2016.
As an organisation, one of IFF&amp;rsquo;s core areas is promoting an Internet which preserves freedom for users, designers, scholars and entrepreneurs. Such freedom today is being exercised by most users to generate and contribute geospatial information. Every Indian today with a smartphone is a cartographer who is helping map and digitise India.</description>
