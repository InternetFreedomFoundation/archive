      <description>IFF had filed six RTIs with the MHA seeking data on the e-surveillance. MHA first denied information on grounds of national security and later claimed that the data did not exist. CIC has admonished the CPIO for changing its stance and sought confirmation on non-availability of data on affidavit.</description>

      <description>MHA originally claimed that the RTIs on e-surveillance is exempt for national security, but CIC directed the MHA to re-hear the matter. MHA now claims that it has destroyed the info! We filed another appeal before the CIC, and the Delhi HC  directed the CIC to tell the HC a timeline for our appeal.</description>

      <description>We filed 6 RTI applications in Dec 2018 seeking information about Electronic Surveillance orders passed under Section 69 of the IT Act. Three years have passed since, and we apprehend that the information sought is being continuously destroyed during the pendency of the RTI proceedings.</description>
