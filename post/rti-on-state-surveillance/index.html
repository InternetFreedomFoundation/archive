This SOP saw the light of day for the first time when it was made available by the MHA before the Supreme Court.

Our queries were:\n If a Standard Operating Procedure or similar document has been issued or adopted by the State Government for handling interception requests under the Indian Telegraph Act or the Information Technology Act or its Rules. If there was a Standard Operating Procedure, a copy of it was requested. The number of orders/requests made under Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009 from 2009 till date.  We received responses from various states and union territories that we filed RTIs with. While we were very excited about what we might find, nothing too controversial has surfaced yet. Here are our findings in brief:\n States that follow the MHA SOP: Andhra Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar, Daman and Diu, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry States that have not issued an SOP: Assam, Delhi, Kerala, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura States that have claimed confidentiality: Chandigarh, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana States that have provided copy of their own SOP: Bihar States that have provided number of orders/requests: Andaman and Nicobar: Since 2013, 10 interception requests were made. Assam, Daman and Diu: No information with the IT Department. Bihar: Records are destroyed under Rule 419A. Delhi, Nagaland and Uttar Pradesh: Claimed confidentiality. Himachal Pradesh: Records are periodically destroyed and not made public for security reasoms. Kerala and Meghalaya: No interception orders have been passed. Puducherry: 5 requests have been made for interception of telephone calls.  Analysis of Bihar’s Standard Operating Procedure As you can see, the responses are pretty standard apart from the state of Bihar, which we were most curious about. The SOP appeared to be an exact copy of the MHA SOP. However, a closer look at their SOP showed only minute yet interesting differences, most of which were largely related to designating a more suitable authorised security and law enforcement agency within the State.\nUnlike the MHA SOP, the Bihar SOP provides for an Internal Evaluation Committee to be constituted which has to prepare a bi-monthly report on requisitions made for interceptions and monitoring. What stood out in Bihar’s SOP is the requirement for ‘total target numbers proposed’ and ‘outcome of the interception’ both of which are not part of the MHA SOP. It is impressive to see that Bihar has created and disclosed its own SOP. Unfortunately, certain aspects of our queries were not answered due to the destruction of records under Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules.\nWhile this is extent of information we have as of now, as always, with further responses from the remaining states, we’ll be sure to provide updates.\nImportant Documents  RTI responses from various states (link) Copy of Bihar’s Standard Operating Procedure (link)  Just as curious as us about state ‘secrets’?
