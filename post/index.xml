      <description>Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India in March, 2015. This section was vague and lead to arbitrary arrests of young college students, a cartoonist and many other social media users. Hence, the judgement came as a huge relief. It meant that the unconstitutional Section 66A would not be able to used in future and even pending cases would be closed.</description>

      <description>Today marks Halloween, which is increasingly a day marked in urban India. It is a testament to our syncretic culture that a Halloween celebration gives occasion for people to express themselves with pageantry and costume. Timely as it may seem we take today not only with irreverence but also some seriousness when we call Section 66-A a legal zombie. Why ?
You must have heard about Section 66-A. It was a criminal offence which was vague and was used to jail people for comments they made online.</description>

      <description>The law commission on August 30, 2018 invited public inputs on the law of sedition posing in its first query as whether this archaic law should be repealed. We agree unequivocally, sedition contained in Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code needs to be struck off the statute books, completely. As we documented in our submission to them this is a law which is not only abused against social media users, it causes fear and a tremendous amount of self-censorship.</description>

Over the last two years we&amp;rsquo;ve campaigned against internet shutdowns, for implementation of net neutrality and legal reforms to combat censorship and uphold privacy. We&amp;rsquo;ve done all this working early mornings, late nights, weekends and during lunch breaks, completely as volunteers.</description>

As an organisation we hope to support others like Rethink Aadhaar on the frontlines and grow our work as per our statement on Nov.</description>

Nakul consults as a legal fellow at the Internet Freedom Foundation on online censorship concentrating on online shutdowns and his analysis confirms that the new rules on internet shutdowns issued in August, 2018 are secretive in their operation, lack sufficient safeguards or oversight by an empowered review committee.</description>

      <description>Complete Net Neutrality in India. One step closer to the finish line. Towards yesterday evening we heard news that the Telecom Commission had among other things approved TRAI’s recommendations on net neutrality.
The Process
Last November, the TRAI made recommendations to expressly prohibit discriminatory treatment of content (more information here). The Telecom Commission is the highest decision-making body in the Department of Telecom. After it is approved, the decision is now left to the Union Cabinet.</description>

This work has been extensively covered by The Wire in an opinion piece titled, “The Worst Aspect of India’s Internet Shutdowns Is the Official Secrecy About It”, and “Jan Gan Man Ki Baat, Episode No. 271”.
A Short Recap
 Noticing a growth in the frequency of internet shutdowns and constrained by the lack of movement for reform, on April 22, 2018, we sent a petition to several government ministries and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).</description>

      <description>We often feel we are under constant watch. Our data is gathered continuously and analysed by social networking websites. It can&amp;rsquo;t get worse, or can it?
Well, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting now wants to surveil our social media activities by creating a “Social Media Communication Hub”. Through a tender that was supposed to close today at noon but has now been extended to June 16, it has invited contractors to submit bids to create detailed profiles of us by collecting intimate, personal details from our social media accounts (read more in Scroll).</description>

But we ask the Ministry of Telecom to stop pressing the snooze button on the issue of Internet Shutdowns. Network disruptions require urgent policy and legal intervention. When we launched, KeepUsOnline campaign more than 16,000 people and 100 organisations clearly communicated to the Government that they damage and undermine their fundamental rights, growing digitisation and cause massive economic losses.</description>

      <description>Just like you, we really do care about the internet. It acts as an engine for our economy, allows incredible amounts of individual expression and fosters social connections like never before. Much of the progress we have made is under threat as governments shut down the Internet in different parts of the country. That&amp;rsquo;s why we launched https://KeepUsOnline.in.
Given this continuing concern, we have written to the Prime Minister’s Office to issue a statement against internet shutdowns and have also urged government ministries to take specific steps for legal and administrative reform.</description>

      <description>Today, the Internet Freedom Foundation, an organization born from the SaveTheInternet.in movement for Net Neutrality, filed its submission to the Justice Srikrishna Committee on Data Protection. This committee which has been tasked with framing India&amp;rsquo;s data protection law is an important step in ensuring the online privacy for people in India.
 Earlier IFF through the, &amp;ldquo;Privacy is a Right&amp;rdquo; page had summarised a voluminous white paper and outlined how the public could engage with it (link).</description>

      <description>IFF notes with appreciation the recommendations issued by Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Net Neutrality despite push back from some quarters of the telecommunication industry against any additional regulations. By taking a decisive stand on upholding Net Neutrality, TRAI has built upon the strong foundation it had laid down in 2016 by issuing regulations prohibiting Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services.
We welcome these recommendations for the following reasons:</description>

      <description>When the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) was launched more than a year ago, we had a spirited conversation on taking forward our work from SaveTheInternet.in and net neutrality. What brought us together was a shared passion for protecting the open internet and the digital rights of users. We strongly felt that this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be done without protecting the privacy of individuals. Our very fundamental notions and protections of privacy and data protection are today under challenge by Aadhaar, and we are taking the following steps to protect it.</description>

      <description>Press reports over the past few days have indicated various government proposals, notably the for the introduction of a fresh Section 66A. The Internet Freedom Foundation is releasing a copy of these recommendations to public and calling for a consultation.
Struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 was the unconstitutional tool used to curb free speech on social media. The Section had been used to arrest a number of internet users voicing their political opinions on social media, like in the famous case of Facebook user Shaheen Dhada being arrested for posting her thoughts on the death of politician Bal Thackeray.</description>

      <description>This week, media reports have indicated that the Government of India on August 16, 2017, and August 24, 2017 issued a terse letter directing the blocking of twitter handles, hashtags, and individual tweets. This includes a tweet from the news wire service ANI and parody/gossip handles such as @LutyensMasala and @LutyensSpice. These blocking orders call for urgent focus on the problematic process and legality of website blocking in India.

      <description>Press reports have revealed that the Union Government’s Department of Telecom has issued rules on governing network disruptions or internet shutdowns in India. Titled the “Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017” and issued by the Centre under Section 7 of the Indian Telegraph Act, they were quietly published in the Gazette of India earlier this month on August 7. Quite simply, they provide a legal mechanism under which the internet can be turned off.</description>

The Internet Freedom Foundation, that fights for a fair, open, and neutral internet, wholeheartedly welcomes this decision and thanks the Supreme Court for championing the rights of Indian citizens.
We urge the government to now pass a citizen focused privacy and data protection bill, on the basis of this powerful statement from the Supreme Court, and protect the rights of citizens over their data.</description>

      <description>2016 was a year of impact. Thanks to over a million voices of Indians like you, net neutrality was front and centre in government offices, newsrooms, and the floor of our Parliament, resulting in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) announcing the first set of rules to safeguard an open internet and prevent discrimination from corporate lobbies.
The overwhelming support we received on the Save The Internet campaign led to us launching the Internet Freedom Foundation &amp;ndash; a volunteer driven organisation dedicated to advancing user rights by working on net neutrality, free expression and fighting censorship, privacy and encryption, and innovation.</description>

The Internet Freedom Foundation regards this as a very important issue and we have formally submitted our inputs to this consultation; this post explains our position.
In the consultation paper, TRAI pointed out that our country has woefully few public WiFi hotspots, even compared to other countries far smaller than ours.</description>

The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) made its submissions on the TRAI&amp;rsquo;s pre-consultation on Net Neutrality.
We specifically requested the TRAI to approach any future consultation on net neutrality in the following manner:
  A clear roadmap should be prescribed for network neutrality rulemaking in India. All existing consultations should be closed with specific recommendations. The reasons for conducting future consultations should be flagged and reasoned expressly, so that members of the public and other stakeholders in this issue can meaningfully engage and contribute.</description>

Such freedom today is being exercised by most users to generate and contribute geospatial information.

      <description>The SaveTheInternet.in coalition welcomes news reports indicating that the TRAI has ordered Reliance Communications to temporarily suspend operation of the Free Basics zero rating programme given that its current consultation process is on. As repeatedly stated by us, the TRAI and the Government need to speedily put in place net neutrality regulations to protect Indian citizens and an open Internet. We have stressed that the responsible agencies have a duty to act, including enforcing a moratorium on violations of net neutrality till the conclusion of the consultation process.</description>

      <title>If you&#39;ve been misprepresented by Facebook</title>

      <description>Several people have informed us of instances where they&amp;rsquo;ve been incorrectly shown as supporting Facebook&amp;rsquo;s FreeBasics, when they don&amp;rsquo;t. Please see the footnote for examples.
One way of addressing this situation is to email TRAI to correct your stand. You can do two things:
Firstly, tell the TRAI that Facebook&amp;rsquo;s claim of your support for FreeBasics is not valid. You can mail the following letter to advisorfea1@trai.gov.in.
Secondly, send an email to the TRAI indicating your actual stand to the TRAI.</description>

      <title>STI Statement on Mark Zuckerberg’s townhall at IIT Delhi</title>

      <description>Dear Mark Zuckerberg,
We thank you for your recent visit and your continued interest in India. As a group of volunteers part of the Save the Internet Campaign, we have been engaging on the issue of Network Neutrality for much of the past year. It is a matter of distress that Facebook, through its internet.org platform and in its lobbying on regulatory consultations, has sought to undermine Net Neutrality in India and also increasingly questioned the motives of more than a million Indians who have participated in consultations organised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) as well as the Department of Telecom.</description>

      <description>tl;dr New TRAI Chief is open to VoIP licensing. DoT waiting for TRAI process to end. TRAI open houses sessions haven&amp;rsquo;t even been announced. Parliamentary Standing Committee process is still on. Google and FB support Zero Rating.
Need more Internet Industry support. FB spending lots of money promoting Internet.org. Zuckerberg is going to host a town hall with PM Narendra Modi, and we should participate in the townhall and push for Net Neutrality.</description>

      <description>Update: We have 5 more days to comment. The deadline for comments on MyGov has been extended to 20th August. Some sample comments below. The process:
 Registeron the MyGov.in website Sign into MyGov.in Visit the net neutrality pageand submit a response.  Yesterday: In April, you spoke out in support of an open internet. We’re writing to you because it is time to make our voices heard again.
Despite our 1 million+ emails, the Department of Telecommunications released a draft report with recommendations which appear to favour the creation of a license raj for Internet voice calls and other communication services in India, and can allow telecom operators to create private walled gardens using Zero Rating.</description>

      <description>To Flipkart, Google, Microsoft and Cleartrip,
You&amp;rsquo;ve been invited to depose before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Net Neutrality, according to a notice on the Standing Committee website(via @ianuragthakur).
We, at Savetheinternet.in, would strongly urge you to take a stand in favour of Net Neutrality: against any form of discrimination by access providers, whether in terms of speed, availability or price of access to specific sites.
We can help

      <description>Bharti Airtel Limited is hosting an earnings call today (Wednesday, August 5). The Mint reports that Airtel’s profits rose 40%, beating analysts’ estimates. Mobile data revenue has increased 56.9% and usage has grown 83%.
Only three months ago, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), of which Airtel is a prominent member, claimed that date rates would have to be increased six times to be sustainable. Reports in The Times of India and The Indian Express.</description>

      <description>Hi, just thought I&amp;rsquo;d give you guys a lowdown on where we are with the Net Neutrality battle in India. I might edit this later with more details.
###tl;dr It&amp;rsquo;s not over yet. TRAI process is paused, DoT report looks very worrying, Standing Committee process is on, Digital India makes no mention of Net Neutrality. Given the way Net Neutrality has been defined in RS Prasad&amp;rsquo;s Rajya Sabha statements, it looks the definition of Net Neutrality is still open to change.</description>

      <description>Savetheinternet.in has signed this open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, from digital rights organizations and groups from across the world:
Dear Mark Zuckerberg,
We, the undersigned, share a common concern about the launch and expansion of Facebook’s Internet.org platform and its implications for the open Internet around the world. On that open Internet, all content, applications and services are treated equally, without any discrimination. We are especially concerned that access for impoverished people is construed as justification for violations of net neutrality.</description>

      <title>The Consultation process must continue: too early for litigation</title>

      <description>Last week through press reports we have come to know about a group called the INIEWA which is run by Mr. Varun Bajaj sent a legal notice to the Department of Telecom. These press reports state that INIEWA shares the goal of various internet users in India to safeguard net neutrality. The notice mentions that failing action, INIEWA will approach court.
While we, at Savetheinternet.in, believe that there shouldn’t be licensing of internet platforms and that we need legal regulations to ensure Net Neutrality, we also believe that this isn’t the right time to approach court for protecting Net Neutrality, for the following reasons:</description>

      <title>The Basics of Net Neutrality</title>

      <guid>https://archive.internetfreedom.in/post/the-basics-of-net-neutrality/</guid>
      <description>The debate on net neutrality is at its fiercest these days. The debate is also chaotic and noisy. While over 10 lakh individuals have written to TRAI favouring Net Neutrality, the operators have compared this massive response with something akin to a mob, asking the TRAI to decide the issue based on their own responses rather than going by those 10 lakh emails.
This debate is not really being carried out in a way it should be.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s the last day for filing your submissionswith the TRAI on its Consultation paper for Internet applications and services.
The Cellular Operators Association of India, and the Telecom industry CEOs, who pushed for this consultation, are hosting a press conference today in Delhi at Hotel Lalit at 11.30 AM, probably announcing &amp;lsquo;Sabka Internet&amp;rsquo;, for which they have polled Indian mobile users in a disingenuous manner (more on that here).
Here are some questions that we would ask the telecom companies, had we been there.</description>

      <description>Sir,
this is with reference to an opinion piece in the Mint: Leave the Internet Alone.
The authors appear to be misled regarding the campaign for Net Neutrality in India, although there isn’t a specific reference to Savetheinternet.inand the group of volunteers that seeded it. The draft responses we have published on our site request allowing for legitimate network management without paid prioritization, while requesting the enforcement of transparency to ensure prevention of discrimination.</description>

You, our representatives, and your parties, also use it to gather research about the issues faced by your constituents, the challenges faced by different parts of our country, and the expert knowledge needed to legislate for India’s future and shape our national decisions.

      <description>We don’t. We love free stuff as much as you do. We love Wikipedia for the stupendous volume of human knowledge it is, and can only wish that everyone in the world has access to it for as low a cost as possible (all costs considered, from phone to data plan). We love our free torrents too.
Who can hate free stuff? Why would we deny someone else getting something for free, whether it’s free data or free services?</description>

      <description>On April 18th, Airtel sent a letter, called #airtelpledge (read), to all its employees and all its postpaid users, making some claims and promises about Airtel Zero. We’re addressing a few claims made in the letter here:
  Airtel said that it is committed to Net Neutrality. However, Airtel cannot be committed to Net Neutrality while simultaneously violating it. The TRAI consultation paper (read) itself says on page 77:</description>
