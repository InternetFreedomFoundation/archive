Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.\nWhy is transparency important? The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.\nThe Right to Information Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with and demand transparency and accountability from the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of January, we have up till now filed 32 RTI requests with authorities at the Central and State level, both electronically and through physical filing on the various issues on which we engage with the government.\nNote: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month’s report may be included in the present report.\nData Protection and Privacy One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 30 requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.\nUnder IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology. This month, we filed requests with:\n The Delhi Police, The Director General of Police Office, Uttar Pradesh, The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, The Odisha Police, The Bengaluru Police, The Bhubhaneshwar Police, The Police Commissioner Office, Lucknow \u0026 The Education Department, Delhi Government.  Additionally we also filed requests with:\n The National Health Authority on the drafting of the National Digital Health Mission policy. We have also received the reply to this request. The National Health Authority on responses received as part of the public consultation on the draft for Health Data Management Policy. We have also received the reply to this request. The National Health Authority on the pilot projects of the National Digital Health Mission being launched in Chandigarh, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep. We have also received the reply to the request. The National Health Authority on the notification issued for the implementation of the National Digital Health Mission. We have also received the reply to the request. The Department of Electronics \u0026 Information Technology on the CO-WIN application for COVID-19 vaccine registration.

The Department of Electronics \u0026 Information Technology on the government-appointed expert panel that has been formed to monitor the data being captured by the Aarogya Setu application.  Free Speech and Censorship Our other main focus is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.\nIn the month of January, we have up till now filed 2 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:\n The Department of Telecommunications on the amendment of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017.
