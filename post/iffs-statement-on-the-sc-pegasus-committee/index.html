Subsequent reporting by the Wire and the Washington Post revealed that forensic analysis conducted by Amnesty International’s Security Lab definitively showed that the Pegasus spyware had been used to target 37 phones, of which 10 belonged to Indians.\nMr. Rupesh Kumar Singh and Ms. Ipsa Shatakshi are independent activists of repute, with over seven years of standing. Both of their phone numbers are in the leaked database. However, as of the date, it has not been verified whether their phones were attacked with the Pegasus Spyware. Mr. Singh and Ms. Shatakshi have approached the Supreme Court asking it to declare that the use of spyware such as Pegasus, is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has pronounced a judgment regarding the use of Pegasus, constituting a committee of technical experts to examine the allegations of unauthorised surveillance using the Pegasus spyware. This is not the first time that the Supreme Court has taken such a measure, since earlier this year the Court had also constituted a four member expert committee on the controversial farm laws.\nThis Committee comes in the wake of the Government of West Bengal’s Commission of Inquiry, a two member Commission set up to investigate the issue. On August 3, 2021, the Commission had issued a public notice calling for statements on the Pegasus revelations. However, consequently, on August 25, 2021, the Government of West Bengal told the Supreme Court that the two-member Commission of Inquiry, headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Justice Madan B. Lokur, will not proceed until the apex court hears petitions seeking a probe into the alleged surveillance scandal as well as those challenging the state government’s decision to appoint the commission.\nThe Committee has been authorised by the Supreme Court to devise its own procedure, conduct investigation as it deems fit, take statements of any person in connection with the enquiry, and crucially “call for records of any authority or individual”. We urge the Committee of Experts to adhere to the following best practices:\nThe Committee must place a public advertisement, preferably in a widely read national daily newspaper, calling for victims and those affected by Pegasus to submit comments to the Committee. The Committee must invite comments, suggestions and submissions from civil society organisations, independent technical and domain experts including Amnesty Tech and Citizen Lab, who have worked specifically on uncovering the use of Pegasus. The Committee must summon relevant government officials from the Ministries of Home Affairs, Electronics \u0026 Information Technology, Communication, Law \u0026 Justice and the Prime Minister’s Office (including the Cabinet Secretary) to provide testimony before it. The Committee must conduct a first hand forensic analysis of the affected devices in accordance with the highest international standards to ascertain the presence of the Pegasus and the probable attack vector. The Committee must make public all the submissions it receives from members of civil society and other independent cybersecurity researchers as well as the final findings of their own analysis. The Committee must make public the final report that it will submit to the Supreme Court at the end of its examination. It is important to ensure that the Committee proceeds with the tenets of transparency and accountability in place since these norms have already been violated by the unconstitutional use of Pegasus on the victims.\nImportant Documents SC appoints a committee to examine the use of Pegasus Spyware in India dated October 27, 2021 (link) IFF’s Statement on Hacking Revelations made by the Pegasus Project dated July 19, 2021 (link) ","wordCount":"634","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-11-10T08:07:21Z","dateModified":"2021-11-10T08:07:21Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anushka Jain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://archive.internetfreedom.in/post/iffs-statement-on-the-sc-pegasus-committee/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Internet Freedom Foundation","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://archive.internetfreedom.in/iff-icon-125.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://archive.internetfreedom.in accesskey=h title="IFF (Alt + H)"><img src=https://archive.internetfreedom.in/iff-logo-600x250.png alt aria-label=logo height=40>IFF</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://archive.internetfreedom.in/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://archive.internetfreedom.in/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://archive.internetfreedom.in/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://archive.internetfreedom.in/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>IFF’s Statement on the Supreme Court Pegasus Committee</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-11-10 08:07:21 +0000 UTC'>November 10, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Anushka Jain&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/InternetFreedomFoundation/archive/tree/main/content/post/iffs-statement-on-the-sc-pegasus-committee.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#important-documents aria-label="Important Documents">Important Documents</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><figure class="kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class=kg-gallery-container><div class=kg-gallery-row><div class=kg-gallery-image><img src=https://internetfreedom.in/content/images/2021/11/1-17.jpg width=100% height=auto></div></div></div></figure><p>On <a href=https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-statement-on-hacking-revelations-made-by-the-pegasus-project/>July 18, 2021</a>, The Wire, as part of an international collaborative investigation titled “Pegasus Project”, revealed that the Israeli spyware firm NSO targeted “over 300 verified Indian mobile telephone numbers, including those used by ministers, opposition leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, government officials, scientists, rights activists and others” through their spyware, Pegasus.
