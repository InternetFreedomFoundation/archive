At this critical juncture, we need your support! There are many fun ways you can do this, including getting your hands on the fresh IFF x Sanitary Panels collaboration hosted at Frankly Wearing ‚Äî cheekily hinting at your agency in the fight against surveillance, this high-quality and breathable cotton tee/hoodie/crop top checks all our boxes ‚úÖ\n   All proceeds from this sale will go towards the Internet Freedom Foundation  New members aren‚Äôt able to sign up, and if your membership was not able to resume either, consider helping us out by making a one-time annual or bi-annual contribution to digital rights advocacy in India. Donate to IFF now.\n    For queries, please write in to us at donate@internetfreedom.in\n Let‚Äôs start off with some good news: The Competition Commission of India has accepted IFF‚Äôs expert information in its investigation of WhatsApp‚Äôs 2021 Privacy Policy! We highlighted the dominant position WhatsApp holds in its market, and how the latest Privacy Policy abuses such leverage. As a result, we are now a formal party before the Director-General (and will participate as such) in the investigation proceedings.\nThe Supreme Court of India says: Investigate Pegasus! A committee of independent technical experts has been constituted to investigate allegations of unauthorised surveillance using the Pegasus spyware. IFF was glad to be able to provide legal assistance to petitioners Ipsa Shatakshi and Rupesh Kumar Singh, and general support in the ongoing Pegasus petitions.\n The Facebook Files: Facebook is tearing democracies apart, and it knows. Whistleblowers Frances Haugen and Sophie Zhang have publicly released hundreds of internal Facebook documents that not only bare the extent of Facebook‚Äôs carnage across the world, but also the fact that Facebook knows (and doesn‚Äôt seem to care).\nKeeping in mind the nature of these revelations, especially with leaked documents that disclose Facebook‚Äôs internal research on how misinformation is spread in India and its decision to prioritise profit over safety, we wrote to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on IT, asking for an official inquiry to be initiated into the revelations made. The importance of testimony is crucial here ‚Äî from both the whistleblowers as well as Facebook India‚Äôs Managing Director, Mr. Ajit Mohan.\nIt‚Äôs also important to note here the disconnect between what Facebook articulates in its public reports and the messy reality it buries in its internal documents. Our analyses of the latest ‚ÄòCompliance Reports‚Äô mandated by the IT Rules 2021 aim to break it down (Spoiler Alert: Facebook does really, really bad at moderating online bullying and harassment).\n Penalties for‚Ä¶ what? Did you know? The new ‚ÄòResponsible Vulnerability Disclosure and Coordination Policy‚Äô by CERT-IN penalises cybersecurity researchers for vulnerability disclosures. Vulnerability disclosure is when a hacker discovers a security vulnerability and makes it public to quickly force patches to these issues. This is a big blow to data security since most data breaches (or vulnerabilities) only become public due to voluntary action by whitehat hackers.\nThere‚Äôs also been a recent trend of copyright law being used to take down content owned by independent news media and penalise them for‚Ä¶ not breaking any intellectual property laws at all. Big media houses now use the effective strategy of ‚Äòcomplaint bombing‚Äô to stifle fair critique! Read more about in our letter to Google India on the incorrect application of copyright law.\n Right to Information     Last month, IFF filed 26 RTI requests and 3 First Appeals. around issues relating to data protection and privacy, free speech and censorship, and net neutrality.\nIf these sound too abstract, here are some concrete issues: AI based facial recognition attendance systems across 48000 government schools in Assam, NATGRID‚Äôs budgetary allocations and budgetary expenditure, and multiple MoUs signed between government agencies and private corporations (including Amazon, Jio, and CISCO). Read it all.\n [Privacy Edition] The more you know: üëÅ‚Äçüó® Illegal CCTVs are still on our scanner, and IFF wrote to the Hon‚Äôble Lt. Governor of Delhi to highlight key privacy concerns in such a situation for citizens of Delhi.\nüëÅ‚Äçüó® IFF drew attention to significant issues of exclusion, privacy, and surveillance within the current Aadhaar regime in comments on the Draft Aadhaar (Pricing of Aadhaar Authentication Services) Regulations 2021.\nüëÅ‚Äçüó® Government and private entities instantly knowing a person‚Äôs vaccination status may sound good in theory, but in practice bring along major concerns. Read our joint letter (along with C-HELP and FMES) to the National Health Authority.\nüëÅ‚Äçüó® The Hyderabad Police were stopping random persons on the road without any ‚Äúreasonable suspicion‚Äù to check their phones. This abuse of the uniform led us to assist privacy researcher Mr. Srinivas Kodali in drafting and sending a legal notice to the Hyderabad Police Commissioner, asking for a halt to this entirely illegal process.\nüëÅ‚Äçüó® The RBI‚Äôs new Account Aggregator framework has been hyped as ‚Äútransformative‚Äù, but its reality of sharing potentially unlimited amounts of sensitive personal data with an unbounded set of entities for no specific purpose bring in crucial privacy concerns.\nP.S: Inaction by the Delhi Police on the notorious ‚ÄúSulli Deals‚Äù incident led us to write to them, asking for an expeditious investigation so that closure and support is provided to those affected.\n üì¨ Must read: Impunity for illegal surveillance must end. Almost 180 journalists were selected as Pegasus targets across the globe. Increasingly used as a laser-focused tactic, surveillance has become a weapon to intimidate, instil fear, and paralyse the work of journalists, putting sources at risk and impeding journalists from exposing crime and corruption.\nIt can‚Äôt be denied any longer: Authoritarian surveillance affects journalists' safety and freedom.\n Parting notes Our work is only possible due to the support we get from you ‚Äî our members, donors, and volunteers. Your donations fund our operational costs, public advocacy and strategic litigation: signing up as an IFF member or making a one time donation provides us with the stable base we need for long-term, critical impact.\nBegin a conversation on digital rights in India by sending this to friends, family, and loved ones, and let them know ‚Äî we‚Äôre watching the watchmen, and need their help too.\nDo you have a question or a thought?
