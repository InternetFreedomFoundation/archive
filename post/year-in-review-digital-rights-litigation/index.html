After the nationwide lockdown was announced in March 2020, courts across the country shut down their physical premises and migrated to virtual hearings conducted through video conferencing. Virtual hearings have been marred by technical glitches and courts have been reluctant to conduct substantive hearings in regular matters which do not involve any urgency. However, threats to our civil liberties have only increased during this period with the government using the pandemic as an excuse to launch surveillance projects such as the Aarogya Setu app and the BECIL tracking tool for healthcare workers and patients.\nGrowing strategic litigation for digital rights Despite these challenges, we worked with highly skilled and accomplished litigators to provide pro-bono legal representation to nine organisations and individuals in 2020. The clients we have represented this year include but are not limited to:\n  Foundation for Media Professionals, a journalist body which challenged the 4G mobile internet ban in Jammu \u0026 Kashmir. 4G mobile internet was finally restored in 2 out of 20 districts of Jammu \u0026 Kashmir on 16 August 2020 but a lot more remains to be done.

(Read more)\n  Much more in store Litigation work often has a long gestation period and over the past two months, we have been working on several new cases which will be publicly disclosed in the coming weeks. The issues we have been working on include the 4G mobile internet ban in Jammu \u0026 Kashmir which has crossed 500 days and attempts to judicially create a right to be forgotten in India. We would not like to over claim, but do wish to set out that pending and disposed cases have resulted in incremental and positive movement for digital rights. You can view our larger litigation docket right here on the substantive outcomes.\nThis has not happened due to our efforts in isolation and is to the credit of this entire sector – individuals, groups and organisations. More on that in the next section.\nBetter outcomes with the best litigators! Our litigation advocacy has been made possible through a framework of internal capacity and a network of pro bono lawyers who have generously devoted their time and energy to these cases. We are extremely grateful to the following litigators (in alphabetical order) for their support in 2020: Astha Sharma (Advocate on Record), Abhinav Sekhri, Angaj Gautam, Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Bharat Gupta, Gautam Bhatia, Huzefa Ahmadi (Senior Advocate), Jahnavi Sindhu, KV Viswanathan (Senior Advocate), Mukunda Rao, Nakul Dewan (Senior Advocate), Prateek Chadha (Advocate on Record), Rajasekhar Rao, Rahul Narayan (Advocate on Record), Ria Singh Sawhney, Shyam Divan (Senior Advocate), S. Prasanna, Sai Vinod, Santhosh Mathew, Shadan Farasat (Advocate on Record), Suhrith Parathasarathy and Surasika Parathasarathy. Many more lawyers have worked with us closely last year, we remain in gratitude towards their contributions towards building our strategic litigation vertical.\nLast but certainly not the least, IFF’s litigation vertical has been helmed by our Of Counsel, Vrinda Bhandari, Litigation Fellow, Sanjana Srikumar, and Litigation Counsel, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay, who have pulled many all nighters and worked through many weekends to ensure our small team can achieve its mighty goal of defending digital rights of Indian internet users. IFF’s Board Chair, Raman Chima, and Executive Director, Apar Gupta, have also been an indispensable part of our litigation team and our court centred interventions would not be possible or as impactful without their strategic guidance and assistance with stakeholder outreach.\nLooking towards next year We recognise that many people feel disillusioned by the judicial system but we believe that by adopting a strategy of incrementalism and iteration, it is still possible to achieve positive outcomes through litigation. This also helps us minismise the risk of setting precedent that despite the best intention, end up hurting rather than helping. Most importantly, the success of any court centered intervention often depends on public outreach, collaboration with experts, prior policy level enagagement and information gathering through RTIs, and we hope to continue following this multi-pronged advocacy model going forward in 2021.\nIFF plans to follow an integrated approach towards strategic litigation that advances our constitutional values. Do you have suggestions on what we can do better? Reach out to us by filling in this form and letting us know what we should focus towards in 2021, or let us know how we can make our existing work more effective.\n","wordCount":"967","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-12-31T04:38:00Z","dateModified":"2020-12-31T04:38:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Devdutta Mukhopadhyay"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://archive.internetfreedom.in/post/year-in-review-digital-rights-litigation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Internet Freedom Foundation","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://archive.internetfreedom.in/iff-icon-125.png"}}}</script>
