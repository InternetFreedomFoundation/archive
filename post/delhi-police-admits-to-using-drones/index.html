The Delhi Police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections and during the riots in North-East Delhi. This is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.Wait…. What?\nThe Delhi Police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. The first reports emerged in December, 2019 when it was reported that anti-CAA protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. This was in addition to the Delhi Police’s use of facial recognition technology to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the Delhi Police to cease such use here).\nSubsequently, there were reports that the Delhi Police used drones on crowds during the Republic Day parade in January, 2020 to “maintain vigil”. In February, 2020 there were reports that the Delhi Police had used drones to “monitor the situation” during the riots in North-East Delhi.\nNow reports are emerging that the Delhi Police is using drones to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the Government in a bid to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\nThe Delhi Police confirms using drones\nOn February 14, 2020, we filed a Right to Information request with the Delhi Police asking the following questions:\nWhether the Delhi Police has procured drones for any purpose?\nDetails of the tender issued for such procurement.\nInformation about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.\nInformation with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.\nWhether these drones were deployed in December, 2019 and January, 2020?\nAny guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the Delhi Police.\nOur request was transferred to various departments of the Delhi Police. We received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. However, in a reply dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones.\nHere is a point-wise summary of their reply:\nThe North-East District has hired drones for maintaining law and order.\nSince the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.\nThe Delhi Police has been hiring drones from the open market through Station House Officers (SHO).\nThe technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the PIO.\nThe PIO confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election which were held on February 8, 2020 and during the riots in North-East Delhi which began on February 23, 2020.\nIn response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the Delhi Police, the reply was “no comment”.\nWhy does this matter anyway?\nThere are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in Delhi.\nHiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. As a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.\nSince there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. There is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed.\nSo what now?\nIFF has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a legal vacuum. The only regulations for drones in India are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Drones are being used in Delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. It is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. We urge the Delhi Police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urge the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. This is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.\n(This post has been authored by Anushka Jain, a legal fellow at IFF, and reviewed by IFF staffer Sidharth)\nImportant Documents\nRight to Information Request filed by IFF questioning the use of drones by the Delhi Police (link) Reply received from the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police (link) Let’s keep our skies clear and clean of illegal surveillance drones.
