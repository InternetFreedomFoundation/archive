Yes! TRAI has finally proposed net neutrality  regulation!

But there's a catch.

Big telcos are lobbying hard to kill any meaningful net neutrality, and to punch loopholes in last year's pro-user regulations. They are very well organized and have deep pockets.

Unless TRAI hears our voices loud and clear, and knows that lakhs of Indians are watching and paying attention, telcos will get their way.

Help save the Internet one more time. Send an email to TRAI.
