As we start to slowly move towards a “new normal”, we are gearing up for new work patterns to operate and raise money. We are in the process of building the Internet Freedom Resilience Fund that can provide us a financial runway for the next two years and bring organisational stability.

## **What is the Resilience Fund?**

We are opening up the Resilience Fund to the IFF donor community with a hope to be able to raise Rs. 80,00,000. This Fund will help us build a financial runway for the next two years and enable us to continue our ongoing projects as well as to develop new ones. It will complement our individual fundraising efforts that will match at least 50% of all large HNI and individual donations. It is in recognition that our challenges are growing, so should IFF's capacity and impact. [A detailed brief on the fund is attached here.](http://drive.google.com/file/d/1-i4XpHG5yOcrq_t63PG4QGoEfEJUPJWE/view?usp=sharing)

We have already raised Rs. 30,00,000 out of this goal and with your help we are confident of reaching our target. To reach this goal we encourage you to plan your giving with us over the next two years by pledging your contribution to us and/or making introductions to any other potential donors within your networks. The Internet Freedom Resilience Fund is not only about sustainability but acceleration. Pledge your contributions right away!
