<p style="text-align:center;">We've raised Rs. 1,30,105 so far! (well over our goal of Rs. 1,27,001!)</p>

IFF is a non-profit organisation that works on digital rights. This helps preserves the open internet. Most of our work is funded on individual giving from Indians who are helping us scale up. After reaching the 500 individual donor mark, we have recently opened up for organisational donations which is receiving immense interest and support. 

We are excited that [Obvious](https://obvious.in/) is committing a donor matching program. [Obvious](https://obvious.in/) mission is to help people build digital products their customers love using. This donor matching program is a 1:1 match which runs from Monday, May 20th till Sunday, June 30th. Basically, every time you give us 1 rupee (that enters our account between May 20th and June 30th) it is matched by them.

[Obvious](https://obvious.in/) has committed to a sum of Rs. 1,27,001 (Like the IP address for localhost - 127.0.0.1).

So donate generously and remember, all donations to IFF are tax exempt and help you claim a tax write off. Let us give back to the internet! Keep it free, open and healthy! If you are an organisation that is interested in donating to IFF or even hosting our donate link or page on your app or website do reach out to us. We need all the help we can get.
