As a donor funded organisation which works on contributions from the public we believe that your support and faith can only be maintained with greater transparency about our financial needs, fund inflows and expenses. To do this, IFF is immediately implementing two systems where it will first aim to provide a monthly statement of reciepts starting November, 2018 with analytics (without personal data) and second, provide a much more detailed year end financial snapshot of our finances. 

We hope to supplement the year end financial snapshot which we presently provide with a much more detailed, narrative annual report in the coming year which engages and grows your trust in supporting our shared mission for an open and free internet. If you have any thoughts on how we can do this better, or would like to volunteer or help out, do reach out to us. 

Our commitment is to bring greater accountability to our functioning and ensure that our larger community of supporters and volunteers know how much money we have and how we are using it. We hope to deliver on this constantly over time. 

#### Our Registrations

#### Financial Disclosures for 2016-18 
Data from our online payment gateway over the past two years (till September 25, 2018) reveals than about two hundred seventy three people supported work on online privacy, free expression, net neutrality and innovation in India by making a contribution to IFF. Several trustees helped cover the cost of various minor IFF expenses at the outset (these were sometimes out-of pocket for which reimbursement was not sought). Also many donations were made online with the average donation size being Rs. 2,800. Please note that this data is only from the online payment gateway and does not include direct bank deposits made by cheque and other modes outside it.

For a fuller accounting we are providing a snapshot of our audited tax filings for the assesment years of 2017-18 and 2018-19. For the assesment year 2017-18 (which is calculated from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017) we got contributions of about Rs. 4,40,525 and booked expenses of Rs. 7,566. The low amount of expenses was primarily as we were just starting out and our needs increased in the subsequent year. For the assement year 2018-19 (which is calculated from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018) we got a net reciept of Rs. 2,62,414 and had expenses of Rs. 3,93,864.

The nature of expenses, were primarily webservices to support online campaigns, some payments to vendors for such webservices were also made, there are also some travel reibursements and a convening function for digital rights organisations to mark the anniversary of the Section 66A verdict in which we footed a part of the bill. Yes, you deserve a better accounting as we institute systems, as stated in the beginning of this post we hope to provide you a detailed annual statement. 

#### Further Transparency
At present we are working on a finance policy that sets a fundraising target, individual membership programmes that are meaningful and provide engagement with our goals for a better internet in India that ushers innovation and respects your rights to speech, privacy and network neutrality. We encourage you to reach out to us with any thoughts or suggestions at finance@internetfreedom.in
