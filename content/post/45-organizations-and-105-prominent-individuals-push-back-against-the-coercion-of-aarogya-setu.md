### Tl;dr

Today, we sent a [joint representation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3/view?usp=sharing) to the Prime Minister's Office that is endorsed by 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals against the mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu App dated May 1, 2020. This joint representation becomes all the more urgent given yesterday's [direction by the Home Ministry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXzfI9uPv0Qr4YZBKXwk_1Z1M2skYfzl/view?usp=sharing) for the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu and for it's "100% coverage" especially in all workplaces. Violation of this direction can lead to criminal penalties thereby Aarogya Setu now not only impacts the data privacy of workers, or can lead to risks of exclusion and misidentification, a person not having it on their phone can also be charged with a criminal offence. This marks a dramatic and clear shift in government policy on Aarogya Setu from, "encouragement" towards coercion and increases the legitimacy of the demands articulated by the joint representation.

### A joint representation co-signed by 45 organisations and more than 100 people

In [yesterday's post](https://internetfreedom.in/workers-privacy-during-covid-19/) we released a joint representation signed by 37 organisations and 75 individuals against mandating the use of the Aarogya Setu on workers. After we opened it for further sign-ons this number has grown to 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals who have expressed solidarity against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on workers. The endorsements are from a broad swathe of Indian society including trade unions, people's movements, digital rights organizations, public health experts, former civil servants and bureaucrats, activists, academics, technologists, journalists, lawyers etc.

A copy of the [joint representation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3) was sent today with a covering letter to the Prime Minister's Office with a copy to Ministry of Home Affairs and other central government ministries.

To this we attached [a covering letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RR3tBnJCSkQvSDp0uVcMQr6C2RILgqg4/view?usp=sharing) dated May 2, 2020 which further notes with concern yesterday evening's development of the issuance of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) has been issued on May 1, 2020 around 6:00 PM by the Ministry of Home Affairs requiring mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu. This goes against the core demands of the joint representation which is attached to this covering letter.

### Aarogya Setu : Not only mandatory but also criminal penalties

The Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A), which has been issued under Section 10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates for the mandatory installation and operation of Aarogya Setu in two specific ways:

1. First, after classification of the districts into three zones, for the Red (Hotspots) Zones, a further sub-classification has been made for, “_containment zones_”. As per the Order under Section 3(iii), “_The local authority shall ensure 100% coverage of Aarogya Setu app among the residents of Containment Zones_”.
2. Second, at Para 15(i) further reference is made for, “_all the district magistrates_” to, “_strictly enforce the lockdown measures_” for, “_public and workplaces, as specified in Annexure I_”. This direction extends to all three zones. Annexure I further states at Point No. 15 that, “_Use of Aarogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public. It shall be responsibility of the Head of the respective Organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among employees_”.

Presently here are no exceptions or conditionality provided in these directions which place emphasis on 100% coverage in effect meaning total and complete mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu for all workers, all across the country. The order further indicates criminal penalties for non-compliance in Paragraph No. 16 that states, “_Any person violating these lockdown measures and the National Directives for Covid-19 Management will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provision of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC and other legal provisions as applicable_”. The specific provision that may be attracted for prosecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is Section 51(b) that provides for a maximum punishment of up to 1 year for disobedience, and 2 years when such actions may lead to a loss of life. The penalty for conviction under Section 188 of the IPC extends to 6 months imprisonment.

Hence, the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu is not only an issue of data privacy but second order harms which spring from it now includes loss of urban mobility, use of public spaces and transit, livelihood and personal liberty for millions of Indians all over India. Specially those without smartphones devices given the lack of any exemption categories.

### Intention for further action

We at IFF in continuation of this Joint Representation dated May 1, 2020 and through this covering letter have requested specific review of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) and will also be shortly reaching out to each one of the co-signees and collaborators urging them to send individual letters of concern as much as examine further advocacy actions against this grave breach.

We also remain open to any suggestions and advice on what we can do better, or different not only through our collaborators, but even members of the public. We invite you to write to us, or discuss these issues over at the [Internet Freedom Forum](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

As stated before we at IFF will continue conducting public advocacy, awareness especially through digital media as well as continue to engage pro-actively with all government institutions on the issues concerning Aarogya Setu. This includes representations, RTI requests as well as other legal remedies which may be examined at an appropriate stage in consultation with IFF's legal team and several lawyers who continue to volunteer thier time and labour towards protecting fundamental rights.
