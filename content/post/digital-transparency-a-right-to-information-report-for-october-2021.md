### **tl;dr**

Since our last report for the month of September, IFF has filed **49 RTI requests.** Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and an analysis of the responses we have received from the different public authorities. This report highlights why demanding transparency and accountability from government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.

### **Why is transparency important?**

The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able to secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.

The Right to Information (RTI) Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from, the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of October, we have filed 49 RTI requests with authorities at the Central level as well as through speed posts with relevant authorities at the States’ levels, concerning the various issues on which we engage with the Government.

**Note**: The number of RTI requests are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month's report may be included in the present report.

### **Data Protection and Privacy**

One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices that will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 16 RTI requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.

Under IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology (FRT). We also enquire about the related surveillance technologies that the public authorities deploy. This month, we filed requests with:

1. The **[Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Office](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NmDvirNS41Gzhthft8gPZ2G1b4Qn7NWq/view)** regarding the use of a face recognition system by law enforcement launched on October 5, 2021.

Additionally, we also filed requests with:

**Significant responses received on our RTI applications:**

We also found that no legal opinion was asked for & no cost-benefit analyses or feasibility studies took place.

### **Free Speech and Censorship**

Another focus of our work is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances that may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.

In the last month, we have filed 33 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:

1. The [**District Administration of Ajmer**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFCwZL1-pUYV728jouVCB1FEqBT2gkRK/view?usp=sharing) over suspension of internet services on 26.09.2021.

### **Significant responses received on our RTI applications:**

1. The [replies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11GddVJHv5zEh155JCsRCCerRmztxrbM3/view) received from the Udaipur Divisional Commissioner revealed that the office has issued 26 internet shutdown orders, most of which are similar and have followed an identical copy-paste template - i) a bureaucrat recommends suspension of internet services citing ‘law and order’ concerns;  (ii) the Divisional Commissioner expresses their satisfaction with the recommendation without providing any reasons; and (iii) the Divisional Commissioner suspends internet services. The similarity between the orders indicates a non-application of mind on the part of the officers responsible.
2. The [replies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DXX-5uK4C27cASKLFZElIXz-W0Jt_dGT/view?usp=sharing) received from other districts show that the orders which were issued on 25.09.2021 to suspend internet services on 26.09.2021 in various districts to conduct REET, noted that REET will lead to the movement of candidates throughout Rajasthan, and there is an apprehension of disruption of public safety due to fake news and false rumours that can be spread through social media. Interestingly, some of these orders also refer to “anti-social elements” spreading misinformation on the internet.

### **Media Mentions**

Our advocacy for wider access to information by the public has been acknowledged by different media reports on several occasions.

1. The Wire, in its [article](https://thewire.in/government/rajasthan-cheating-paper-leaks-in-govt-exams-put-aspirants-lives-at-stake) on the internet shutdowns in Rajasthan during exams, quoted IFF’s RTI work and our February 2021 report.
2. IFF’s RTIs over the internet shutdown in Rajasthan was quoted in The Straits Times in their article ‘[Frequent Internet shutdowns cause billions of dollars in losses to the Indian economy](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/frequent-internet-shutdowns-cause-billions-of-dollars-in-losses-to-the-indian)'.
