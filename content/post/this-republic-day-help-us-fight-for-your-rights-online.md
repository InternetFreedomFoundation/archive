2016 was a year of impact. Thanks to over a million voices of Indians like you, net neutrality was front and centre in government offices, newsrooms, and the floor of our Parliament, resulting in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) announcing the first set of rules to safeguard  an open internet and prevent discrimination from corporate lobbies. 

The overwhelming support we received on the Save The Internet campaign led to us launching the Internet Freedom Foundation -- a volunteer driven organisation dedicated to advancing user rights by working on net neutrality, free expression and fighting censorship, privacy and encryption, and innovation. And we’ve hit the ground running! 

Over the span of our initial 6 months last year, we were able to:

- [continue fighting for safeguarding net neutrality by engaging the TRAI](https://internetfreedom.in/iffs-summary-of-trais-new-net-neutrality-paper/) on passing binding rules to prevent harmful behaviour by telecom companies;
- advocate for the [protection of privacy and user concerns](https://internetfreedom.in/concerns-trai-wifi-hotspot/) in public WiFi and Digital India policy proposals; 
- [intervene before the Delhi High Court](https://internetfreedom.in/intervention-in-the-high-court-of-delhi-on-the-right-to-be-forgotten/) to provide a user voice around protecting free expression and rights in its ‘Right to be Forgotten’ hearing in the Laksh Vir Singh Yadav case;
- monitor legal arguments before appellate courts regarding [protecting privacy and safeguarding your data on mobile messaging platforms](https://internetfreedom.in/whatsapp-privacy-case-calls-for-urgent-government-action-to-protect-user-privacy/);
- [legally warn government officials from censoring your freedom to speak online](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-demands-indore-collector-withdraw-notice-on-social-media-censorship/) and discuss issues of the day on social media
- support efforts to [reform laws that chill the functioning of the press and free expression](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-supports-speechbill-in/)
