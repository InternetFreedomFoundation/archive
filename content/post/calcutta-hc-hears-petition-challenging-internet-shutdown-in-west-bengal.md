### tl;dr

On 03.03.2022, the State of West Bengal issued an [order](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CRBscgq3u4P_2MCNJlbxZH8JHCvOerEo/view?usp=sharing) under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘**CrPC**’) directing the suspension of internet services in parts of 7 districts across West Bengal. A Petition was filed in the Calcutta High Court challenging this order. The Petition was extensively heard by a bench led by the Chief Justice on 09.03.2022. The Bench has listed the matter for 2 pm on 10.03.2022 based on the Advocate General’s submissions that a Review Committee constituted under the Telecom Suspension Rules is meeting tomorrow at 11 am.

### Why Should You Care?

The State of West Bengal has issued an [order](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CRBscgq3u4P_2MCNJlbxZH8JHCvOerEo/view?usp=sharing) directing suspension of internet services for ten days in parts of 7 districts of West Bengal from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM (‘Suspension Order’). Of the ten days during the operation of the Suspension Order, the internet will be suspended on 8 days, i.e., 07.03.2022, 08.03.2022, 09.03.2022, 11.03.2022, 12.03.2022, 14.03.2022, 15.03.2022 and 16.03.2022. This shutdown applies to all forms of the internet, i.e. broadband, leased line, mobile data, 2G/3G/4G etc.

### There are serious concerns with the Order

The Suspension Order was issued under [Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (‘CrPC’)](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/930621/) and has been purportedly issued on the basis of intelligence reports which suggested that the internet may be used for ‘unlawful activities’ on the aforementioned days. The Suspension Order is unreasoned as it does not specify the nature of unlawful activities that may be committed.

What is interesting to note is that the date and time during which internet suspension has been ordered coincide with the date and time of Madhyamik Pariksha (Secondary Examination), 2022 (‘**Madhyamik Pariksha**’). This suggests that the unlawful activities mentioned in the Suspension Order may be [cheating](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/west-bengal-bans-net-services-on-class-10-board-exam-days-in-some-areas-to-stop-cheating/articleshow/90034081.cms) or leaking of papers.

### The proceedings before Calcutta High Court

A [Petition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LHhwakGVs2PC_5t8UyXm_zTtaVF-QjPM/view?usp=sharing) challenging the Suspension Order was filed before the Calcutta High Court in public interest. The Petitioner has argued that the Suspension Order is illegal because it is - (i) unlawfully issued under Section 144 of CrPC, (ii) issued for purposes not recognised by law, and (iii) is contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court in [_Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India_](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/82461587/). 

The matter was taken up by the Calcutta High Court today. Senior Advocate Ranjan Bachawat appeared on behalf of the Petitioner and argued that the Suspension Order was illegal. He pointed out that:

1. The Suspension Order does not contain any material facts to demonstrate why suspension of all internet services was necessary;
2. It was issued under Section 144 of CrPC even though it is not permissible to do so, according to the decision of the Supreme Court in _Anuradha Bhasin._ Moreover, assuming that it could have been issued under Section 144 of CrPC, it has been issued by an officer not empowered to issue such an order under the provision;
3. It does not comply with the directions of the Supreme Court in _Anuradha Bhasin_ as it is disproportionate;
4. It restricts the right to speech guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution; and
5. It  has been issued for a purpose not mentioned in the Suspension Order, and is patently arbitrary.

In response, Advocate General Gopal Mukherjee made submissions on behalf of the State of West Bengal. He admitted that the Suspension Order has been issued to prevent cheating in exams. However, according to him, this was permissible. Lastly, he asked the Bench to list the matter on 10.02.2022 after the Review Committee constituted under the Telecom Suspension Rules examines the legality of the internet suspension order.

After hearing both sides, the Court has listed the matter for hearing and orders on 10.02.2022 at 2:00 P.M., after the Review Committee has recorded its findings, and the government has placed the findings of the Review Committee before the Court.

The petitioner was represented by Senior Advocate Ranjan Bachawat who was assisted by Shwetank Ginodia from R. Ginodia & Co., Vrinda Bhandari, Abhinav Sekhri, Tanmay Singh, Krishnesh Bapat, Anandita Mishra and Amala Dasarathi.
