As concerns increase in India about the increasing number of shutdowns, Nakul Nayak has authored a paper with a legal analysis of the legal regime on it ([click here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3254857)). Nakul consults as a legal fellow at the Internet Freedom Foundation on online censorship concentrating on online shutdowns and his analysis confirms that the new rules on internet shutdowns issued in August, 2018 are secretive in their operation, lack sufficient safeguards or oversight by an empowered review committee.

Attempting an administrative law analysis, he proposes reforms commencing from the whole-scale constitutionality of the rules (as previously argued by him) to the insertion of a sunset clause. This paper attempts through a legal analysis to consolidate and build on the growing policy literature on internet shutdowns in India to disclose several conceptual and practical problems arising out of the text and practice of the Suspension Rules.
