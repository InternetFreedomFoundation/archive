### **tl;dr**

Since our last report for the month of November, IFF has filed **21 RTI requests and 5 first appeals.** Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and an analysis of the responses we have received from the different public authorities. This report highlights why demanding transparency and accountability from Government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.



### **Why is transparency important?**

The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able to secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.

The Right to Information (RTI) Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from, the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of December, we have filed 21 RTI requests and 5 First Appeals electronically with authorities at the Central level as well as through speed posts with relevant authorities at the States’ levels, concerning the various issues on which we engage with the Government.

**Note**: The number of RTI requests are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month's report may be included in the present report.



### **Data Protection and Privacy**

One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices that will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed **13 RTI requests and 2 first appeals** with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.

Under IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology (FRT). This month, we filed requests with:

1. The [**Tamil Nadu Police Department**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oUuEZsIYKz_sbW0JyMyu_mCWLMcdu8iv/view) regarding the use of a face recognition system by law enforcement.
2. The [Hyderabad Police](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WJhVyyW9SgCTL8INAvb5R5vrFcDQayzG/view) on the use of facial recognition technology by the Hyderabad Police.

**Significant responses received on our RTI applications:**

### **Free Speech and Censorship**

Another focus of our work is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances that may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.

In the last month, we have filed 8 RTI requests and two first appeals to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:

1. The [**Government of Nagaland**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FOJ9HTYDIWzZV6mVLTDREynGEedrCiin/view) on the reported recent internet shutdown from December 05, 2021.
2. The [National Informatics Centre](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M3nw0wQ2BGKe1DmtwwWuAAo5vAPfnsWQ/view?usp=sharing) on interface changes in the RTI portal, including dis-allowance for registration of new users.
3. The [Department of Electronics & Information Technology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19QnPkBVs4oDVvivLABQKQAYf_KfIJ5WX/view) to seek anonymised, statistical information related to orders issued by the Union Government under S.69A of the IT Act, 2000.
4. The [Tamil Nadu Home Department](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oYIZfZH__N5i5X-aTir2mJrrHrrAc8w-/view) on their compliance with the _Anuradha Bhasin_ guidelines.

Apart from these, we have been pursuing information relating to the scope and scale of e-surveillance conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 since 2018. When sought for aggregated (and not detailed!) information in this regard, the Ministry of Home Affairs (‘MHA’) had originally claimed that such information was exempted under the RTI Act for reasons of national security, but on second appeal, the Central Information Commissioner (‘CIC’) said that the exemption did not apply. The first appellate authority was directed to hear the matter again, where MHA made a fresh claim that the information could not be provided because documents pertaining to the information were weeded out from time to time! We have raised this issue and sought for the information in second appeal before the CIC again. Alternatively, we have again sought to hold those in power accountable by filing requests for information for the period after 2018 before:

1. The [Ministry of Home Affairs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/127exxjB9JJQgIKoA4IM9jTmVHS11aNF0/view?usp=sharing) on orders or directions issued by the Competent Authority under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.
2. The [Ministry of Home Affairs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eQswfQdlQ0aUuVcXUIzWovH3CUHe8riw/view?usp=sharing) on requests received by the government from all agencies to issue orders or directions by the Competent Authority under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.
3. The [Ministry of Home Affairs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJFjgff9r1wjqgPQYdqpQJLGWU7lVlHW/view?usp=sharing) on approval requests received by the government from all agencies to issue orders or directions by the Competent Authority under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

We also filed two first appeals with:

1. The [Ministry of Home Affairs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nOyrSID7ZLT10x3LeTZDZUgzgQYQ5vD9/view?usp=sharing) on no answer against our RTI request filed on 14/9/2021, even after the expiry of the statutory period of 30 days.
2. The [Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QFjZCg4u__5s5iGQimQOwQtR9z-jd13D/view?usp=sharing) on no answer against our RTI request filed on 26/11/2021 even after the expiry of the statutory period of 30 days.
