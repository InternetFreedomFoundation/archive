Mr Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Honourable Member of Parliament from Bangalore, has been a vocal proponent of Net Neutrality and has shared common cause with the SaveTheInternet.in Coalition for some time. We are deeply appreciative of his support for our cause.

Subsequent to [TRAI’s regulation on differential pricing](http://www.trai.gov.in/WriteReadData/WhatsNew/Documents/Regulation_Data_Service.pdf) on 8 February 2016, Mr Chandrasekhar submitted [detailed comments to the regulator](http://rajeev.in/rajeev_writes/Discriminatory_Tariffs/Letter_to_TRAI_Chairman_Detailed_Comments_on_TRAI_Order_Feb182016.pdf) on 18 February. Our volunteers reviewed these comments and found points of concern relating to the few differences of opinion SaveTheInternet has had with Mr Chandrasekhar.

We present here [our counterpoints](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8uh0_d_uIhr4xKJuO1qcI_LoX_j4Mw4sWm0RF6jaD8/edit?usp=sharing).
