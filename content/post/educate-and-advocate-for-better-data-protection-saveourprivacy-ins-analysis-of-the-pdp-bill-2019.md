### Tl;dr

Yesterday, [we explained the process of participation](https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/its-the-final-countdown-kinda-on-the-data-protection-bill-saveourprivacy#entry:12648:url) and sending views to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Draft  Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. As we committed today we are making  available a public analysis that helps you discover the top 10 issues  with this legislative proposal. Today we have provided three parts in [a public brief](https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf) that covers the legislative history, a summary of top 10  issues and then a detailed clause wise analysis. We hope this helps you  form your own views and then participate in the consultation to help  bring the power of civic participation to data protection!

**UPDATE 10.02.2020 :** The last date for submission is 25.02.2020 as per [this press communique](http://164.100.47.193/lsscommittee/Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill,%202019/pr_files/Press%20Communique-English%204%20Feb%202020.pdf)â€‹.

### How to participate in the Joint Parliamentary Committee

As we informed you yesterday, the Data Protection Bill, 2019 is finally  stepping towards a finalized version. It may soon pass through  parliament and become law. This revolutionary legislation promises to  bring a level of control back to our digital lives. But this will be  only possible if you participate. To do this you need to send in  comments (ideally three weeks from 22.01.2020) by February 12, 2010 by  sending an email to to [jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in](mailto:jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in) and [mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in](https://saveourprivacy.in/admin/entries/blog/mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in). You can read more about the process in a post we made here.

### Read the #SaveOurPrivacy public analysis

SaveOurPrivacy has worked since May, 2018 as a framework for civil society groups to put forward demands on data protection and surveillance reform. Powered by IFF and comprising of many organisations and volunteers it has prepared a public analysis of the Data Protection Bill, 2019.

It further includes a summary that highlights the top 10 issues with the present version of the Data Protection Bill, 2019. We urge you to go through this and circulate it widely. We have made every effort to break down legal jargon and make it as simple and accessible as possible.
