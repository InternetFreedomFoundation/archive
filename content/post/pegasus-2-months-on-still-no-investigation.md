### tl;dr

In light of the revelations related to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware made in July 2021, the Government of West Bengal has instituted a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the issue. Responding to the Public Notice calling for statements, we have sent across a submission to the Commission. 

### Pegasus: 2 months on, still no investigation…

On July 18, 2021, [The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/project-pegasus-journalists-ministers-activists-phones-spying), as part of an international collaborative investigation titled “Pegasus Project”, revealed that the Israeli spyware firm NSO targeted “over 300 verified Indian mobile telephone numbers, including those used by ministers, opposition leaders, journalists, the legal community, businessmen, government officials, scientists, rights activists and others” through their spyware, Pegasus. The revelation was made on the basis of a leaked database accessed by Paris-based media nonprofit [Forbidden Stories](https://forbiddenstories.org/) and [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/), which contains the list of numbers believed to have been targeted by NSO.

According to [ANI](https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1416800154871468036), the Union Government, in response to a questionnaire sent by the Pegasus Project stated that, “the allegations regarding government surveillance on specific people has no concrete basis or truth associated with it whatsoever”. On [July 19, 2021](https://internetfreedom.in/line-by-line-verification-of-the-it-ministers-statement-on-the-pegasus-hacks/), the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw, presented his statement in response to the Pegasus Project revelations in the Lok Sabha, which was also presented in Rajya Sabha. The statement failed to quell any of the questions raised as the Minister only quoted provisions of the existing surveillance architecture in India and stated that all electronic interception follows due process. On July 28, 2021, the Standing Committee on Information Technology was to have its sitting on the subject ‘Citizens’ data security and privacy’ however the sitting had to be called off due to a [lack of quorum](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-panel-meet-on-pegasus-put-off-after-bjp-mps-refuse-to-take-part-101627497289549.html).

While there are [multiple petitions](https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/pegasus-snoopgate-9-petitions-which-supreme-court-will-hear-today) pending on the issue currently, there is still a lack of investigation on the issue from the Union Government. On August 17, the Supreme Court had [issued notice](https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/supreme-court-issues-notice-central-govt-pegasus-snoopgate-web-portals-weaving-narrative) to the Centre in the pleas after the Union submitted that it was willing to give details regarding the controversy to an expert committee, but not make it public before the Court for fear of national security implications.

However, on July 26, 2021, the Government of West Bengal had set up a [two member Commission of Inquiry](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/bengal-probes-pegasus-what-are-the-powers-of-a-commission-of-inquiry-7425618/) to investigate the issue. Under The Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, a Commission set up by the government shall have the powers of a civil court, while trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. This means that the Commission will have the powers to summon and enforce the attendance of any person from any part of India and examine her on oath, and receive evidence, and it can order requisition of any public record or copy from any court or office. On August 3, 2021, the Commission issued a [public notice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gS0NbBpABSFgPqU60SBEoJcTK2Qw4TL3/view?usp=sharing) calling for statements on the Pegasus revelations.

However, consequently, on August 25, 2021, the Government of West Bengal told the Supreme Court that the two-member Commission of Inquiry, headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Justice Madan B Lokur, [will not proceed](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pegasus-spyware-scandal-west-bengal-says-commission-of-inquiry-wont-proceed-till-petitions-heard-7470131/) until the apex court hears petitions seeking a probe into the alleged surveillance scandal as well as those challenging the state government’s decision to appoint the commission.



### Our submission to the WB Commission
