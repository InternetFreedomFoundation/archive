The SaveTheInternet.in coalition welcomes news reports indicating that the TRAI has ordered Reliance Communications to temporarily suspend operation of the Free Basics zero rating programme given that its current consultation process is on. As repeatedly stated by us, the TRAI and the Government need to speedily put in place net neutrality regulations to protect Indian citizens and an open Internet. We have stressed that the responsible agencies have a duty to act, including enforcing a moratorium on violations of net neutrality till the conclusion of the consultation process.

We call upon the TRAI to provide further information on the suspension order it issued to Reliance Communications on Free Basics. Most importantly, we urge the TRAI and the Ministry of Communications and IT to speedily advance on its larger objective of framing and implementing net neutrality regulations without further delay.
