### tl;dr

IFF’s [Project Panoptic](https://panoptic.in/) was launched on November 27, 2020 to track and raise public awareness around the rapid proliferation of facial recognition technology (FRT) in India. In this post, we take a look at what we have been able to achieve in the one year since as well as how we aim to take this project forward.



### But first, thank you!

Before we go into the details of our actions throughout the course of this past year, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of each and every volunteer who worked on this project with us to make it the success that it is. This includes volunteers from Frappe, DataKind Bangalore as well as other volunteers from the IFF community who were generous with their time and efforts to help the project take form. A special thanks to Shivam Mishra of Frappe who helped us build out the Project Panoptic website.

### Next steps

In the past one year, we have been able to make incremental progress in our primary goal of raising public awareness around the issue of facial recognition, what it is and the rapid pace at which it is being developed & deployed by government agencies in India. Raising public awareness around these projects is imperative because only with transparency around their deployment can we hope for accountability from the agencies which are deploying them. However, in the coming year we hope to take other steps towards accountability by branching out in our approach to tackling these projects.

Firstly, we aim to draft and help make into law a specific legislation which will help regulate the use of this technology by government agencies. While our ideal goal is a complete ban on the use of this technology, we have to be pragmatic in our approach. Since enormous amounts of resources have already been allocated for acquiring this technology, with more tenders being released everyday, it is unlikely that the government will heed our call to ban the use of this harmful technology. Thus, our next best effort will be to ensure that use of this technology is regulated by a strict law that would ensure that use is restricted to only certain scenarios and that oversight mechanisms are in place to protect against misuse.

Secondly, we hope to take meaningful action against any illegal and overbroad violations of our fundamental rights by asking the Courts to intervene in the eventuality that misuse or mass surveillance occurs. At this juncture in the development of this technology it is essential that in addition to strict legislation, precedents are also set to limit the use of this technology, especially by police and law enforcement agencies.
