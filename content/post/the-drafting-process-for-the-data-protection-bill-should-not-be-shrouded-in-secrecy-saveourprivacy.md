This post is a part of our work to support a community oriented online campaign for a credible, user centric privacy law at [www.saveourprivacy.in](http://www.saveourprivacy.in) 

In a previous [blog](https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/rtis-filed-on-the-data-protection-bill-consultation) on 20th October, 2018, we stated how we had filed RTI’s with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (“Meity”) for the consultation on the Draft Data Protection Bill. We had filed two RTIs in order to understand the real picture behind this. First, to get the details of all the comments sent to the Ministry. Second, apart from Ministry, who all are reviewing the comments and re-drafting the law.

1. With regard to the details of the comments, the response was only limited to the number of submissions received (624) and no other information was provided. The request was disposed of by stating that the information was confidential and was to be examined by the Ministry.

1. To the second RTI, Meity replied, “_No information available with Cyber Law and Cyber Security Group of this Ministry_”. We are completely unsatisfied by the responses of the Meity.

The answers received are insufficient, evasive and smack of secrecy. Right? Should such a secretive process be adopted to draft a significant law which will deeply impact a growing number of Indians who use technology in their lives.

We will not give up and yesterday we filed first appeals (link to [appeal 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LKE-1DkhtFYlZfZTdqLUVQN1pQcnFGZXhVUVRZaUhfOVVZ/view?usp=sharing) and [appeal 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LKE-1DkhtFbVZIQldLc2Jid0x1bTljeFppYmhsUFVVMF9v/view?usp=sharing)) against these responses. We will continue pushing and take these to their logical conclusion.
