### tl;dr

Since our last report for the month of June, IFF has filed 29 RTI requests, 3 First Appeals and 3 Second Appeals. Here, we give you an overview of the requests filed and why demanding transparency and accountability from Government authorities is one of the key elements in our fight to protect digital rights.

### Why is transparency important?

The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority by ensuring that citizens are able secure access to information under the control of public authorities. Facilitating such access is necessary to ensure that democratic processes are not subverted by public authorities acting under private interests. Where transparency is not upheld as a value of public decision-making, citizens are at a disadvantage when it comes to keeping a check on abuse of power by the public authorities.

The Right to Information (RTI) Act is thus one of the most important tools at the disposal of the public to engage with, and demand transparency and accountability from, the Government. We use the Act to routinely extract information about various ongoing policies and projects that the Government launches. In the month of July, we have filed 29 RTI requests, 3 First Appeals and 3 Second Appeals electronically with authorities at the Central level, concerning the various issues on which we engage with the Government.

**Note**: Number of RTIs are calculated from the date of the previous report. While we try to make this a monthly report, some RTI requests from the previous month that were filed after that month's report may be included in the present report.

### **Data Protection and Privacy**

One of our key areas of work is ensuring that public authorities respect data privacy and engage in practices which will ensure that the right to privacy is protected. We filed 21 RTI requests with various authorities this month to ask for information pertaining to newly introduced projects which affect the data privacy of Indian citizens.

Under IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology (FRT). We also enquire about the related surveillance technologies that the public authorities deploy. This month, we filed requests with:

It stated that it has incurred an expenditure of Rs 165.43 crores for installation of FRT systems in 4 airports, without specifically naming any.

### Net Neutrality

Through the [**SaveTheInternet**](https://savetheinternet.in/) campaign, we were able to secure a massive public victory for net neutrality in India. This resulted in legal rules which now require internet service providers and telecoms companies to treat all data equally. Protecting net neutrality in India is one of our most important campaigns. For this, we filed 3 requests with:

1. The [**Department of Telecommunications**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PKvqq6v05oJe32NNgBV0dOGZWsqbA2Ak/view?usp=sharing) **** and the [**Telecom Regulatory Authority of India**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S6tylXWZ_iZ_bBOqKB_iuMh8l90Ejjs9/view?usp=sharing) regarding Memo forwarded by the Department of Telecommunications dated June 25, 2021 to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) expressing their discomfort in implementing TRAI’s recommendations of establishing a Multi Stakeholder Body to enforce the Net Neutrality Principles.

[**IFF/2021/031**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AmNhXuX7fcT3oWg18DqTfD21Wh7culCq/view?usp=sharing) on June 13, 2021.

### **Free Speech and Censorship**

Another focus of our work is to ensure that freedom of speech and expression on the internet is protected and that unnecessary censorship does not lead to a chilling effect on people’s fundamental rights. For this, we routinely file RTI requests to demand accountability for instances which may hamper free speech on the internet such as website blocking or internet shutdowns.

In the last month, we have filed 4 RTI requests to demand accountability for violations of free speech on the internet with:

1. The [**Department of Electronics and Information Technology**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pUPUhUNl3buGtAHEvwHl6CXBdAa_ngat/view?usp=sharing) regarding the [**exemption granted to Apple Inc**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-letter-to-apple-asking-for-it-rules-compliance-withdrawn-7405137/). for compliances under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021.
2. The [**Department of Electronics & Information Technology**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mvBId9lSksg0YK1l1fHG56rtdtiL9_f9/view?usp=sharing) regarding plausible complaints received for blocking the web application named “Sulli Deals”.
3.

We had also filed 2 Second Appeals with:

1. The [**Central Information Commission**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8zkW5Q1TgDe9c_H0gIV7XmH44sNDJ1g/view?usp=sharing) against the [**decision**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13v_Os_lAqN6bSpm_PVjm3BdOOMI9sUhK/view?usp=sharing) of the First Appellate Authority of the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited-Delhi Office regarding our request for information about website blocking orders between 2020 and 2021.
2. The [**Central Information Commission**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLohZRl-UZsbhtDD9-u-oKHXyJ-QkNQZ/view?usp=sharing) against the [**decision**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4STXis6G6fb5lMePpdMdECz9L5vsRbG/view?usp=sharing) of the First Appellate Authority of the Department of Telecommunications **** regarding our request for information about website blocking orders between 2020 and 2021.

Further, in our RTI requests on surveillance orders issued by the MHA, the CIC passed [**an order**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wfSoI7LMcw9tQbsg1MoBpflj2h6UPIUu/view?usp=sharing) on May 17, 2021, directing the first appellate authority (FAA) to re-hear the case. Accordingly, the FAA conducted a hearing on June 24, 2021. The FAA was also directed to provide a copy of his decision by July 31, 2021 to the CIC, with a copy to us. However, we have not received any updates yet, either from the FAA or from the CIC.

### Innovation

Every segment of our nation’s society and industry stand to benefit by being connected to an open Internet. Stringent permission based systems often deny Indians an opportunity to have unbiased access to the digital solutions.

In this regard, we closely follow new regulations that impact our digital entrepreneurs and this month we filed 1 RTI request with:

1. The [**Ministry of Consumer Affairs**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10i9FQmhchlVLbPj8xlBli5O7xyFGaccL/view?usp=sharing) **** requesting information on the representation sent by the Internet Freedom Foundation bearing reference no. [**IFF/2021/072**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sl80KLCj9M_qlj5fMNeegFz_m0qqTFaR/view?usp=sharing) on July 20, 2021
