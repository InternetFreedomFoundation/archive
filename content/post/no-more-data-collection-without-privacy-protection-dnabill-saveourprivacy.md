In the present winter session of parliament a key proposal impacting our privacy may pass into law. The, ****DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2018**** is up for consideration & passage and we need to oppose it.

This law allows law enforcement agencies to collect DNA samples, create “DNA profiles” and databanks for criminal investigations. All of this is happening without a credible privacy law in place. We ask, given that a process to make a privacy law is ongoing, what is the tearing hurry make a law to collect our DNA and put them in databanks?

There are several problems with this law which was not put up for public consultation and its final form was never published for stakeholder inputs. Its functionaries have little or no institutional independence or autonomy, it is created at a huge cost of 25 crores (initial outlay) and has no clear provisions for deletion of DNA entries. There are no provisions which inform people how their data will be shared and they will have little to no control over it.

Given the vast concerns to our privacy, we have prepared a legislative brief to inform our lawmakers the top legal and policy reasons to oppose it. We will be seeking opportunities to brief them and inform them about the dangers of this ill considered legislation.
