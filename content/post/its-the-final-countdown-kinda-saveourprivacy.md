### Tl;dr

The important issue of our data and how it will be protected is right now pending in Parliament. In December it was refereed to a joint parliamentary committee that is now inviting views and comments from the public. To help you do this, we have prepared a summary of the Data Protection Bill, 2019 with our top 10 concerns that we will post out tomorrow. Today, we urge you to share this post that will inform your friends, family and social networks and help them get ready to participate in this democratic exercise!

**UPDATE 10.02.2020 :** The last date for submission is 25.02.2020 as per [this press communique](http://164.100.47.193/lsscommittee/Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Personal%20Data%20Protection%20Bill,%202019/pr_files/Press%20Communique-English%204%20Feb%202020.pdf)​.

### The joint parliamentary committee

The Data Protection Bill has been a long time coming. We finally seem to moving towards the final stages of this much awaited legislation with the government draft being considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee. When this committee was formed on December 11, 2019 [we wrote to all of it's members](https://internetfreedom.in/transparent-and-accessible-joint-committee/) asking for more public participation and we are glad it has been opened up to public comments. However, many of our requests including preparing local language translations of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and public depositions do not seem to have found favour. We promise to keep agitating these demands.

Please find below a link to a tweet from the Lok Sabha Secretariat spelling out the process.
