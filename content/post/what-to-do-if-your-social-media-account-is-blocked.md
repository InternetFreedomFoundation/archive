### Background

Free Speech is a constitutional guarantee we all are entitled to as citizens of a democratic state. However, this is not an absolute right. While Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution recognizes that freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right for every Indian citizen, Article 19(2) limits this right to “reasonable restrictions”. It is this vague verbiage that has often fuelled overbroad state interferences on free speech and arbitrary gag orders in the pretext of safeguarding “national interest.”

### Is Online Censorship increasing in India?

In recent times, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp have emerged as the most common portal for mobilising the opinions and views of a diverse demography all over the world. Uruguayan journalist Eduadrdo Galeano had once said, “The walls are the publishers of the poor.” Manifest as our Facebook timelines or Instagram feeds, indeed the ”walls” that the social media has accorded us has revolutionised the access to and the exercise of free speech for one and all. Yet, we are witnessing an unprecedented scale of clampdowns on social media where arbitrary censorship of online speech is increasingly being directed against any voice of dissent. Twitter officials state that they have observed a steep rise in the orders passed by the government directing them to block specific accounts on their platform over the past year.

From an estimated **3600** in all of 2019 to **9800** in 2020 to almost **6000** within the first six months of 2021, the government takedown orders to Twitter have more than doubled in the recent past.

In March 2021, in response to an RTI application filed by Internet Freedom Foundation, the Department of Telecommunications informed us that “94 blocking orders were issued by DoT during 2020 & 2021 pursuant to orders of different Hon'ble courts and 3725 website/URL blocked or access disabled pursuant to these orders.”  This is extremely worrying since social media platforms have penetrated almost every facet of our lives and recently, as the health crisis in India was engorged by a fatal second wave of the Covid-19 infections, we witnessed how information on life saving resources like leads for oxygen, hospital beds, critical medicines etc were tirelessly shared and arranged for over the social media platforms.

### What are the Legal Grounds for Blocking Orders?

* **Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000** allows the Central Government to issue directions to any network provider to block public access to any content online when it is satisfied with the necessity of such an order.
* **Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking For Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009** delineate the process and powers of the Central Government to direct social media platforms to block specific online content. Rule(s) 6 to 9 elaborate on the process of issuing such blocking orders. However, the inexactitude of the terms included in such provisions and the “emergency” safeguards included therein facilitate arbitrary blocking orders without providing any prior notice to the concerned persons, which effectively ciminialise dissent and dilute the observations of the honourable Supreme Court of India in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India as well as Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India. Rule 16 further adds to the lack of transparency by mandating that strict confidentiality shall be maintained regarding all the requests and complaints received and actions taken thereof.
* **Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021** obligates social media platforms to remove within thirty six hours any given information from their “computer resources” upon receiving such directions from any government agencies or orders from any competent court. These Rules enlist the categories under which a content can be impugned and such blocking orders can be passed. Further, it imposes a stringent obligation upon the social media platforms to identify the originator of the impugned content and promptly comply with the blocking orders. Alternatively social media platforms stand to lose their “safety harbour” against criminal liability that section 79 of the Information Technology Act confers upon them.
* **Privacy policies and Community Guidelines** of the respective social media platforms list down specific instances wherein they disable access to accounts or remove content if any violation is reported. While the particular instances may differ for different social media platforms, the broad categories revolve around potential harms to the human rights of the users. Further, in each instance, the users are given an opportunity to appeal against such a decision and upon the resolution of the issue, the platforms are bound to restore the account or the content, as the case may be.
