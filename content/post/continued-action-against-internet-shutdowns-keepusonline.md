**Internet shutdowns are a growing national menace**

The internet continues to be shut down in different parts of India with increasing frequency. As stated in a [recent op-ed authored](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) by Apar Gupta, Executive Director and Raman Chima, Trustee and Co-founder of IFF, published in the [Hindustan Times,](https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/there-is-no-evidence-that-internet-shutdowns-work/story-4aERxaY1OMNTG8siM0iMMM.html) "_The answer has been evasion as the central government till date has refused to provide any count or centralise a reporting and disclosure system. We should not fear such data, and that such calculation may put us to shame, for even_ [_existing news reports_](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/india) _, India enjoys the top rank as the global leader in the number of Internet shutdowns._"

This is a matter of national shame. We are losing on our rights and India's continued potential to lead the knowledge and skills economy which relies on reliable internet access. We have now started reaching out to parliamentarians on this issue.

This continues our working model of activism where our public engagement is towards institutional outcomes. A short recap. We have through [the #KeepUsOnline campaign](https://keepusonline.in/) reached out to 15,000 individual and 80 institutional signatories who petitioned the government to condemn internet shutdowns. We then followed it up with a [series of RTIs](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-disclosure-on-indias-shutdown-law-keepusonline/) which demonstrate the legal rules for shutdowns were made secretly, and most recently supported a [legal analysis](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3254857) of these rules by one of the domain experts in the area, Nakul Nayak.

We will continue working against internet shutdowns, meeting people, talking to them about them and ensuring India has a better rank in 2019. Do follow our updates.

**So, what is IFF doing about it?**

Next stop is parliament and we are looking towards our legislators. The dates for the winter session have been announced which commences from December 11. We sensed there was a need to reach out to the offices of various legislators in advance. As subject area experts we are attempting to set up time, talk to their offices and explain this issue to them. Our hope through such knowledge sharing and to enable greater parliamentary engagement on Internet Shutdowns in India. To enable this, two volunteers (Arpitha and Hardik) authored a brief of this issue which is now being sent across alongwith meetings to put this issue across to several parliamentarians.

**How can you help?**

* **Call on your lawmakers:** We urge each person to reach out to their member of parliament and discuss this issue.
