## What is a Donation Matching Program?

Internet Freedom Foundation is hosting a Donation Matching Program that can help you double your donation and maximise the impact. A donation matching program is one where a donor has pledged to give a significant financial contribution to the organisation to match all donations from other supporters within a certain timeframe, up to their pledged amount. 

IFF is a domestically funded non-profit organisation that seeks to advance fundamental rights with technology. We work on digital rights advocacy through sustained and strategic legal and policy interventions and help preserve the open internet. 

We are excited that Amod Malviya is committing a donor matching program to IFF for the month of March. Amod is a seasoned technologist and a respected entrepreneur. He feels strongly about the open source world, technology as a socio-cultural tool and the future of  technology in India. This donor matching program is a 1:1 match which runs from March 1st till March 31st, 2020. For every rupee you donate to us in the month of March, it will be matched by Amod up to a limit of Rs. 3 lakhs.

So, what better way to end the financial year on a giving-back note and being able to double the impact? Donate generously and remember, all donations to IFF are tax exempt and help you claim a write off (up to 50% as per permissible limits).

Let us give back to the internet! Keep it free, open and healthy!
