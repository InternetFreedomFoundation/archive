IFF has adopted this [PoSH Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15fWA3fFANRuCYMMXxb9_vkz7MMGuCVuU/view) on 20 September, 2021 and it is also linked below. In furtherance of the law set down by the [Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013](https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A2013-14.pdf), and the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Rules, 2013, and our personal commitment towards ensuring a work environment free from sexual harassment of any nature, IFF is bringing into force this [Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15fWA3fFANRuCYMMXxb9_vkz7MMGuCVuU/view?usp=sharing).

This Policy was drafted and adopted with legal and practical advice and assistance from the [One Future Collective](https://www.onefuturecollective.org/) (OFC). In order to make sure the IFF staff understood the meaning and application of the policy, OFC also organised 2 workshops around gender sensitivity and conduct in the workplace along with 2 additional workshops for the members of the Internal Complaints Committee to help them understand the roles and responsibilities of this committee. The contact information of the IC Members can be found on Page 13 of the document linked above. The complaint can also be submitted to the ICC via email to [posh@internetfreedom.in], or by filling out the online complaint form here at: [https://shrl.ink/urMG](https://shrl.ink/urMG), or by post to E-215, Third Floor, East of Kailash, New Delhi - 110065, India.

The Policy linked above contains more insight on Applicability of the Policy and also information regarding how a person can file a complaint with the Internal Complaints Committee. IFF is committed to creating a safe and healthy work environment for every person who works with the organisation and will also build more institutional policies, like an Anti-Bullying Policy to strengthen our institutional commitment towards the development of a healthier work environment.
