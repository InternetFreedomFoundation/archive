## **Why do we need your help?**

COVID-19 hit us hard but we are not taking it lying down. We are accelerating the pace of our work and growing [a digital rights community](https://internetfreedom.in/p/afccb357-8e1b-49cb-9f16-1ab919c3b464/forum.internetfreedom.in). The team at Internet Freedom Foundation is working hard to ensure that our mission continues even as social distancing guidelines and restrictions have caused us to shift the way we operate.

We need to upgrade our cyber security infrastructure since our small team of 6 staffers has moved remotely due to the ongoing pandemic. This unexpected shift from physical spaces towards complete online dependency has required most of us to utilise personal computing devices (we have purchased one office laptop in the past). As we do more civic literacy, we also need to harden our cyber security and need to make essential investments for it.

We need your help to raise money to upgrade our resources for ease of work. _Most of the staff members at IFF are still using their own personal devices for work purposes which is less than ideal._ If we’ve learned anything from the pandemic as a society, it’s that technology and internet access is essential to our everyday life and that there’s a need to extend and re-purpose our technology. We are launching the **Internet Freedom Device Drive** hoping to be able to raise about **Rs. 10,00,000**. This is a substantial sum of money with which we hope to be able to purchase 5 laptops, software licenses, YubiKeys and high speed internet connection for all the staff members for a year.
