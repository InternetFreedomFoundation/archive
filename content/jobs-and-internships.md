## Internships

**Important Note: We thank applicants for their interest but we are not looking for legal or policy interns currently. This page will be updated once we have vacancies for legal or policy interns. However, we are accepting applications from individuals with experience in video editing, design and web development.**

Depending on our capacity and need, we work with interns from domains not restricted to technology, policy or law. For instance, are you an online campaigner? Or are you a whiz at web design, infographics or illustrations? Or do you make really good Youtube videos for civic education? Apply to us. We need your help.

All internship positions are usually at our office in Delhi. However, due to Covid-19, we have moved towards remote work and are accepting remote interns as well. All internships come with a stipend. Our internship programme hopes to grow youth leadership in the domain of digital rights and will be for a period of 2 - 3  months (applicants wishing to intern for shorter periods need to establish high competence and exceptional circumstances in their covering letter).

So if you have ideas on how to advance core values of human freedom and the promise of technology, [send us an application](mailto:jobs@internetfreedom.in) with your resume, a covering letter describing your interest and how you would you like to contribute to IFF. Any applications without a covering letter which includes a statement explaining their interest in digital rights will be summarily rejected. We accept applications on a rolling basis and we encourage you to apply 45-60 days before your preferred internship dates.
