The Internet Freedom Foundation advocates for your right to privacy, and we work to protect your privacy when you visit our websites and engage with us, online and offline. We wrote this Privacy Policy, and will update it as necessary, to let you know how we protect your personal data and keep it confidential.

We do not rent or sell visitor or donor information to third parties. We will not transfer or share this information with other third parties unless compelled by law, and we will vigorously challenge any overbroad government request to access it. This Privacy Policy applies to all the Internet Freedom Foundation personnel and volunteers who have access to your data (“we” or “us”) when you sign petitions and visit our campaign websites.

## What we collect

We strive to collect as little personal data as we need to further our mission.

We collect information when you visit our site, use our petition tool, and subscribe to our campaigns or mailing lists. We’ll let you know what information is required for each action, and try to require the least amount of information necessary. This will usually involve details such as your name and email.

We collect information regarding visits to our website. Like most servers, IP addresses [which include location data, browser, operating system, visiting time (local and server), session, actions per visit, page views per visit, returning visitors, and referring site information] are logged automatically on access to our website however these IP addresses are not tied or collated against the responses that you send by using our forms and petitions. We undertake to delete these IP logs after a 90 day retention period as required by law.

When you sign the petition, we require a name, e-mail address, with some further optional fields. For organisations who wish to lend support to www.savetheinternet.in, www.saveourprivacy.in or www.keepusonline.in we will do a manual check on the email address that you provide and further fields will be mandatory. The link to the image of your organisation that you provide may be used by us for display on our campaign websites.

The InternetFreedom.in, SaveTheInternet.in, SaveOurPrivacy.in, and Keepusonline.in websites and services are not intended for, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any person under the age of 18. By using our petition tools you agree that you are over the age of 18.

## Cookies

We use cookies for a limited number of purposes. A “cookie” is a tiny element of data that our site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. If you are concerned about your privacy and the use of cookie technology you may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You may also set your browser to refuse the cookies our site attempts to send you. However, if you choose to reject cookies from InternetFreedom.in, SaveTheInternet.in SaveOurPrivacy.in or www.keepusonline.in, some functions on the website may be limited.

## How we store and use your data

We take industry standard security measures to protect personal information under our control from loss, misuse, and breach, but like with every website, there are risks associated with uploading your information online.

When you are asked for your personal information, you are sharing that information with InternetFreedom.in, SaveOurPrivacy.in and keepusonline.in and its team alone, unless stated otherwise. We use this information to further our mission, to further digital rights online. You retain the right to view and request copies, deletion, and modification of the personal data we collect from you. Contact [legal@internetfreedom.in](mailto:legal@internetfreedom.in) to start exercising these rights.

We store contact data for our mailing list subscription and sending you campaign information to which we seek specific and prior consent in addition to this policy. This data is stored in our contact relationship database (CRM).

## Social Media and third party platforms

We use social media and third party platforms to advance our mission. These platforms and applications are often provided by third party service providers. Please see their privacy policies for more information, and let us know if you have specific concerns.

## Updates and Contact

We’ve updated this policy on 13 Febuarary 2019, alongside updates to our campaign websites and platforms. We previously updated our privacy policy on 11 May 2018 and 17 March 2017, in conjunction with the launch of our new website and subsequently made minor edits based on feedback from our users. If we update or change it we will send you an email and contact you.
