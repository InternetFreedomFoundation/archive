## How can we help you by becoming a member? 

IFF fights for everyday Indians like you. It only makes sense that we are funded by you as well. Today, we have 176 members who signed up and provide us support on a monthly basis. So, when a court or a regulator asks who funds IFF and who we represent, we answer emphatically, "the people of India!". This is why we follow a unique membership model which starts as low as Rs. 100 per month upto Rs. 1,500 per month. 

Today we need to grow this number of members. This is needed so we can not only meet our daily expenses but cause greater impact. Only over the last month, despite the lockdown we have gone to court for internet access, worked collaboratively to ensure important victories on Aarogya Setu. All of this impact is because of our members. So in order to grow this impact sustainably, we require a stable source of income every month. 

So help us retain our autonomy, transparency and independence. It will give our team confidence to continue our work fearlessly, with a sense of security. Adding 50 more members will make a big impact on our finances and will help us go a long way! 

If you like the work we do, please consider becoming a member. If you're already a member, share what made you join the fight. Ask your friends and family to join you! **Fund digital rights. Fund IFF.**
