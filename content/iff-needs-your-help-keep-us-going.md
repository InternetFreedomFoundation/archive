The past year has brought  extraordinary challenges for IFF. But with support from our donors and community members, we have met the challenges with resilience, innovation and continued impact. To continue meeting 2022's growing challenges, we are counting on the support of our generous donors.

On October 1, 2021 [the new RBI guidelines on recurring transactions](https://www.cnbctv18.com/personal-finance/faqs-rbis-new-auto-debit-rules-kick-in-from-today-answers-to-all-your-queries-on-impact-and-resolution-10960602.htm) came into effect and we faced a 70% drop off in memberships, shaving off 2.5-3 lakh INR per month. Our membership numbers have plummeted to 177 as on October 20, 2021 and we expect further drop offs as fresh signups cannot be authorised.

**At this critical juncture, IFF needs your help.** 

We are expecting a period of six months for systems to stabilise and for us to recover IFF’s member base. At present to the many donors and members who are reaching out — we do not have *any* payment method that will *not* present technical difficulties for recurring donations. The only alternative is one time donations.

To overcome this burn rate, we have worked back from our estimated costs and earmarked a sum of **Rs. 30 Lakhs** that we need to raise by **January 1, 2022**. This is an ambitious target, and it will need all of our supporters to chip in with a one time donation.

**​​**Your support is more crucial than ever, to ensure that our mission** to protect and advance your digital rights **** keeps going **during this time of great need.** ** Your contribution will not only help us meet the challenges of the moment, but also allow us to continue to protect your digital liberties — with compassion, excellence and accountability. **Fund digital rights. Fund IFF!**
