The Internet Freedom Foundation, being born from the SavetheInternet.in movement, is strongly committed to working on and protecting network neutrality in India.

We have adopted the definition of net neutrality by Prof. Vishal Misra who states that it means, “the Internet be maintained as an open platform, on which network providers treat all content, applications and services equally, without discrimination. This includes ensuring that network providers do not supply any competitive advantage to specific apps/services, either through pricing or Quality of Service”. We believe all aspects of network neutrality require protection through clear government rules and regulations.

Net neutrality allows us to have the choice to visit and experience every site or application equally without any discrimination in terms of price, speed or availability from a telecom company. This freedom allows us to create, communicate and collaborate with people across the globe and for businesses to combine audio, video and text, and reimagine consumer experience. We want an open Internet, where everyone has an equal opportunity to use the sites and services they want, when they want, irrespective of which provider they use to connect to the Internet.

The SavetheInternet.in website helped more than million Indians voice their support for net neutrality to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). This has been an unprecedented public response in India’s policy making history. The public support for net neutrality came from a diverse group of people including - citizens, businesses, startups and political leaders. We hope to build further support for net neutrality through an internet-enabled model of public participation.
