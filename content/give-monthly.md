Over the past year, IFF has had a significant impact in defending India's digital rights. This has only been possible because of the support of our community, including our members, donors, and volunteers. Your donations fund our strategic litigation, public advocacy, consultations with government authorities, staff salaries, and operational costs. Because of this, we are able to do critical work in the spheres of privacy, surveillance technology, internet access, digital security and literacy, transparency, innovation, and more. For example, making [Co-Win more accessible, friendly and privacy compliant](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-high-court-issues-directions-on-suggestions-to-improve-the-cowin-platform/). This has been because people like you have trusted us with your generosity and then let us do what we do best.

To help us further our mission, we are now setting up a goal to reach 50 new monthly members starting at just Rs.100/month in the month of July. We want your support to help us raise awareness and funds for our work as it’s extremely crucial for us to continue working with autonomy, transparency and passionate commitment to digital rights!

We sincerely believe in the power of digital advocacy through community learning and contribution. **Join us, tell your friends and family, and help us grow our digital rights collective substantially in just a couple weeks, so we may focus on long-term impact, commitment, and sustainability for the people of India!**
