# FAQs


#### Why should I contribute to IFF?
	
IFF champions digital rights, privacy, and free speech in India, which is vital to safeguarding online freedoms and securing fundamental rights for a growing community of Indians, who are connected online. When asked who funds us and whom we represent, our answer is easy - "the people of India!" Thus, it is important that the core base of our financial support comes from a donor base of ordinary internet users like you. 

#### What does IFF plan to do with public funding? 

All donations are 50% tax-deductible, and all the funds are directly used to sustain our work. IFF's work involves strategic litigation in courts, policy advocacy, representations to public authorities, engaging with the Right to Information Act, and digital literacy. IFF uses the funds to pay staff/contractor salaries and scale up its existing areas of work.You can read more on our [finances and disclosures here](https://internetfreedom.in/transparency-and-finances/). 

#### What does my membership letter and card get me? 

Your membership card and letter is a statement of gratitude and personal recognition that we consider you an integral part of IFF. It gives you priority access to exclusive events and meetups. All membership cards are valid for a period of 1 year, irrespective of the term of your donation.

#### What's with the IFF membership goodies?

We send out member merchandise kits that include a set of laptop stickers, card games, mugs, and notebooks based on the level of support in regular batches every month. These goodies are not meant for sale and are sent as a token of our appreciation to our members. Due to the ongoing pandemic, there might be possible delays in deliveries, as we are ensuring the highest degree of social distancing measures and safety for our staff.

#### What are IFF quarterly calls and when will they take place?

We organise the members' calls with IFF leadership, including the executive director and trustees, every quarter to discuss our work, fundraising, and the impact we have had in the previous quarter. These calls also give us an opportunity to listen to the thoughts and concerns of our supporters. You can access the previous IFF quarterly members’ calls [here](http://https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgcwCSsOJipovlZ5S6VdoKF_MsBgmCQ8J).


#### Why are you asking for a recurring donation ? 

Victory on digital rights requires long term and strategic advocacy action. Recurring donations are the most reliable source of revenue and help us build a consistent and predictable capital flow to plan our expenses and build capacity accordingly. Each rupee counts towards internet freedom!


#### How do I cancel my recurring donation? 

You can cancel anytime by writing to us at donate@internetfreedom.in. We would encourage you though to keep your donations for a term of a year (at the very least)

#### How do I renew my halted membership? 

You can update your linked card or switch to another method of payment to renew your halted membership. Alternatively, you can sign up for the membership again or make a one time annual payment as per your preferred tier. In case you need a direct link to update the card, please drop us a line at donate@internetfreedom.in

#### Are my payment details safe? 

Yes, your payment details are secure. We believe in keeping the absolute least amount of data necessary for keeping in touch (your name and email) and regulatory tax compliance (payment details and your PAN) and will resist overbroad requests for our donor’s data. We lean towards protecting your privacy in line with our policy. 

#### Will I get a receipt to claim a 80G tax exemption? 

Yes, you will receive an 80G tax exemption receipt as soon as you make a donation via email. For recurring donors, the consolidated 80G receipt is sent across at the end of the financial year in March every year. If you haven’t received a copy, please write to us at donate@internetfreedom.in and we will send it across.

#### Are my payment details safe?

Yes, your payment details are secure. We believe in keeping the absolute least amount of data necessary for keeping in touch (your name and email) and regulatory tax compliance (payment details, address, and PAN) and will resist overbroad requests for our donor data. We lean towards protecting your privacy in line with our policy.

#### Who has given money to IFF till now?

Beyond the Trustees who chipped in with initial contributions, more than 3000 supporters have donated to us over the course of time. We welcome all donations and hope to grow a large, diverse donor-base of Indians cutting across all regional, gender, caste, and language barriers -- united in the belief of realising their fundamental rights with technology.
