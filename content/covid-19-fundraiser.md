<p style="text-align:center;">We've raised 6,00,000. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SUPPORT!</p>

## Why do we need your help? 
Covid-19 pandemic was a major and unanticipated hit to our fundraising growth. We are in need of your help to remain effective and continue the work on digital rights with agility, pace and continuity. As a start, we are asking you today to cover the salary of one IFF staffer for a year. An average salary with operational costs comes to about INR 6,00,000 per annum. 

Your contribution will help a motivated, young and talented professional to work with financial stability and courage. To tirelessly fight against internet shutdowns and mass surveillance projects, for ensuring net neutrality and freedom of speech and expression. This list goes on. 

In a Post-Covid world, the surveillance technologies being put in place rampantly now will only become stronger. It's important we fight back now, to secure our constitional values during and post Covid. Where digital rights and access to a safe, open and free internet is ensured for all Indians.


We need your help now more than ever. Help IFF secure your digital rights by securing one person's salary for the year. **Fund Digital Rights. Fund IFF.**
