From [This is Net Neutrality](https://www.thisisnetneutrality.org/), maintained by [Access](https://www.accessnow.org/):

> Net neutrality requires that the Internet be maintained as an open platform, on which network providers treat all content, applications and services equally, without discrimination.

From professor Vishal Misra of Columbia University, a leading authority on net neutrality:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Internet is a platform where ISPs provide no competitive advantage to specific apps/services, either through pricing or QoS &#10;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NetNeutrality?src=hash">#NetNeutrality</a></p>&mdash; Vishal Misra (@vishalmisra) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalmisra/status/631285727024672768">August 12, 2015</a></blockquote>

The SaveTheInternet.in Coalition has adopted the following definition, using the Access definition as a base and adding Vishal Misraâ€™s explicit clarification:

> Net neutrality requires that the Internet be maintained as an open platform, on which network providers treat all content, applications and services equally, without discrimination. This includes ensuring that network providers do not supply any competitive advantage to specific apps/services, either through pricing or Quality of Service.
