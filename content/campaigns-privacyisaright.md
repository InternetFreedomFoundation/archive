+++


The Privacy Is A Right campaign aims to create awareness of the fundamental Right to Privacy and to provide a language for its articulation in India. We advocate for a legal framework in which the user is placed at the center of ownership and control over their own data. In principle we support limiting government access to personal data and protecting encryption. 

This campaign is still in a stage of development and discussion. We welcome ideas, thoughts and comments before it is christened formally.
