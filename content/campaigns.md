Public campaigns to promote online freedom are central to our work â€” the Internet Freedom Foundation traces its origin to the successful SaveTheInternet.in campaign for Net Neutrality.

In any campaign or project, our aims are to:

* Inform and educate citizens by simplifying complex policy narratives and explaining how it impacts them personally.
* Build support among citizens, businesses and other organizations for the position that promotes freedom.
* Constructively engage with policy makers across political lines to bring about positive changes.

Campaigns we have been a part of include:

* [SaveOurPrivacy.in](https://saveourprivacy.in)
